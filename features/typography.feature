Feature: Typography 

In order to help communicate the Guardian's visual brand across platforms
As a designer
I want to use the Egyptian and TitleFont typefaces

    Scenario: Egyptian loaded on to the page in regular, bold, italic via css3
    Scenario: TitleFont loaded on to the page in thick, thin
    Scenario: Fonts should be efficiently served (Eg, localstorage, loaded async) 
    Scenario: Fonts should be securely stored & deployed (to the agreement of legal) 
    Scenario: Fonts should default to 'Georgia, serif'
    Scenario: Fonts should be served in WOFF and OTF formats
