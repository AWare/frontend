# ContentApi errors borked the fronts

### Summary

Over the night of 25/26 March 2013, NGW fronts intermittently stopped updating following edits in the fronts tool.
The tool itself intermittently showed entire collections as consisting of unavailable content. The reason was:
* ContentApi was intermittently returning data with missing fields
* Pressed fronts were dropping whole collections, or just not updating

### More Technical

The content object from ContentApi has a "fields" property, itself and object containing "headline", "shortUrl", etc.
The "fields" property was missing in a percentage of requests - apparently those served from
a misbehaving instance within ContentApi's autoscaling group. Redeploying the ContentApi stack seemed to fix the problem.
However the root cause for the missing "fields" property remains unknown.

The pressing logic in Facia Tool abandons a pressing job (i.e. a page update) if a single content item is invalid,
i.e. is missing certain properties such as "headline" from the "fields" object.
This scenario has not been encountered previously; the
integrity of ContentApi objects was just assumed. Previously, the only case in which pressing would
continue was when content 404'd. We deployed a fix to change this behaviour, so that pressing
continues even if an individual item is invalid.

### Impact

Fronts were regularly failing to update. Certain collections - notably those that consist solely of
a ContentApi backfill such as the first container on /uk - were disappearing and reappearing randomly,
as the periodic re-pressing of them (every 5 minutes) was receiving either good or bad results from ContentApi.

The fronts tool also relies on ContentApi for its UI, so was randomly showing entire collections as broken.
The tool loads entire collections in one request, so was occasionally receiving batches of consistently broken content from
the deficient ContentApi instance.

### Thoughts

More verbose logging of content validation errors would have enabled a faster diagnosis.

### Actions

 - More verbose logging of content validation errors during pressing.
 - Logging of content validation errors within the tool.
