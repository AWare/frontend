In his speech in the Commons he said he wanted to “increase the pace of reform in education” and he brushed aside calls for ministers to be allowed a free vote in the forthcoming EU referendum. He also challenged Labour to prove it backed aspiration by voting for the government’s proposed tax cuts.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In recent days, I have noticed some of the candidates for the Labour leadership seem to have discovered a new word: the word being aspiration. Apparently it has upset John Prescott, he went on television to explain he doesn’t know what it means. I am happy we should spend the next five years explaining what it means and how vital it is to everyone in our country. If the party opposite truly believe in aspiration, they will vote with us to cut people’s taxes so people can spend more of their own money as they choose. If they believe in aspiration, they will be voting with us to cap welfare and use the savings to fund more apprenticeships.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Some may question Cameron’s commitment to one nation politics (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/may/27/queens-speech-2015-politics-live#block-55659dbae4b05f67319af2fa\">11.34am)</a> and it is probably best to interpret Cameron’s constant use of the phrase partly as a sign of how worried Cameron is about the standing of the Conservatives outside England. There is a telling passage on this in the House of Commons’s excellent <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/CBP-7186\">briefing note on the results of the 2015 election (pdf).</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>318 (96%) of the Conservative’s 330 MPs have seats in England, where the party won 40.9% of the vote. The government elected in May 2015 holds the lowest number of Scottish seats of any government. It also won the lowest share of the vote in both Wales (27.2%) and Scotland (14.9%) of any government since 1945. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/27/labour-funding-hit-change-political-levy-bill\"><strong>Labour and union leaders have criticised plans in the Queen’s speech that could lead to the chief source of funding for the Labour party – the trade union political funds – facing big cuts.</strong> </a>As Patrick Wintour reports, the trade union bill, put forward by the frontbench Conservative MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a>, will create a shift from a current system whereby union members have to contract out from paying the political levy to one in which they have to contract in. The change, from a system of inertia to one in which members actively choose to pay, is likely to lead to a big dropoff in income to the unions.<strong> Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary, said this was anti-democratic.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s one rule for the Tory slush fund, hedge funds and another for trade union members.</p> \n   <p>This will not deter or silence the voices of millions of working people who already give their approval for political funds through democratic ballots governed by statute. </p> \n   <p>It will bring state funding for political parties a step nearer. It is not sustainable to allow the elite and companies unfettered and unlimited rights to fund the Tory Party while shackling the bodies that have funded the political opposition to them for more than a century.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Harriet Harman, the acting Labour leader, has told MPs that the reality of the Queen’s speech does not match its rhetoric.</strong> In her speech she said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Queen’s speech talks of “one nation”– yet he sets the nations of the country against each other. </p> \n   <p>The Queen’s speech talks of ‘working people’ – yet he threatens basic rights at work. </p> \n   <p>At a time when our economy, our constitution and our public services are all fragile, we fear this Tory government will make things worse. </p> \n   <p>So as the dust settles, the real question for this Queen’s speech is – will it improve our country, our communities and people’s lives?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Nick Clegg, the outgoing Lib Dem leader, has said Cameron should spell out what he wants to achieve from his EU renegotiation. </strong>In his speech he told MPs:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This must be the first time in living memory that a country’s citizens are being asked to support the outcome of a renegotiation on a matter of such importance to its place in the world without the government of the day setting out in this house what it wants to achieve. </p> \n   <p>And because we do not know what the government considers a successful negotiation, we do not know for sure which side the prime minister will take in a referendum ...</p> \n   <p>So my advice to the government is this: </p> \n   <p>Pursue your renegotiation with the EU, but spell out exactly what you hope to achieve, so that people understand the choice that’s in front of them. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Clegg also said that, although the government was acting now as if it expected to win the referendum easily, it should be careful, because circumstances could change. “Having witnessed two referenda spin off in entirely unpredicted directions in recent years, I would strongly counsel against any complacency,” he said.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has reprimanded SNP MPs for clapping their Westminster leader, Angus Robertson.</strong> Bercow told them:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can I say at the start of the parliament that the convention that we don’t clap in this chamber is very, very, very long-established and widely respected? And it would be appreciated if members would show some respect for that convention. They will get their speaking rights from this chair – of that they can be assured. They will be respected but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this chamber of the House of Commons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/may/27/threat-exit-human-rights-act-convention-dropped-tories-cameron\">Senior Tories are telling David Cameron he must abandon a “deeply offensive” threat to withdraw from the European convention on human rights if he is to win support for his plans to repeal the Human Rights Act.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Lord Wallace of Tankerness, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, has told peers that the Lords has the right to block government legislation – even if it was in the government’s manifesto.</strong> Under the Salisbury convention, peers are supposed to refrain from voting down measures that were in the manifesto of the governing party. In a speech, Wallace acknowledged that. But he implied that the Lords could ignore this in some circumstances.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is of course right and proper that we uphold the measures which allow our revising chamber to remain a self-regulating house. I do not question the right of the House of Commons and a government who command the confidence of it to have its legislation dealt with in a constructive manner by this House.</p> \n   <p> But we may wish to reflect on the strength of the mandate of a government, which secured less than 37% of the popular vote on a turnout of 66%, should it seek to drive through ill-thought through and reactionary legislation without the robust scrutiny and the proper checks and balances, provided by this house. The government would do well to remember that the Cunningham report on the conventions of the UK parliament, which recognised the right of this house, in extreme and exceptional circumstances, to say no. The importance of the House of Lords retaining the right to say no is that it is that power which brings the government to the table in a constructive frame of mind ...</p> \n   <p>This house has demonstrated time and time again that it is the last bastion of defence of civil liberties and human rights. On these issues in particular, this house has a legitimate right to question the excesses of any government. It has the right to vigorously scrutinise and revise legislation.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/27/tony-blair-resigns-as-middle-east-peace-envoy-report\">Tony Blair has announced he will step down next month as special representative of the quartet of the international powers seeking a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/27/alistair-carmichael-tavish-scott-scottish-lib-dems-sturgeon-memo\">Tavish Scott, the former Scottish Lib Dem leader, has said he feels let down by the behaviour of Alistair Carmichael, who admitted that he was responsible for a pre-election leak intended to damage Nicola Sturgeon.</a></strong><br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That’s all from us for today.

minister expected to leave controversial proposals out of Queen’s speech and announce wider consultation on British bill of rights","body":"<p>David Cameron will present plans for an EU referendum and Scottish devolution in his first Conservative Queen’s speech but is expected to delay controversial proposals to abolish the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The prime minister was facing criticism from some of his backbenchers, many in the judiciary, as well as Labour, the SNP and his former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, over the Tory manifesto pledge to replace human rights laws with a British bill of rights.</p> <p>It is now expected to be announced as a consultation rather than a draft law, as Cameron may not have the support to get it through the Commons with his wafer-thin majority of 12.</p> <p>Alex Salmond, the SNP MP and former first minister of Scotland, told the BBC it showed the government was in “headlong retreat” and that it “had not taken long to get blown off course”. </p> <p>But without commenting on the timing, Liz Truss, the Conservative environment secretary, insisted the plan was “absolutely” going be delivered at some point because it was a “clear manifesto pledge”.</p> <p>The centrepiece of the Queen’s speech will be Cameron’s law promising a referendum on Britain’s EU membership before the end of 2017, which was blocked by the Lib Dems in the coalition government. The wording of the question has not been finalised but the “yes” option is likely to be to stay part of the EU.</p> <p>Other key legislation includes:</p> <ul> <li>A five-year lock on tax rises including VAT, income tax and national insurance</li> <li>No income tax for those working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage</li> <li>The extension of right to buy to housing association tenants</li> <li>Further Scottish devolution and measures that will give English MPs more say over laws that only affect England</li> <li>A counter-extremism bill to tackle radicalisation</li> <li>A blanket ban on so-called legal highs</li> <li>An increase in free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week</li> <li>Reform of strike laws to require a higher turnout of union members</li> </ul> <p>Cameron said his legislative programme would mean “wherever you live, you can have the chance of a good education, a decent job, a home of your own and the peace of mind that comes from being able to raise a family and enjoy a secure retirement”.</p> <p>However, it is the omission of any proposed legislation to scrap the current human rights laws that will be the biggest surprise. The proposals will be on hold until Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has conducted a wider consultation.</p> <p>Although the government has an overall majority of 12 seats in the Commons, Cameron is massively outnumbered in the House of Lords, and his whips will have to be alert to any signs of rebellions by backbench MPs, possibly made restive by the prime minister’s promotion of an insufficiently ambitious EU renegotiation agenda.</p> <p>Ministers acknowledge that a conflict over the Human Rights Act may prove to be one of the most difficult politically, legally and intellectually for the Tories.</p> <p>In an attempt to rally his demoralised party, Clegg was due to attack Cameron for his approach to human rights in the Commons after the Queen’s speech. “The Liberal Democrats worked hard to ensure the coalition government’s agenda had a clear thread of liberalism running through it – from the priority we gave to mental health and the green agenda, to creating the pupil premium and protecting our civil liberties,” he said.</p> <p>“So it is dispiriting – if pretty unsurprising – to see how quickly, instead of building on those achievements, the new Conservative government is turning its back on that liberal stance. <a>The human rights we hold dear, our right to privacy in an online age, our future as an open-minded, outward-looking country, are all hanging in the balance again because of the measures being announced by the Conservative government.”</a></p> <p>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, had signalled his determination to make the Human Rights Act a central part of Labour opposition to the Queen’s speech if he was successful in his bid for the party leadership. He said he hoped Labour “throws the kitchen sink” at opposing the measures.</p>","linkText":"Cameron set to delay plans to scrap Human Rights

Tourist hordes and royal enthusiasts had better enjoy it while it lasts","body":"<p>Ah, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_from_the_throne\">Queen’s speech day</a> again. The streets between Buckingham Palace and the medieval royal palace across St James’s Park at Westminster have been tidied and, in some cases, closed to traffic. Canopies have been erected in case of republican rain, crush barriers put up to hold back London’s summer tourist hordes as the Queen’s fairy coach passes with that speech on her iPad.</p> <p> All this used to happen in wet November (Guy Fawkes, that 17th-century al-Qaida foot soldier planned to light the blue touchpaper on the 5 November), but changing legislative habits, spring elections and coalition imperatives have pushed it into glorious spring. Lucky tourists.</p> <p> But changing habits also reflect changing attitudes within the Queen’s own realm. How long can this elaborate, distinctly camp, feathered flummery continue if it no longer resonates with the wider public, anxious about job insecurity or indifferent to hollowed-out post-imperial pomp? I don’t claim to know the answer, but the question is worth asking.</p> <p> When Queen Victoria celebrated her <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/HistoryofJubilees/QueenVictoria.aspx\">diamond jubilee</a> in 1897, Britain still saw itself as the world’s leading power, though the writing was on the wall in both German and American. Taciturn George V was touched by public affection (“I didn’t know they cared”) during his silver jubilee in 1935, our own Queen got a good show of street parties in 1977, less so in soggy 2012.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>How many schoolchildren are ​​taught what today’s annual trip to parliament means in historical terms?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> But whenever it feels that the public romance with royalty – never remotely universal (republicanism surged during Victoria’s decades of mourning for bossy Albert) – is fading to the point of irrelevance, something happens to question secular and progressive assumptions.</p> <p> Princess Diana was adored, her not-so-effortless empathy (what do you do on meeting an Aids sufferer? You hug them) rightly admired, her private tragedy the stuff of operas not yet written. A global figure then, and one whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/31/tragedy-struck-nation-death-diana\">death</a> confirmed her myth. Her funeral in the same streets as today’s events was a brilliantly staged pageant (lovely weather again) with added, unscripted drama from her brother – and citizens of all ages and races who threw flowers on the hearse.</p> <p> Top that if you can, said the progressives in 2002, when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/30/queenmother.monarchy10\">Queen Mum</a> died at 101. But to their surprise, thousands filed past her coffin in Westminster Hall, much as they had for her husband 50 years earlier. It wasn’t a Diana moment, but it was decent and respectful. No one threw affectionate gin bottles at the cortege. Hadn’t the King and Queen <a href=\"http://www.annefrankguide.net/en-GB/bronnenbank.asp?aid=35657\">stayed in London during the Blitz</a> and their home been bombed too?</p> <p> Actually, they mostly slept at Windsor, but it was a shrewd display of solidarity, a nimble bit of footwork which the stuffy House of Windsor and its advisers continue to display when the royal back is against the wall. At 18, Princess Elizabeth joined the army, something Margaret Thatcher ducked at the same age.</p> <p> For a PR comeback, how about that 2002 “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_at_the_Palace\">party at the palace</a>”, eh ? Or Charlie Windsor’s handshake with sulphurous Gerry Adams? Even an old leftie like Alex Salmond feels the need to big up the passion for the turf he shares with Her Maj. There’s still something barely tangible there, mysterious, counterintuitive, even spiritual that means a lot to many people.</p> <p> And yet you can’t help feeling that the magnetic field of monarchy is weakening. How many schoolchildren are taught what today’s annual trip to parliament means in historical terms or why MPs troop off to the Lords? (monarchs have not been allowed in the Commons since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Members\">Charles I’s failed coup</a> there in 1641).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88f1cbe99eb5b84f83ba6003bb57e486ed603821\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/88f1cbe99eb5b84f83ba6003bb57e486ed603821/0_230_4148_2488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queen's speech in the House of Lords 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pomp and ceremony at the House of Lords last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Are the kids taught about the long struggle between monarch, aristocracy, church and people which – so the long-treasured Whig interpretation of progressive history had us believe – ended in the triumph of accountable popular democracy, the apolitical monarch merely the figurehead, the symbol of national unity: her government, courts and armed forces, if not her oligarchs and footloose Canary Wharf bankers?</p> <p> If people don’t understand the meaning behind the symbolism that justifies the feathers and ermine, the gold and the pomp, they will soon cease to tolerate it as an occasional irritant that holds up the traffic in central London. And the symbolism has been steadily hollowed out for decades.</p> <p> In our own time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/10/lords.uk\">Labour got rid of all but 92 hereditary peers</a> who sat in the Lords, a significant diminution of the old ruling and landed class which is fast retreating to its estates as it has done over most of old Europe, hanging on as best it can, successfully in some cases. </p> <p> Even a cut-price toff like David Cameron expediently modified the vestigial royal prerogative via the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011 \">Fixed Term Parliaments Act</a>, abolishing her symbolic power to dissolve parliament and trigger an election – nowadays he tells her, he doesn’t ask. Small stuff, but all part of the unwinding of the monarchical legacy of ages past. </p> <p>I noticed another manifestation when newly elected MPs turned up to swear the ritual oath of allegiance (and thereby qualify for salaries) the other day. Part of the ritual is that a Lords official called Black Rod (is it a job or something contagious?) arrives to summon them to the “other place” along the gilded corridors. Not even I can remember why. As Cameron led the frontbenchers I was struck by how few backbenchers, even Tories, joined him on the walk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>You can’t help feeling that the magnetic field of monarchy is weakening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> In the old days, Labour’s magnificently unclubbable Dennis Skinner would have stayed put, accompanied by a few pals from the Awkward Squad. Now it’s a bigger cross-party posse that includes most of the 56-member SNP contingent. Many MPs are privately republican (I suspect Ukip’s Douglas Carswell is one of them), just as many are atheist – another broken link with the state church and its head.</p> <p> A government with some spare time should stage a national conversation about this, perhaps as part of the wider constitutional review which Cameron has promised to modernise our flexible but improvised arrangements which have endured so long. Otherwise it will be done in haste in a crisis or botched for other reasons, perhaps after a miscalculated referendum on the very existence of the monarchy which many republicans would like to see when the Queen dies. Perhaps there will be a British compromise around a scaled-down royal family.</p> <p> “Dies”? Am I allowed to say that? As in most families, the unavoidable is usually deployed in euphemistic terms. But it will happen, though not before the doughty sovereign overtakes Queen Victoria to become our longest-reigning monarch. She has been shrewd, mostly silent and unshowy, dutiful and always dignified. </p> <p>So she will deserve and receive a good send-off, organised by the same Sir Alan FitzTightlys who have organised Wednesday’s pageant. Some men love an excuse for dressing up. But after that, who knows? I regard Britain as a crowned republic, one with a hereditary president, our collective staff, not our rulers.</p> <p> It seems to work well enough, at far lower cost than a subscription to Sky Sport. Others feel passionately that it is the keystone of privilege that must be torn down. A naive analysis, in my view, albeit keenly felt, especially among the progressive bourgeoisie. But the most insidious threat to clumsy Charlie Windsor’s lifelong mission to become Charles III is public indifference.</p> <p> So enjoy today’s OTT pomp if it rocks your boat. There may not be too many more. If David Attenborough ever has to deliver the President’s speech, I don’t think he’ll use that gold coach.</p>","linkText":"Queen's speech: how long can this feathered flummery continue?","lastModified":1432719088000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The ostentatious state opening of parliament scarcely resonates with a wider public anxious about job insecurity and indifferent to post-imperial pomp.

<span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/police-investigate-alistair-carmichaels-false-denials-over-memo-leak\">Police investigate Alistair Carmichael's false denials over memo leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sole Lib Dem MP in Scotland is under pressure from the Scottish National party over his role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/22/lib-dem-alistair-carmichael-admits-responsibility-anti-sturgeon-leak-mp-snp-leader-david-cameron\">leaking a confidential government document during the general election campaign</a> in an attempt to damage the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.</p> <p>Parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson has received a number of complaints about Carmichael’s conduct, and is considering whether to launch a formal investigation, her office said. </p> <p>Carmichael, the former Scottish secretary, is accused of having misled the public about his knowledge of a leak to the Daily Telegraph of an account of a meeting between Sturgeon and the French ambassador, alleging that Sturgeon said she would prefer David Cameron to Ed Miliband as prime minister. The SNP is demanding that Carmichael resign.</p> <p>After a Cabinet Office inquiry and report, Carmichael has apologised for his role in authorising the leak by his special adviser, but the SNP has asked the parliamentary inquiry standards commissioner in parliament to rule on his conduct.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I think people in public life are entitled to make a mistake and move on</p> <footer> <cite>Sir Malcolm Bruce</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Asked on BBC Radio 4 whether he was alleging that lying was widespread in public life, Bruce, who stood down at the election, replied: “No, well, yes. Lots of people have told lies and you know perfectly well that to be true.”</p> <p>He suggested MPs could not be excluded for telling a lie: “If you are suggesting every MP who has never quite told the truth or even told a brazen lie, including cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, we would clear out the House of Commons very fast, I would suggest,” he said.</p> <p> He said: “The SNP was in full hue and cry and it was an ugly sight … Alistair has recognised he has made a mistake he has apologised and I think people in public life are entitled to make a mistake and move on. He has foregone his severance pay. Carmichael had misconducted himself as a minister and he has apologised for that. That does not prejudge his capacity to be a first-class MP.”</p> <p>Carmichael has been under intense pressure not just for his role in the leak but for telling Channel 4 news after the leak that the first he knew of the matter was when it was reported in the Telegraph. </p> <p>But Bruce said Scotland needed diversity and plurality: “Scotland is a divided and bruised country with just one Liberal Democrat, one Conservative and Labour MP, and the SNP are quite clearly trying to extinguish all opposition in Scotland. That’s their objective and they will stop at nothing to do it – and their own record on mistakes and misleading of parliament does not bear close examination.” </p> <p>He then alleged the former Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, had misled parliament citing a bogus claim by Salmond that he had legal advice that an independent Scotland would remain a member of the EU, but then revealed no such advice existed. Salmond, Bruce pointed out, had not resigned or apologised for that claim. He added that Sturgeon had once appealed for understanding after she was accused of defending a benefit fraudster. </p> <p>Carmichael said he no longer believed Sturgeon told the French ambassador that she preferred Cameron, and therefore an account of the meeting set out in the leaked memo was an inaccurate description of what the ambassador reported Sturgeon saying to her.

He didn’t invent the claim, but he did maintain that he’d known nothing about it until a journalist told him. In fact, he had authorised a minion to get it published.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/sir-malcolm-bruce-house-of-commons-lying-mps\">Sir Malcolm Bruce: Commons would empty very fast if lying MPs had to quit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He can’t be sacked from the cabinet, since he’s no longer in it, but he accepts that such a demotion would have been justified – and he’s forfeited the severance payment which those who lose cabinet seats are routinely paid. But does that go far enough? The SNP say he should give up his seat – the only one the Lib Dems still hold in Scotland.</p> <p>Defending Carmichael’s right to stay put on BBC radio on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/sir-malcolm-bruce-house-of-commons-lying-mps\">his veteran Westminster colleague Malcolm Bruce was asked if lying was widespread in public life</a>; to which he produced the incisive reply: “No. Well, yes.”</p> <p>But asked if MPs should be sacked for telling lies, he said: “If you are suggesting every MP who has never quite told the truth or even told a brazen lie, including cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, we would clear out the House of Commons very fast.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/police-investigate-alistair-carmichaels-false-denials-over-memo-leak\">Police investigate Alistair Carmichael's false denials over memo leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That sounds like the kind of answer that brings politics into disrepute, but in fact it’s a pretty fair summary of what everyone knows about politicians and equally (sometimes more culpably: see recent City scandals) about public performers in general. The truth, as everyone in that area knows, is that there’s a sliding scale – degrees one might say of degradation, which range from the tiddler to the absolute whopper – and worse. If every lie told by politicians, especially those uttered in parliament, where the offence is taken most solemnly, was a hanging offence, you wouldn’t be able to move at Westminster for gibbets.</p> <p>Some dishonest parliamentary assertions amount to little more than white lies. A few degrees higher there are statements meant to be true when uttered but proven thereafter to be wholly unfounded: Nick Clegg’s stance on raising tuition fees; David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” pledge on cutting immigration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who’s been a political reporter understands the routine use of tactical lying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lurking somewhere in this territory too, as anyone knows who has looked at assessments by such trustworthy truth-tellers as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is the claim that since the coalition moved against the deficit, we’ve been “all in this together”.</p> <p>Anyone who’s been a political reporter understands the routine use of tactical lying: I’m not alone in having sat in the reporters’ gallery hearing myself denounced for having written a story “without foundation” by the very minister who – in a candid moment – let me in on a secret.</p> <p>Parliamentary conventions preclude an MP calling another a liar, though that rule has sometimes been flouted without rebuke – as when the Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant said in the house that Jeremy Hunt, then culture secretary, had lied to the house about his connections with the forces of Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>The term MPs more often resort to is one coined by Winston Churchill when he said that the term “slavery” could not be applied in a contentious issue without risking a “terminological inexactitude”. In fact, Churchill here was distinguishing such an “inexactitude” from a lie, in much the same way as the former cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, told an Australian court that in its handling of the Spycatcher case the government had been “economical with the truth”.</p> <p>The famously unfettered Conservative minister Alan Clark refashioned that formula later, putting it up a notch or two in the mendacity league by telling the Matrix Churchill hearing on arms sales to Iraq that in answering parliamentary questions he’d been “economical with the actualité” – an answer honest enough to cause the trial to collapse.</p> <p>There are not so many claims to a place in the highest echelons of political lying, where the case becomes a lasting scandal and breaks the politician who lied. The most famous case was that of John Profumo, who paid the supreme penalty not directly for his association with Christine Keeler but for lying to the house when he denied their connection.</p> <p>So do people in public life lie? Yes, copiously and consistently. And is Carmichael’s offence so high on the sliding scale that he deserves eviction? It certainly could be said that his lie was designed to shield him from the consequences of a breach of legitimate electoral processes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2\">1983 Representation of the People Act</a> rates it an offence to make false statements about a candidate. In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/21/phil-woolas-charges-false-election-statements\">Labour MP Phil Woolas was condemned by the election court for doing that</a>, and had to leave politics.</p> <p>The parallel here is not exact, since Woolas impugned his constituency opponent, whereas Carmichael condoned an enterprise designed to damage a whole political party. Yet if election candidates who impugned a whole political party – as happened with Carmichael – were required to stand down, there’d be hardly any left standing at the end of an election campaign.</p> <p>Sadly, bringing politics into disrepute, which is blamed for the irresistible rise of political disillusionment – and of which the belief that politicians are habitually lying is a basic ingredient – goes unpunished in too many ways to single out this case from the rest.</p>","linkText":"Do our MPs lie?

is being conducted under one member, one vote for first time, but analysis shows Ed Miliband would still have been elected in 2010 under this system","body":"<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/chuka-umunna-backs-liz-kendall-labour-leadership\">Chuka Umunna backs Liz Kendall for Labour leadership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour’s new system for electing its leader in which each vote is equally weighted could still see union members having a decisive influence on the outcome, a Guardian analysis has revealed.</p> <p>For the first time in the party’s history, the ballot is being conducted under the one-member-one-vote system. In 2010, by contrast, the votes of union members were guaranteed one-third of the electoral college that gave Ed Miliband victory over his brother David.</p> <p>However, if the votes cast in that bruising contest are recalculated using the new system, removing the union weighting, Ed Miliband would still have defeated his brother David on the final ballot by 175,400 to 147,100.</p> <p>The degree of the unions’ influence this time around will depend on three factors: the number of levy payers recruited as party supporters before the August deadline; whether the leaderships of the three main unions back the same candidate (as they did in 2010 with Ed Miliband); and whether those recommendations are as influential as they were in the 2010 race.</p> <p>About 220,000 party members are currently entitled to vote, but this number will be topped up by registered supporters who pay £3 before the 12 August deadline, plus any of the approximately 2.5 million union members who agree to register free of charge.</p> <p>In 2010’s final round, Ed Miliband won 119,405 individual votes in the union section, and David Miliband 80,266. In the party membership section, David, by contrast, beat his brother by 66,814 to to 55,992. The breadth of David’s support was striking since he topped the poll in every region of the party and in 540 constituencies. His brother topped the poll in just 73.</p> <h2>The numbers game</h2> <p>But it was the scale of the support for Ed Miliband in the union section that consigned David to defeat in 2010, and this would still be the case even if the election was rerun under the 2015 rules.</p> <p>It was reported at the weekend that unions are recruiting 1,000 members a day as party supporters. If this rate continues each working day until 12 August, they will have recruited only 60,000 members, roughly a third of the union members who voted in 2010. They may well be hoping to push this number higher – perhaps closer to the 200,000 valid union votes cast in 2010. Unite has already commissioned an external firm to call levy payers in order to boost this number.</p> <p>In 2010, 2.7m votes were distributed to Labour’s affiliated members, but turnout was 9%, or around 250,000. The low figure did not matter in 2010 since the unions were guaranteed a third of the vote in the electoral college, something that does not apply this time.</p> <p>The second critical factor is the decision of union leaderships on the party candidate to recommend to its membership. The 2010 election showed that the recommendation of union executives was highly influential on how members decided to vote.</p> <p>In 2010, the three big unions, GMB, Unite and Unison, represented three quarters of the union vote and all recommended Ed Miliband. In these three unions, Ed Miliband won an average of 45% of the first preference votes. A total of 196,750 first preference votes were cast by union members in all the unions that nominated a candidate, and 82,938 went for Ed Miliband.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bff58bb933e37d4cd13b8b551b284476cc930e9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432655847567/3c7a799d-800a-4a00-97a9-9d0fd9c2ea7b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is likely that Unite will back Andy Burnham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is likely that Unite will recommend Andy Burnham for leader, but the decision is not a foregone conclusion. Unite has an executive committee meeting starting on 8 June. Many leftwing activists are not enthused by any of the choices, but at the same time see the failure of the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition in the 2015 election as a sign of the futility of forming a splinter party on the left.</p> <p>The final factor is the degree to which unions can make their recommendation persuasive as they did in 2010. In that election, some of the importance of the recommendation flowed from the extent to which candidates not recommended by a union leadership found themselves “frozen out of a union” either by being excluded from union literature such as magazines, or by discovering the actual ballot paper was enclosed in an envelope making a recommendation for Ed Miliband.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, the interim leader, has promised to curtail these practices by ensuring the ballot paper is sent out by Electoral Reform Services. A new code states candidates will receive lists of all voters and the secretaries of constituency parties and affiliates on payment of £2,500, “subject to guidance on data protection and limitations on the number of contacts”. But it is still permissible, quite reasonably, for an executive to send out its literature in favour of their chosen candidate.</p> <h2>The war of perception</h2> <p>There is also a potential downside to being perceived as the union’s favoured candidate. Some members with long memories are still bruised by the fact they felt deprived of their true choice by the unions in 2010 and, if they feel Burnham is the creature of the unions, there will be a kick-back.</p> <p>Party members also above all want a winner and, if Burnham is being branded by the rightwing press as the unions’ poodle, they may think Burnham is hobbled, but if he performs strongly in the planned televised debates, that drag anchor will count for little. Burnham has taken the trouble of announcing he will not accept union cash in his campaign, although his rivals ask if this self-denying ordinance extends to unions working for him pro-bono.</p> <p>Liz Kendall, by contrast, is getting pretty favourable coverage, but she is taking a gamble that the party membership will embrace her undiluted change message. Her calculation may be that the experience of 1994 and 2010 shows the membership are more mainstream than some imagine. But Blair in 1994 and David Miliband in 2010 were the stand-out experienced candidates and Kendall is being asked to play in a bigger league than she has ever previously operated.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, should not be underestimated. Some of her opening statements have bordered on the bland and her slow start may reflect that her family is still recovering from her husband’s bruising defeat in the general election. <br /></p> <p>She is now starting to speed up and has some of the best party organisers working in her team. She has the ability, given the electoral system, to emerge as the compromise centrist candidate. So long as she comes second in the ballot, she can hope votes of the third-placed candidate transfer to her, and she can win. </p>","linkText":"Unions may still play decisive role in Labour leadership

Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states","body":"<p>The UK is a global leader in international development. Our work fighting poverty, disease, climate change and conflict embodies British values, and is also in our national interest. We are writing not about the domestic political implications of Britain’s membership of the EU, but about the international implications. In our view, EU membership is a practical way to extend our reach and multiply our influence. Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states. This larger pool delivers better lives for the poorest people. It also helps tackle problems in areas where the UK has no large presence, for example in the Sahel and parts of west Africa. EU aid complements activities that other aid agencies cannot undertake, like police and security missions in fragile hotspots. Cooperation within the EU will be essential to tackling the humanitarian emergency in Syria, the migration crisis, and the wider issues of peace, security and development in the Middle East and north Africa.</p><p>Beyond aid, partnership within the EU helped the UK achieve an ambitious outcome<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\"> at the climate talks in Paris</a>; and provides a platform for further work on trade, financial flows, corruption and human rights. In all these areas, the EU demonstrates the value of collective action on a global scale. Of course, there are things we want to change in the way the EU works. But British engagement raises standards and improves performance. In September last year, the UK and 192 other members of the UN signed up to the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">sustainable development goals</a>. These set the whole world, rich countries and poor, on a new path towards peace, prosperity, justice and sustainability. The values underlying the global goals are shared by the UK and embedded in EU treaties. Withdrawing from the EU would diminish the UK’s role in the world and set back our efforts to end global poverty.</p>","linkText":"Only inside the European Union can the UK help fight global poverty |

It it wasn’t for the European referendum, the argument about English junior doctors’ pay and conditions would be given the priority that it now requires","body":"<p>If Britain had its political priorities in order, the English junior hospital <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/doctors\" title=\"\">doctors’ dispute</a> would be the dominant domestic issue of the day – and would surely also have been solved by now. Contract talks started nearly four years ago and the dispute came to a head in the autumn, after the Conservatives were elected with <a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf\" title=\"\">a manifesto pledge</a> to introduce “a truly seven-day NHS”, but on terms the doctors opposed. It is now more than three months since the doctors voted by 98% for industrial action; there have been two short strikes, and now there will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/junior-doctors-announce-three-48-hour-strikes\" title=\"\">three more</a>, the first on 9 March. Meanwhile talks on the pay and working hours contract have broken down and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has moved to impose the deal, a decision that is&nbsp;being challenged in the courts.</p><p>As though that was not a serious enough breakdown in NHS relations, Mr Hunt was on Wednesday embroiled in an emotive argument <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35597243\" title=\"\">about numbers</a> which reflected wider lack of trust. Last summer, he said the failure to provide a full seven-day service was responsible for about 6,000 extra deaths a year in England. It now seems that Mr Hunt got the figure two months before the academic study from which it was drawn was published and that officials also blurred the source from which the figure came.

It’s less about Little Britain or Brussels bureaucrats than curious haircuts and cravats. Tory London mayor candidate Zac Goldsmith does not conform to that disabling stereotype, being always attired with subtle elegance and only sometimes doing his listening with one hand jammed into a jacket side pocket, that timeless patrician giveaway. But his decision to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35625097\">campaign for Brexit</a> plants him on the same stage as the sort of person who sports unionist cuff links and wears vanity hats. His Labour rival Sadiq Khan <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/zac-goldsmith-and-sadiq-khan-go-to-war-over-brexit-a3187961.html\">smells an opportunity</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, Khan appeared on Newsnight. He has his own sartorial act nicely worked out - dark suit, white shirt, no tie, crisp but nothing flash - and a mission to depict Goldsmith as a cossetted dilettante <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/13/nicholas-soames-conservative-party-europe-ukip_n_5318391.html\">eccentric</a>. This has been happening for some time, but Khan sees the EU referendum as handing him a bit more ammunition. Asked if he could sit comfortably next to the Barclays CEO on a trade delegation to Shanghai, he said of course he could. And: “By the way, I will join the Conservative chancellor when it’s in the interests of London and I will join a Conservative prime minister to argue for staying in the European union.”</p>","linkText":"London mayor race: Khan plays Cameron EU card in bid to squeeze Goldsmith","lastModified":1456383483630,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>His Tory rival’s Eurosceptic stance has

I’ll read the prime minster what the researchers themselves say - ‘it is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable, to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading’. So are you and your health secretary being rash and misleading with these figures?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his reply, Cameron said it was the BMA that had been misleading, because it had publishing inaccurate information about the pay deal for junior doctors. And he defended Hunt, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now let me answer, very directly, the question about excess deaths. The 6,000 figure for excess deaths was based on a question asked by the health secretary to Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS. Now we have had time to go into these figures in more detail, I can tell you this - that the health secretary was indeed guilty. He was guilty of an understatement. The true figures for excess deaths at the weekend are 11,000, not 6,000, so perhaps you will now withdraw your totally unjustified attack on the health secretary?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Cameron ignored the point Corbyn was making, which is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/jeremy-hunt-criticised-for-misrepresenting-nhs-weekend-mortality-facts-a6703301.html\">that the researchers who produced the 11,000 figure said it would be misleading to suggest those deaths were caused by low staffing levels at weekends.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has sacked Suzanne Evans as a party deputy chair. </strong>He said he was moving Evans and Neil Hamilton, another deputy chair, because they were both candidates in the May elections.

(My bold text.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <ul> \n    <li>The renegotiation package is based on an international agreement which is binding in international law (which means it lacks the enforcement mechanisms of EU or domestic law). Any such agreement must conform to EU law. To the extent it does not EU law prevails.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>The international agreement is “irreversible” in the sense that it can only be repealed or amended by common accord of the parties, <strong>but that does not have the effect of removing the legal uncertainties highlighted by this note </strong>i.e. there is no legal guarantee that the Decision will produce all the results envisaged.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>This international law agreement does not purport to change the Treaties, only clarify or supplement them. Any such clarifications of the Treaties, and the consistency with the Treaties of supplemental agreements, are subject to the view of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) because it is the ultimate interpreter of the Treaties.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>There are two areas where Treaty change is envisaged, in each case to “upgrade” clarifications to Treaty level. Any such upgrade limits the scope for the Court of Justice to give an adverse judgment.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Both areas of future Treaty change lack detail and urgency; and are in any event conditional, as they must be, on the approval/ratification of the Member States. This makes any future Treaty change vulnerable to a change in government or an adverse referendum result in another Member State.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Critical EU secondary legislation envisaged by the package is subject to agreement by the European Parliament which is not bound by the international law agreement and has made no declaration of its intentions (although it has been involved in the negotiations and European Parliament Groups have made positive statements).</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>It is questionable how much effect the red card will make in practice. </li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>The emergency brake in respect of the Eurozone is not a veto.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <ul> \n    <li>The emergency brake in respect of free movement applies only to in work benefits and relies on agreement by the Commission (effectively given for this first time by a Declaration) and the Council (which is also likely on this first occasion).</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee has also published<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/european-scrutiny-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/eu-membership-follow-up-15-16/publications/\"> other legal advice it has received on this issue.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-24T16:43:35.370Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>","linkText":"Donald Tusk: EU deal is 'legally binding and irreversible' -

Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states","body":"<p>The UK is a global leader in international development. Our work fighting poverty, disease, climate change and conflict embodies British values, and is also in our national interest. We are writing not about the domestic political implications of Britain’s membership of the EU, but about the international implications. In our view, EU membership is a practical way to extend our reach and multiply our influence. Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states. This larger pool delivers better lives for the poorest people. It also helps tackle problems in areas where the UK has no large presence, for example in the Sahel and parts of west Africa. EU aid complements activities that other aid agencies cannot undertake, like police and security missions in fragile hotspots. Cooperation within the EU will be essential to tackling the humanitarian emergency in Syria, the migration crisis, and the wider issues of peace, security and development in the Middle East and north Africa.</p><p>Beyond aid, partnership within the EU helped the UK achieve an ambitious outcome<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\"> at the climate talks in Paris</a>; and provides a platform for further work on trade, financial flows, corruption and human rights. In all these areas, the EU demonstrates the value of collective action on a global scale. Of course, there are things we want to change in the way the EU works. But British engagement raises standards and improves performance. In September last year, the UK and 192 other members of the UN signed up to the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">sustainable development goals</a>. These set the whole world, rich countries and poor, on a new path towards peace, prosperity, justice and sustainability. The values underlying the global goals are shared by the UK and embedded in EU treaties. Withdrawing from the EU would diminish the UK’s role in the world and set back our efforts to end global poverty.</p>","linkText":"Only inside the European Union can the UK help fight global poverty |
