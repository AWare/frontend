As soon as the Stone Roses’ 1990 bank holiday show was announced, everyone agreed that it already sounded legendary. In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Now the Nottingham rapper immortalised in the Shane Meadows film is back with his first album, Aeon","body":"<p>“I was a chubby white kid who wasn’t very cool at school,” says <a href=\"http://www.scorzilla.com/aeon-peace-to-the-puzzle/\">Scor-zay-zee</a>. “I took up rapping because I wanted to be cool.” For one fleeting moment in 2004, the underground Nottingham rapper became exactly that: the most talked-about man in music. His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1448461571000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

When he made his first forays into composition, the results were more Astral Weeks than Waiting for An Alibi: on early songs such as Dublin, Saga of the Ageing Orphan, Remembering and Shades of a Blue Orphanage, he reimagined his home city with the same impressionistic nostalgia Van Morrison used to conjure up postwar Belfast. Thin Lizzy were formed in 1970 by Lynott, former Them guitarist Eric Bell and ex-Black Eagle drummer Brian Downey, and released their patchy debut in April 1971. Originally written as a poem, Dublin was released a few months later on the New Day EP. Long before Lynott thought to use mythic Celtic imagery as a monolithic form of band branding, the song suggests a more conflicted relationship with Ireland. Themes of lost love, entrapment and exile are set to a gorgeously faltering melody and the gentle susurrations of acoustic guitar punctuated by eloquent electric counterpoints. Rooted in Lynott’s fascination with the folk and poetry scenes of 60s Dublin, this beautiful, disarming ballad suggests he could easily have followed an entirely different career trajectory. </p>","linkText":"Thin Lizzy – 10 of the best","lastModified":1455710638000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Frontman Phil Lynott’s biographer charts the band’s rapid progress from melodic heartfelt ballads to raw, thunderous rock’n’roll</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gn2e","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/metal","url":"/music/metal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Metal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/graemethomson","url":"/profile/graemethomson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Graeme Thomson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemethomson","bio":"<p>Graeme Thomson has written for Esquire, MOJO, Maxim, Rolling Stone, Time Out and is a regular contributor to The Word and the Observer Music Monthly.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/15/new-band-the-drums\">Drums</a>. Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel. According to his forthcoming single - We Try But We Don’t Fit In - isolation is getting to him: he has even got a song, Nothing at All, that finds him moaning “What am I good for?”, answering himself: “Nothing at all”.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","linkText":"The playlist: new bands – Day Wave, Boycrush, Rangleklods and more","lastModified":1432566679000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Lo-fi synth angst from Day Wave, Sunflower Bean hear voices, and Boycrush ft Madeira wreak lovely, summery electro fluff </p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497g4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/indie","url":"/music/indie","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/paullester","url":"/profile/paullester","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Paul Lester","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paullester","bio":"<p>Paul Lester been contributing to the Guardian for most of this century.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br /></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p>","linkText":"Summer jams: Guardian critics pick the songs that will soundtrack your holidays","lastModified":1432318379558,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>As the perennial debate begins over which songs will own the summer, our critics chime in with their favourites – and find mobile phones, yoga and polyamorous relationships are the big themes this year</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494kh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/nicki-minaj","url":"/music/nicki-minaj","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Nicki Minaj","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/janelle-monae","url":"/music/janelle-monae","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janelle Monae","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/david-guetta","url":"/music/david-guetta","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"David Guetta","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/rob-le-donne","url":"/profile/rob-le-donne","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Rob LeDonne","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-le-donne","twitterHandle":"robledonne","bio":"<p>Rob LeDonne is a freelance journalist and comedy writer.</p>","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-hutchinson","url":"/profile/kate-hutchinson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Hutchinson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","twitterHandle":"katehutchinson","bio":"<p>Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432420063000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Within a few months of moving here, a friend and I set up a record label – <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.howlingowlrecords.com/\">Howling Owl </a>– and now, the thing that keeps us motivated is the perpetual flow of new music and sense of risk. It’s a place where progression is key and genres and “scenes” happily splice with one another, creating beautiful hybrids that get discovered five years later – by which time the next future has already been cut on to a dub-plate. I’m not going to gush about the city as there are enough sponsored “best places to live in the UK” polls driving the house prices up already, but it is one hell of an audiovisual treat.<br

I sometimes feel like we have that,” Rachel Zeffira, one half of Cat’s Eyes says of her relationship with the other half, Faris Badwan. It’s a creative bond that has so far culminated in their critically acclaimed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/07/cats-eyes-review\">self-titled 2011 debut</a>, as well as the lauded soundtrack for Peter Strickland’s film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/duke-of-burgundy-review-toronto-film-festival\">The Duke of Burgundy</a>; both seeped in sophisticated, strange orchestrations. Two minds, it seems, is better than one. </p><p>In 2016, however, the duo return with the release of their second album proper, Treasure House, released on 3 June and produced and mixed by Steve Osborne (New Order, Suede, Happy Mondays). Its leading single, <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/treasurehousedl\">Chameleon Queen</a>, illuminates the degradation of love using the regality of a poised neoclassical ballad. With Zeffira’s ghostly soprano filling the background, Badwan takes centre stage as the despondent ex-lover. “When I think of what you did, of all you hid,” he sings with an eerie contentedness, “I just don’t care about you anymore.”</p>","linkText":"Listen to Cat's Eyes' Chameleon Queen","lastModified":1454425997000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Lead single from second album Treasure House is a

Armenian-American virtuoso <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP66Sw7Q1so\">Sergei Babayan</a>, have recently established themselves as fine exponents of the repertory for two pianos, and their Wigmore concert, part of <a href=\"http://wigmore-hall.org.uk/artistic-series/daniil-trifonov-residency\">Trifonov’s current residency</a>, was a beguiling affair that combined formidable technique with musicianship of great elegance. Their platform partnership is clearly founded on deep mutual understanding and respect. Babayan beamed with almost avuncular warmth on his star pupil throughout. Trifonov, his platform manner gauchely un-showy, seemed on occasion to be touchingly in awe of his mentor.</p><p>Their playing blends rigour with great charm and an almost tangible sense of their own enjoyment: Babayan could sometimes be heard humming along to the music, contentedly, if on occasion distractingly. Schumann’s Andante and Variations, however, showed their stylistic unity from the outset. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO5fLLHj55k\">Schubert’s great Fantaisie in F minor</a>, originally written for piano duet, was done with great sensitivity and depth of feeling, its opening melody shuttled between them with wonderful refinement. A group of Brahms’s Hungarian Dances brought the first half to a close in a blaze of joyous bravado.</p>","linkText":"Trifonov/Babayan review – formidable technique and musicianship of great elegance","lastModified":1455660046022,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br>Star pupil and mentor romped through piano duets in a show of breathtaking music on a knife-edge</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gmv2","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

freighting it with extra material so as to generate more laughs seems unnecessary. In <a href=\"http://www.wno.org.uk\">Welsh National Opera</a>’s new production, director <a href=\"http://www.verysambrown.moonfruit.com/about-news/4578794086\">Sam Brown</a>’s interventions and <a href=\"http://kelleyrourke.com\">Kelley Rourke</a>’s translation make the opera seem heavy going. For this spring season, under the heading Figaro Forever, artistic director David Pountney is updating Beaumarchais’s celebrated trilogy, following the Barber and Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro with the premiere of <a href=\"https://www.wno.org.uk/divorce\">Elena Langer’s Figaro Gets a Divorce</a>. The theme is justified, but this is a dismal opener.</p><p>Featuring <a href=\"http://ralphkoltai.com\">Ralph Koltai</a>’s striking sets, this staging shows no shortage of colour – the traditional barber’s pole stripes are emblazoned on jackets and waistcoats. There is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python\">Monty Python</a> moment when the male chorus returns for the first act finale in wigs and flowery overalls, looking like Terry Jones and Graham Chapman’s women planning to go and see Jean-Paul Sartre.</p>","linkText":"The Barber of Seville review – colourful but

La Commedia, Andriessen’s most recent stage work (a new one will be premiered at the Holland festival in June), is a typically wide-ranging and culturally allusive riff on Dante’s Divine Comedy. The piece, like its predecessors, blurs the boundary between concert hall and opera house: sometimes it resembles a series of dramatic tableaux, other times it’s more like a collection of secular cantatas.</p><p>Whatever the designation, it was a joyous, uplifting experience. The Barbican performance, conducted with wonderful clarity by <a href=\"http:// http://intermusica.co.uk/artist/Martyn-Brabbins\" title=\"\">Martyn Brabbins</a>, was a concert staging. Directed by Kenneth Richardson, it dispensed with the film by Hal Hartley that was shot for the 2008 Amsterdam stage premiere and which was also packaged with the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/mfofo8q\" title=\"\">CD version</a> two years ago. That allowed Andriessen’s magpie-like score, ransacking three centuries of musical history, to be relished fully, and we could grasp the texts in three languages more easily. As in the Amsterdam premiere, the soprano Claron McFadden was Beatrice, and the mezzo Cristina Zavalloni performed Dante; the Lucifer here was baritone Andrew Sauvageau, while Synergy Vocals supplied the chorus and the Finchley Children’s Music Group delivered the charmingly mocking coda.</p>","linkText":"Total Immersion: Andriessen review – a joyous, uplifting

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/14/philharmonia-hrusa-review-suk-praga\">Czech repertory</a>. He has now turned to Mahler for a performance of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._3_(Mahler)\">Third Symphony</a> with the Philharmonia that began with moments of uncertainty but grew in stature and force as it progressed.</p><p>Attempting a comprehensive depiction of the cosmos as a metaphysical chain of being that progresses from raw matter to the purity of spiritual love, this is arguably the most ambitious of the composer’s symphonies and the most difficult to realise. The immense first movement pushes at the boundaries of coherence, and Hrůša revealed that as yet, he has not quite mastered it. The opening was superbly done, the sullen brass and rumbling low woodwind eerily suggesting some primal force in the process of germination. Thereafter, as life heaves into being, things felt a bit over-controlled: speeds were at times exaggerated; the music’s grandeur was occasionally emphasised at the expense of its Dionysiac fire.</p>","linkText":"Philharmonia/Hruša review – ravishing textures and self-conscious languor","lastModified":1455279680000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London<br></strong>Mahler’s metaphysical Third Symphony is arguably his most ambitious and Jakub Hrůša’s reading was remarkable</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjpk","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/philharmonia-orchestra","url":"/music/philharmonia-orchestra","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The Philharmonia Orchestra","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/philharmonia-orchestra","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

\n</aside><p>When the soundtrack to Empire entered the US charts at No 1 in March, no one could have been particularly surprised, with one possible exception: Madonna, who unexpectedly found herself debuting at No 2. All that effort promoting your new album – the interviews, the online courting of controversy, unceremoniously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/madonna-falls-but-it-was-the-brit-awards-that-took-a-tumble\">falling on your arse at the Brits</a> – and you’re pipped at the post by one of the oldest tricks in the book, the one that Micky Dolenz of the Monkees famously described as “the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan”. It’s almost 60 years since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvUGi0xBm84\">Ricky Nelson performed Fats Domino’s I’m Walkin’</a> on his parents’ sitcom and ended up a real-life pop star, but launching a musical career by pretending to have a musical career on a TV show still seems to work like a dream. It’s not just that the soundtrack album of Empire – a soapy musical drama about a feuding family and their urban entertainment company that’s swiftly become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">one of the biggest TV shows in the US</a> – was successful: two members of the cast now have major-label deals in their own right.

This time around, they’ve gone one step more primitive. Armed with acoustic instruments, the prolific indie trio – fronted by Jonathan Richman acolyte Dave Tattersall – convened in an east London studio and shared one microphone. No mixing, no nothing; the record is vinyl-only. But the Wave Pictures are not knock-kneed DIY amateurs. A blues-like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERHQutaf84E\" title=\"\">Memphis Slim in Paris</a> – or the elegantly dour ballad The Pharmacy Cross – are fully realised songs, with wide-ranging references.

a member of a punk band, Marlon Williams was never going to make a conventional country-rock LP. Sure enough, the New Zealander’s solo debut is part Jeff Buckley, part early rock’n’roll, as underlined by his cover of a Billy Fury song (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrBH_kTac5A\" title=\"\">I’m Lost Without You</a>). Williams’s voice is shown off best on another cover, the folk standard When I Was a Young Girl, every second of which rings true. And while he doesn’t know quite where his strengths lie yet, tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jnm7gUIYjA\" title=\"\">Strange Things</a> and <a

In 1976, he was co-starring with Getz’s quartet at Keystone Korner, a San Francisco jazz club, and the CD was compiled from recordings made during their week-long run. Appearances by the perfectionist, semi-reclusive Gilberto were rare, and there’s an atmosphere of occasion about the silence into which he half-whispers the Portuguese lyrics, accompanied by his minimalist but infinitely subtle guitar. Even Getz’s gorgeous tenor saxophone, when he joins in, sounds strident by comparison. The original 1964 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/feb/01/artsfeatures.jazz\" title=\"\"><em>Getz/Gilberto</em></a> album is a masterpiece, and this never reaches those heights, but there’s something spellbinding about Gilberto’s intensity when facing a live audience, close-up.</p>","linkText":"João Gilberto: Getz/Gilberto '76 review – live, minimalist and

Given early support by Liszt, Ja&euml;ll faced many struggles as a female composer-pianist and ended her days a recluse and pedagogue. The kinds of terms used to describe her have included “barbaric”, ”headstrong”, “excessive” and “with a tendency towards mysticism”. These three discs sample her attractive, virtuosic concertos and piano works, performed by various artists. The Douze Valses et Finale for four hands are charming and quirky. The <em>Ce qu’on entend</em> series, progressing from hell to purgatory and paradise, for solo piano (David Bismuth), have far more individuality.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I27ouM_Ka6E\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I27ouM_Ka6E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch a trailer for the CD and book.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Marie Jaëll: Symphonic and Piano Music CD review – a neglected Romantic composer","lastModified":1455435912000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"Soloists, Brussels Philharmonic/Niquet, Orchestre national de Lille/Swensen<br />(Palazzetto Bru Zane) (3 CDs)","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ggea","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/fiona-maddocks","url":"/profile/fiona-maddocks","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Fiona Maddocks","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-maddocks","twitterHandle":"FionaMaddocks","bio":"<p>Fiona Maddocks is the Observer's classical critic.

That both bands are again battling for world tour supremacy is nothing new, but despite any similarities, the driving motivation behind each of these tours is remarkably different.</p>","linkText":"U2 and the Rolling Stones: rock giants hit the road but take different paths","lastModified":1432420064000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>While the Stones are happy to trade on a back catalogue largely compiled 40 years ago, the Irish rockers are pushing new material to prove their relevance</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496tx","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/u2","url":"/music/u2","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"U2","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/u2","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/therollingstones","url":"/music/therollingstones","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The Rolling Stones","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/therollingstones","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/scott-christian","url":"/profile/scott-christian","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Scott Christian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-christian","bio":"<p>Scott Christian is a culture and lifestyle writer whose work has appeared in Esquire, GQ, Mashable and Glamour.

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432420063000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of

mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

These range from better school attendance to projected whole-life benefits for participants, such as greater community cohesion as well as economic gains over the medium and longer term. The high initial cost of delivering the scheme should be offset by the savings that are projected to accrue from longer-term improved health and educational outcomes. </p><p>It’s a tribute to Sistema Scotland’s political, as well as social, reach that the report’s findings are endorsed by Scotland’s culture minister Fiona Hyslop, who supports its “potential to transform lives and tackle

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guYmOVMphqE\">Dublin</a></h2><p>During his apprenticeship as the singer in Dublin bands the Black Eagles, Skid Row and Orphanage, Philip Lynott almost exclusively sang other people’s material. When he made his first forays into composition, the results were more Astral Weeks than Waiting for An Alibi: on early songs such as Dublin, Saga of the Ageing Orphan, Remembering and Shades of a Blue Orphanage, he reimagined his home city with the same impressionistic nostalgia Van Morrison used to conjure up postwar Belfast. Thin Lizzy were formed in 1970 by Lynott, former Them guitarist Eric Bell and ex-Black Eagle drummer Brian Downey, and released their patchy debut in April 1971. Originally written as a poem, Dublin was released a few months later on the New Day EP. Long before Lynott thought to use mythic Celtic imagery as a monolithic form of band branding, the song suggests a more conflicted relationship with Ireland. Themes of lost love, entrapment and exile are set to a gorgeously faltering melody and the gentle susurrations of acoustic guitar punctuated by eloquent electric counterpoints. Rooted in Lynott’s fascination with the folk and poetry scenes of 60s Dublin, this beautiful, disarming ballad suggests he could easily have followed an entirely different career trajectory. </p>","linkText":"Thin Lizzy – 10 of the best","lastModified":1455710638000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Frontman Phil Lynott’s biographer charts the band’s rapid progress from melodic heartfelt ballads to raw, thunderous rock’n’roll</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gn2e","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/metal","url":"/music/metal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Metal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/graemethomson","url":"/profile/graemethomson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Graeme Thomson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemethomson","bio":"<p>Graeme Thomson has written for Esquire, MOJO, Maxim, Rolling Stone, Time Out and is a regular contributor to The Word and the Observer Music Monthly.

has proffered hard-won wisdom to girls and boys for four decades, but beware: Wright can administer a scolding along with tissues and gin","body":"<p>Betty Wright was a little late for the 60s heyday of Motown, Stax and Atlantic, but she wasted no time catching up. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_First_Time_Around\">Her first album</a> was released in 1968, when she was only 14; she had her first pop hit when she was 17; she earned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-2_kdVcyA\">her first gold record</a> when she was barely 18 – all despite coming from a religious family that refused to allow anything other than gospel to be played at home. Looking back on her childhood <a href=\"http://www.soulandjazzandfunk.com/interviews/1829-still-on-the-wright-path-veteran-soul-diva-betty-wright-speaks-to-sjf.html?showall=1\">in an interview in 2012</a>, she said she managed to persuade her mother to bless her nascent pop career by also being an A student who “did all the right things in school”, as if being musically precocious wasn’t enough of an achievement.</p><p>In those early records, there’s an amusing disjunction between Wright the youthful singer and the put-upon female characters she portrays. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baga1JRLY50\">Babysitter</a> – one of the first songs she wrote herself – a woebegone mother warns women not to trust any “16-year-old schoolgirl” around their husbands, and it sounds perfectly reasonable until you remember that Wright herself was still in her teens. She is the queen of the cautionary tale and practically an agony aunt when it comes to dispensing relationship advice, but she should be approached with caution unless you want a scolding administered along with tissues and gin. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IogtTA56Tog\">Secretary</a> is clear on whose fault it is if a man has a work affair: the secretary “takes the time to listen / To what he has to say / While all you do is nag him / A thousand times a day.” </p>","linkText":"Cult heroes: Betty Wright – soul's golden agony

Better Call Saul and The X-Files are back.

I even watched the first 30 minutes of WWE Monday Night Raw, the venerable pro-wrestling show that prominently features shouting as a major dramatic selling point. Did I mention there will also be literal fireworks? That’s far more entertainment value than this year’s Grammy awards offered, and yet I watched the damn thing anyway. </p>","linkText":"The grudge-match Grammys: why music awards should copy pro wrestling","lastModified":1455639380810,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The real interest in music awards shows is not in the winners – it’s in the prospect of stars such as Taylor Swift and Kanye West fighting.

At last reference books can be kept up-to-date, and this concise version of my previous opera guides contains state-of-the-art information on the 100 composers whose operas are most often performed, along with 250 operas that are their best works. Starting with Monteverdi and Cavalli, it ranges all through the repertoire to Peter Maxwell Davies, Kaija Saariaho and Thomas Ad&egrave;s, who have all written new operatic works to be premiered this year.</p><p>I first realised the need for such a book in the early 80s. There was, then, Kobb&eacute;’s Complete Opera Book of 1976, with 109 composers, but Britten’s Death in Venice was as far as it went; but no one had yet covered Birtwistle or Maxwell Davies, who were writing operas, let alone Philip Glass who had written eight stage works by 1985. I wanted to know about a lot more and, with several brilliant advisers, set about commissioning specialist writers to cover hundreds more opera composers. Penguin published four editions between 1993 and 2005 - both The Viking Opera Guide and the New Penguin Opera Guide contained 850 composers. But now there are more to add and it’s startling to see how quickly the opera world has changed, which composers (according to <a href=\"http://operabase.com/visual.cgi?lang=en&amp;splash=t\">Operabase</a>) are most popular and which no longer are. </p>","linkText":"Opera's new voices: 10 composers making overtures to greatness","lastModified":1455639843000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Opera Guide – just updated in a new digital edition – features the world’s 100 most performed composers.

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-&quot;Fame&quot; David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called &quot;ambient&quot; – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1452445457000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","linkText":"Joy Williams: What got me through the Civil Wars breakup?

I’m having a late start, because I had a meeting last night with Chuck Lorre, the creator of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/25/two-and-a-half-men-sheen-charlie\">Two and a Half Men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a>. We’re trying to make a musical out of Painted From Memory, the album I did with Elvis Costello. Elvis and I wrote eight new songs.

I thought songs were so simple that I could do five of them a day, but songs that sound simple are deceptive. It’s a very complicated process.

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240053,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

It was received with almost universal rapture, and comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush\">Kate Bush</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/laurie-anderson\">Laurie Anderson</a> and Nico flooded in. Music blogs dedicated themselves to decoding the enigmatic lyrics and cryptic allusions. The album was ubiquitous in critics’ end-of-year lists: it was chosen as the best album of 2015 by <em>Mojo</em> and <em>Uncut</em>, and in the top five by the <em>Guardian,</em> the<em> Sunday Times, Loud and Quiet</em>, <em>Q</em> and the <em>Wire</em>.</p><p>Yet, Julia Holter says, her life has not changed “at all”. She doesn’t get stopped for autographs. “No one recognises me on the street ever,” she says. “Maybe once or twice in my entire life, if at all. I think people have an idea that if you have a record out you’re famous.” Ask a roomful of critics what they think of Julia Holter and you’ll be submerged in breathless adoration; ask a random person in the street and you’re likely to get a blank stare. This suits her perfectly well. “I prefer this; I’m happy that way. You can have an internet presence but it doesn’t mean anyone has any idea who you are or what you look like. Which is great.”</p>","linkText":"Julia Holter: ‘I tend to feel like everything I’m doing is crazy’","lastModified":1455442214000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"The singer-songwriter’s dazzling 2015 album Have You in My Wilderness was a fixture in end-of-year lists.

But which two acts were they?</p>\n <p>Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler</p>\n <p>Fields of the Nephilim and Gene Loves Jezebel</p>\n <p>Starship and Uriah Heap</p>\n <p>The Wonderstuff and the Lucy Show</p>\n <p>2 In 1983, one rock act took to the stage with a model of Stonehenge. Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Sp&iuml;nal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>&pound;30</p>\n <p>&pound;175</p>\n <p>&pound;1,500</p>\n <p>&pound;3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times. But which band has he never appeared at the festival as a member of?</p>\n <p>Them Crooked Vultures</p>\n <p>Nirvana</p>\n <p>Queens of the Stone Age</p>\n <p>Foo Fighters</p>\n <p>10 After the Leeds leg of the festival moved from Temple Newsam to Bramham Park, the owner of the Bramham estate said the extra revenue would enable him to undertake renovations and improvements. Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work? Clearly”), the next he’s revealing his passion for picking wild flowers.

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1448461550000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

depending on your point of view; Pitbull recreated Benny Hill with Sofia Vergara and Taylor Swift put Kanye in his place. Lamar didn’t completely clean up either, beaten by the twin pop powers of Taylor Swift and Mark Ronson. </p> \n  <p>Here’s a snippet from our wrap:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Taylor Swift’s 1989 took the album of the year awards at the 58th Grammy awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Monday night. Having opened the show with a version of her hit Out of the Woods, the singer made a defiant acceptance speech which seemed to allude to her argument with Kanye West earlier in the week. The rapper’s new song Famous, referring to Swift, claims: “I made that bitch famous.”</p> \n   <p>Swift pointed out in her speech that she is the first woman to win album of the year twice and added: “I want to say to all the young women out there –there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Thanks so much for your comments and tweets and see you next year for more performances from Adele.

Better Call Saul and The X-Files are back.

I even watched the first 30 minutes of WWE Monday Night Raw, the venerable pro-wrestling show that prominently features shouting as a major dramatic selling point. Did I mention there will also be literal fireworks? That’s far more entertainment value than this year’s Grammy awards offered, and yet I watched the damn thing anyway. </p>","linkText":"The grudge-match Grammys: why music awards should copy pro wrestling","lastModified":1455639380810,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The real interest in music awards shows is not in the winners – it’s in the prospect of stars such as Taylor Swift and Kanye West fighting.

When he made his first forays into composition, the results were more Astral Weeks than Waiting for An Alibi: on early songs such as Dublin, Saga of the Ageing Orphan, Remembering and Shades of a Blue Orphanage, he reimagined his home city with the same impressionistic nostalgia Van Morrison used to conjure up postwar Belfast. Thin Lizzy were formed in 1970 by Lynott, former Them guitarist Eric Bell and ex-Black Eagle drummer Brian Downey, and released their patchy debut in April 1971. Originally written as a poem, Dublin was released a few months later on the New Day EP. Long before Lynott thought to use mythic Celtic imagery as a monolithic form of band branding, the song suggests a more conflicted relationship with Ireland. Themes of lost love, entrapment and exile are set to a gorgeously faltering melody and the gentle susurrations of acoustic guitar punctuated by eloquent electric counterpoints. Rooted in Lynott’s fascination with the folk and poetry scenes of 60s Dublin, this beautiful, disarming ballad suggests he could easily have followed an entirely different career trajectory. </p>","linkText":"Thin Lizzy – 10 of the best","lastModified":1455710638000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Frontman Phil Lynott’s biographer charts the band’s rapid progress from melodic heartfelt ballads to raw, thunderous rock’n’roll</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gn2e","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/metal","url":"/music/metal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Metal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/graemethomson","url":"/profile/graemethomson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Graeme Thomson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemethomson","bio":"<p>Graeme Thomson has written for Esquire, MOJO, Maxim, Rolling Stone, Time Out and is a regular contributor to The Word and the Observer Music Monthly.
