I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p><p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, 'That's a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.' Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p><p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p><p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: 'What's that?' 'Just hold it in your hand,' I said, 'and all the journalists next week will be saying you've got the whole world in your hand.' And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p><p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p><p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p><p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p><p>Adamski goes to number one with 'Killer' on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p><p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p><p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during 'Like a Virgin' on her 'Blond Ambition' tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p><p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p><p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon's offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads 'Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick', in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-27T08:55:48Z","standfirst":"The Stone Roses' tour manager Steve Adge recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes<br

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-01T15:21:35.000+01:00","standfirst":"<strong>Electric Ballroom, London</strong><br />The feminist punk legend makes a long-awaited return to the UK with her stage banter intact and a set of songs that make you want to trampoline","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499by","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734676066/The-Julie-Ruin.-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456925817","starRating":"4","byline":"Maddy Costa","internalPageCode":"2309790","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-06-27T14:45:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/punk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Punk","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/punk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/punk","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tone/livereview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/livereview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maddycosta","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maddy Costa","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maddycosta","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maddycosta","references":[],"firstName":"","lastName":"costa"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"ca9fc971db9af6653ab5cc76d48202de785474dd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734681451/The-Julie-Ruin.-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734681451/The-Julie-Ruin.-005.jpg","source":"Jim Bennett/Corbis","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"The Julie Ruin.","suppliersReference":"51417580","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Jim Bennett/Corbis","caption":"‘Exquisitely argue the need for accessible feminism’ … the Julie Ruin.

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-01T18:21:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

He’s one of the most popular underground rappers working, known for his oft-hilarious, ever-whimsical wordplay. While his lyrical tropes are unique (fine foods, unflappable characters, gaudy furnishings), his flow is not. Almost everyone who hears him is immediately reminded of Ghostface Killah, the mid-40s Wu-Tang swordsmith who is one of the most acclaimed rappers in the genre’s history. </p><p>Since Bronson’s ascent at the beginning of the decade, the pair have managed to coexist peacefully. When asked about their similarities, Bronson usually shrugged off comparisons but paid homage, and Ghostface was more inclined to feel flattered than ripped off. But this week their relationship went south, following Bronson’s appearance on the ESPN show SportsNation. When asked about Ghostface, Bronson went off script: “He’s not rapping like this no more,” he said, adding that Ghostface “needs something” – seeming to imply that he is no longer relevant. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T17:21:38.751+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The pair clashed after Bronson suggested Ghostface might not be the force he once was, but his diss track via video response shows Tony Starks has still got it</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aqcv","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8ebf1866c2ede373adce78eeb39d1c4284f75cdd/0_0_620_372/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457563117","byline":"Ben Westhoff","internalPageCode":"2341872","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-25T12:15:00-04:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/rap","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/rap","references":[]},{"id":"music/hip-hop","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-westhoff","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Westhoff","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-westhoff","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-westhoff","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Westhoff is the author of Dirty South, the former L.A.

become renowned as one of the pioneers of so-called krautrock. A talented graphic artist as well as a versatile experimental musician, Moebius shared the restlessness of many of his contemporaries in divided postwar Germany, and helped to create a new musical genre, largely shaped by the development of electronic instruments and synthesizers, through which to express it.</p><p>It was while he was living in Berlin in the late 1960s that he met Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Conrad Schnitzler – founders of the art and music collective the Zodiak Free Arts Lab – with whom he formed the band Kluster. In 1971, following Schnitzler’s departure, Kluster became Cluster and – notwithstanding several temporary retirements – continued to record and perform live until 2010.

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to

Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel. According to his forthcoming single - We Try But We Don’t Fit In - isolation is getting to him: he has even got a song, Nothing at All, that finds him moaning “What am I good for?”, answering himself: “Nothing at all”.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-25T16:11:19.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Lo-fi synth angst from Day Wave, Sunflower Bean hear voices, and Boycrush ft Madeira wreak lovely, summery electro fluff </p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497g4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432548303249/76e165e9-8e2a-47ef-9ea5-6a01b5d29641-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456902457","byline":"Paul Lester","internalPageCode":"2308450","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-05-28T12:08:18Z"},"tags":[{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/the-playlist","references":[],"description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world"},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/listen-up","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/listen-up","references":[],"description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n"},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/indie","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/indie","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paullester","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Paul Lester","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paullester","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/paullester","references":[],"bio":"<p>Paul Lester been contributing to the Guardian for most of this century.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br /></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T11:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>With the third Vaccines album out next week, frontman Justin Young talks us through what the band

for the summer, it’s Hey Mama. Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

– My Kinda Swag</strong></h2><p>Born in Devon but raised in Australia, Emmi has been writing songs for other singers over the last few years. As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-23T23:27:43.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432286121897/a4c7f72d-5fee-4a7b-b9c4-c8f301004703-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456870338","internalPageCode":"2307364","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/the-playlist","references":[],"description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world"},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/listen-up","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/listen-up","references":[],"description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n"},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelcragg","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Corea and Herbie Hancock with the improv duet they launched in the 1970s (caught here in Frankfurt in 1978 – watch from 33’50”) unsurprisingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/08/chick-coreaherbie-hancock-review-quicksilver-exchange-from-jazz-royalty\">sold out the Barbican</a> for two nights – and the now-septuagenarian pair uncorked a torrent of music. Back in 1978, Corea and Hancock explored abstract-improv pretty sympathetically (they were a little mechanical with it last week), but conversely shared melodies with a breezy openness. This time around, the pleasure they get from playing games with each other’s diverse experiences and harmonic resources led them toward more private dialogues, but the on-stage intimacy only heightened the crowd’s anticipation of how long it would be before Maiden Voyage or Spain turned up. They’re cosier and a bit lovey-dovey on stage these days, but the two maestros showed they were still at the top of their inimitable game. <br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-20T08:12:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Standout shows in recent weeks from a club-infused Neneh Cherry and a lovey-dovey Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock have this week’s playlist returning to some classic past recordings</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajtm","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/741a997def726e77717811ee0179ad8a743c8b4c/267_280_3501_2101/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457488824","byline":"John Fordham","internalPageCode":"2336953","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/the-playlist","references":[],"description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world"},{"id":"music/jazz","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Jazz","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/jazz","references":[]},{"id":"music/herbie-hancock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Herbie Hancock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/herbie-hancock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/herbie-hancock","references":[]},{"id":"music/chick-corea","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Chick Corea","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/chick-corea","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/chick-corea","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/listen-up","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/listen-up","references":[],"description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n"},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnfordham","type":"contributor","webTitle":"John Fordham","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnfordham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/johnfordham","references":[],"bio":"<p>John Fordham is the Guardian's main jazz critic.

For Bahdeni Nami, his second proper studio album, he’s enlisted help in various guises from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/11/four-tet-kieran-hebden-morning-evening-plastic-people\">Four Tet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/16/groove-improve-dj-skills-dance-music-gilles-peterson\">Gilles Peterson</a>, Modeselektor and Legowelt. </p><p>But it’s not all change for Souleyman, whose live shows have lit up everything from Syrian weddings to sweatbox indie venues in north London. Recorded in Istanbul, this album is adorned with virtuosic saz work, handclaps, wails and plenty of lovelorn lyrics. He continues to blend these traditions with a relentless party-starting ethos, perhaps best observed on the title track, not to mention Legowelt’s club-orientated remix of it.

pianist takes on Rzewski’s demanding landmark anthem with Lisztian bravura and aplomb to end his Wigmore Hall residency","headline":"Igor Levit review – a technical challenge transcended","body":"<p>Frederic Rzewski’s The People United Will Never Be Defeated is a landmark of keyboard music in the second half of the 20th century, up there with Stockhausen’s 10th Piano Piece, Xenakis’s Herma, Ligeti’s Studies and the sonatas by Boulez and Barraqu&eacute; as one of the great challenges for any pianist with the necessary technique and intellectual curiosity. <a href=\"http://igor-levit.de/?lang=en\">Igor Levit</a> certainly has those qualities; he discovered Rzewski’s hour-long set of variations when he was a teenager and has been playing them ever since, and made them the main work in the final recital in his season-long Wigmore residency.<br /></p><p>Like all of <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ok5syg3\">Rzewski’s piano music</a>, The People United embraces a kaleidoscope of historical references. Bach’s Goldberg and Beethoven’s Diabelli are certainly the starting points for these 36 variations on the song by Sergio Ortega that became a symbol for the left in Chile during and after the Allende years. But Rzewski puts everything from the baroque to Stockhausen and beyond into the stylistic blender, throwing in references to a couple more revolutionary anthems (the Italian Bandiera Rossa and Eisler’s Solidarit&auml;tslied) along the way, to create a work that demands transcendental Lisztian bravura.<br

After becoming a huge part of the global mainstream between 1972 and 1981, Rastafarian musical culture suffered a hammer blow with Bob Marley’s death, but it has never really gone away. Still, it’s been a while since a new young Jamaican star packed a mainstream venue like this one, with the waving red-green-and-gold flags reminiscent of the time Gregory Isaacs played here in the 90s.</p><p> Chronixx has been tipped by Diplo and Marley’s old label boss, Chris Blackwell, and it’s easy to see why. The dreadlocked son of singer Chronicle skips, dances and shadowboxes like a natural. His music is steeped in the old school – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYBHNLWDDwY\">Black Uhuru’s rootsy reggae</a> crossed with lover’s rock – but has more modern elements such as dancehall: more Damian Marley than Bob.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-21T14:57:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>O2 Academy, Leeds </strong></p><p>Jamaican singer ups the ante with his infectious music that includes a withering but tuneful assault on British colonialism</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ap43","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437481541693/9bc7494e-222e-43fc-83e6-0b528772e354-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457548879","starRating":"3","byline":"Dave Simpson","internalPageCode":"2340930","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-21T00:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/reggae","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Reggae","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/reggae","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/reggae","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tone/livereview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/livereview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davesimpson","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Dave Simpson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davesimpson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/davesimpson","references":[],"bio":"<p>Dave Simpson is a Guardian music critic.

eccentric, but his new percussion concerto, entitled into the open … is more serious stuff. Gruber’s friend, mentor and publisher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/aug/02/obituary-david-drew\">David Drew died during its composition</a> – and that context offered one way of making sense of the series of silences percussionist Colin Currie and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/philharmonic\">BBC Philharmonic</a> threw out into the auditorium, in the closing minutes of this performance under <a href=\"http://www.johnstorgards.com/\">conductor John Storg&aring;rds</a> – as if, Gruber has said, a spirit were going out into open space.</p><p>The work starts off tautly, with the soloist’s notes captured and sustained by the orchestra, leaving a kind of aura; unlike Gruber’s previous percussion concerto, this one is dominated by tuned instruments. Yet in the long second episode, in which the soloist swaps marimba and cowbells for timpani and other drums, the lack of melodiousness makes it seem as though the soloist has lost his voice. From then on the work starts to sprawl, despite being yanked back into shape when the climax of each section draws soloist and orchestra together.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T00:00:44.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London</strong> </p><p>Colin Currie dashed across the stage

The gurning and guitar shapes evoke <a href=\"http://www.timeisonourside.com/twins.html\">those other Stones</a> too.

But his very last concert with the orchestra was reserved for the Proms, and another massive symphony. For many years, Beethoven’s Ninth was always played on the penultimate night of the Proms each year. Since that tradition was abandoned, the symphony’s scheduling in the season has become a moveable feast, though never before, I think, has it been included as early as the opening weekend.</p><p>Nelsons’ performance, though – echoing the one he gave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/22/cbso-andris-nelsons-review\">last autumn</a> as part of his complete Beethoven cycle in Birmingham’s Symphony Hall – would have been blazingly memorable whenever and wherever it had taken place. There were all the hallmarks that have become so recognisable over the seven seasons he has been in Birmingham, especially the meticulous attention to detail and the knack of making it all seem utterly fresh, combined with an unwavering certainty about what the music’s ultimate destination is. The dynamic range of this performance was huge – the pianissimos intense, the fortissimos immense – whether in the first stirrings of the opening movement, the furious rush of the scherzo or the careful building of the finale, layer by layer, towards its huge choral affirmation, in which Nelsons’ gestures seemed to invite the whole Albert Hall into celebrating along with the CBSO Chorus and soloists Lucy Crowe, Gerhild Romberger, Pavel Černoch and Kostas Smoriginas.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-21T00:01:19.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Albert

All that effort promoting your new album – the interviews, the online courting of controversy, unceremoniously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/madonna-falls-but-it-was-the-brit-awards-that-took-a-tumble\">falling on your arse at the Brits</a> – and you’re pipped at the post by one of the oldest tricks in the book, the one that Micky Dolenz of the Monkees famously described as “the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan”. It’s almost 60 years since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvUGi0xBm84\">Ricky Nelson performed Fats Domino’s I’m Walkin’</a> on his parents’ sitcom and ended up a real-life pop star, but launching a musical career by pretending to have a musical career on a TV show still seems to work like a dream. It’s not just that the soundtrack album of Empire – a soapy musical drama about a feuding family and their urban entertainment company that’s swiftly become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">one of the biggest TV shows in the US</a> – was successful: two members of the cast now have major-label deals in their own right.

href=\"http://www.tameimpala.com/\" title=\"\">Tame Impala</a> fans would be wise to regard the band’s third album not as a Tame Impala album at all, but one by a band called something like Domesticated Eland. Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/28/kevin-parker-soundtrack-my-life\" title=\"\">Kevin Parker</a> once again plays virtually every note on this self-produced record, as he did on his previous two outings, the&nbsp;heady hit album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/dec/07/best-albums-2012-tame-impala\" title=\"\"><em>Lonerism</em></a> (2012) and its predecessor, 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/20/tame-impala-innerspeaker-cd-review\" title=\"\"><em>Innerspeaker</em></a>, <em>Currents</em> sounds little like the work of Australia’s pre-eminent psychedelic rock hero.</p><p>The pedal-laden guitars are low in the mix. Instead, analogue keyboards whirr through 13 glistening tracks. Parker’s falsetto invokes Brian Wilson and Panda Bear – specifically Panda Bear fronting Daft Punk. There is one seven-minute opus here, the opening track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&amp;v=odeHP8N4LKc\" title=\"\">Let It Happen</a>. Blissed-out and party-ready, it recalls Daft Punk’s recent combination of vintage synth washes and live instrumentation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vifsqv_QXB0\" title=\"\">Random Access Memories</a>. It’s not the only one. There’s a kind of monomania too, bringing to mind Kanye West’s <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-19T23:55:01.283+01:00","standfirst":"<p>(Fiction)<br></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajp6","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436876482048/-Winning-candour--Kevin-P-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457491020","starRating":"3","byline":"Kitty Empire","internalPageCode":"2337126","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-09T09:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/tame-impala","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Tame Impala","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tame-impala","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/tame-impala","references":[]},{"id":"music/psychedelia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Psychedelia","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/psychedelia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/psychedelia","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kittyempire","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Kitty Empire","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kittyempire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/kittyempire","references":[],"bio":"<p>Kitty Empire is the Observer's pop critic.

Al Pacino takes Tilston’s role. Here, the songwriter casts a lingering look over his career since that 1971 postcard, paying tribute to the influential Soho folk scene on Grass Days, mourning a friend on The Way It Was, and nodding to Nick Drake on The Riverman Has Gone, where Tilston’s keen political blade shows its edge. Mostly the mood is personal and reflective, with Tilston’s guitar supported by deft touches of bass, autoharp and piano. Classy work.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-19T08:00:08.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>(Proper)</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak8g","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436895081647/Steve-Tilston-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457495724","starRating":"3","byline":"Neil

Sensibly, the songs are left this time to sink or swim on their own merits. At first, this seems to work: Painted is an arresting opener, Plapinger’s multitracked vocals repeatedly asking: “What did you think would happen?”, offset by Hershenow’s house-influenced euphoric backing; the more introspective Wrong Victory is equally powerful. Elsewhere, there are pleasing similarities with <a href=\"http://www.ibreakhorses.se\" title=\"\">I Break Horses</a> and a dialled-back Florence Welch. But as the album progresses, Plapinger’s vocals too often fail to engage, particularly on the more downbeat tracks, and there is a paucity of good ideas towards the end.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-19T08:00:08.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>(RCA)</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4akk8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436955342248/Paucity-of-good-ideas-Liz-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457499959","starRating":"2","byline":"Phil Mongredien\r\n","internalPageCode":"2337722","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-09T08:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/indie","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/indie","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/phil-mongredien","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Phil Mongredien","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phil-mongredien","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/phil-mongredien","references":[],"bio":"<p>Phil Mongredien is a sub at the Observer</p>","firstName":"phil","lastName":"mongredien"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webTitle":"The Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Critics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"The New Review","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"03569571ba0b29707d65ec7ee1150d541956cdb8","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436955352297/Paucity-of-good-ideas-Liz-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Invision","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436955352297/Paucity-of-good-ideas-Liz-009.jpg","source":"Invision/AP","photographer":"Owen Sweeney","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"'Paucity of good ideas': Lizzy Plapinger and Max Hershenow.

After a slight detour on their last two records, which attempted to diversify their sound by introducing new instruments and global influences, this fifth album pares it back to the basics: solid instrumental tracks layered with spacey effects and squealing guitars. The urge to sound up to date on tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlcywgEMuGI\" title=\"\">Cream on Chrome</a> is outweighed by retro impulses – I Will Return is a cover of the 1971 Springwater soft-rock hit.

doubt Ezra Furman will ever be a star, topping the charts, headlining festivals, getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-23T23:27:43.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of performer who makes you feel like a teenager all

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","headline":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air Supply","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T00:00:44.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>In Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

The Hall&eacute;’s chief executive, John Summers, told the Today programme that the idea was to introduce new audiences to the “great music” that the orchestra plays, and that this format was a way of getting to the substance rather than the style of the usual concert hall conventions. </p><p>That might seem like an odd thing to say, given that the concert presents an atypical programme (10 short pieces rather than a substantial symphony or concerto) in an unconventional way: listeners will be able to “come and go as you like”, and – shock horror! – “bring your drinks in”, and each of the works on the programme will be introduced on screen. This all means putting a lot of new-fangled stylings before more traditional kinds of musical substance. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-21T15:24:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The Hallé is throwing open the doors of Bridgewater Hall to try to introduce new audiences to classical music.

The three women were close contemporaries in years – Holiday and Lutcher were born just six months apart in 1915 – but not in fame: like so many swing artists of the 1940s and early 50s, Lutcher’s popularity didn’t survive the onslaught of rock’n’roll. Six decades later, pressing play on one of her hits feels like popping the cork on a bottle of sunshine: there is such bright, cheeky verve in her voice as it bounces across a rhythm and lets go of the melody so that notes shoot balloon-like into the sky. This might be why she never reached the heights of fame the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ella-fitzgerald\">Ella</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-holiday\">Billie</a> did: she wasn’t a deep-in-the-soul singer the way they were. She had trained as a pianist: <a href=\"http://louisianaculturalvistas.org/nellie-lutcher/\">singing was an accident</a>, something she was pestered into by the patrons of LA’s lounge bars, where she was a jobbing player in the 1930s. She bluntly fended them off, until they showed her the extra money that was in it. </p><p>That same pragmatism and sureness-of-self beams from her 1947 breakthrough hit, Hurry on Down, one of many songs she wrote herself. “Hurry on down to my house, baby, anybody home but me,” she beckons over a skittery piano line, “Hurry through the alley so the neighbours won’t see.” She’s almost panting with anticipation by the time she reaches the pay-off, voice sharpening up into a reprimand as she declares: “Please come down just as soon as you can / If you can’t I’ll have to call Sam – he’ll hurry on down.” The feminist writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Brownmiller\">Susan Brownmiller</a>, who first came across Lutcher in 1955, was instantly besotted: what thrilled her, <a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19730517&amp;id=lNRHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6278,3603055&amp;hl=en\">she later wrote in the Village Voice</a>, was Lutcher’s imperiousness, the bold manner in which she was “always on top of the situation”.<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-21T13:27:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Nellie

It’s an astonishingly multi-dimensional insight into two short pieces, the 13th of his Etudes for solo piano, <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works-inside-the-score-%C3%A9tude-13.html\">L’escalier du Diable</a>, (“The Devil’s Staircase”) and the first movement of the much earlier <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works-inside-the-score-musica-ricercata-no-i.html\">Musica Ricercata</a> – and as a collaboration with the Ruhr piano festival, it’s completely, absolutely free for anyone to view, <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works-inside-the-score.html\">and you should</a>.</p><p>Here’s why: in the <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works-inside-the-score-%C3%A9tude-13.html\">Etude</a>, Aimard (who was <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works.html\">Ligeti’s</a> favourite interpreter of this music) takes you on a revelatory journey into the inner workings of one of Ligeti’s most immediate yet complex, virtuosically dazzling yet emotionally dark pieces. The score scrolls alongside Aimard’s specially recorded performance of L’escalier du Diable, but there’s much more: Aimard tells us about his relationship with the piece, his view on the essential drama of the music (“a struggle that goes nowhere … maybe only to the apocalypse”), and describes his interpretative approach to the difficulties of performing the five-minute-long Etude, technically and poetically. And at every point in the score, you can click an icon to watch a <a href=\"http://www.explorethescore.org/gy%C3%B6rgy-ligeti-piano-works-inside-the-score-%C3%A9tude-13.html\">masterclass</a>, from last year’s <a href=\"https://tickets.aldeburgh.co.uk/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=EB3C1F64-779C-45A6-9955-A11CBD4CD990&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=CB14E973-BD09-41BE-825D-0737FF695F47\">Aldeburgh festival</a>, in which Aimard takes a pianist through the score’s challenges. There’s also testimony from the scientist who inspired Ligeti’s explorations in fractals and chaos theory at the time he was writing the Etudes, and you can see Ligeti’s own comments on the piece, collated from the available manuscript sources.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-20T14:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The composer’s favourite interpreter has provided an

The singer was a professional dancer before she turned to music, and has always incorporated spectacular movement into her live shows. For Soundtrack 7: The Performances, her contribution to the Manchester international festival, the focus is almost exclusively on motion. For seven days, the public have been invited to sit in on the real-time creation of a brand new dance-based performance piece rooted, we are told, in seven narratives from her own life, and set to her own music, old and new. <br /></p><p>Those who did not get tickets have been able to follow its progress on a dense, abstract <a href=\"http://f-k-a-twigs.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr page</a> filled with short snippets of film; those who did are summoned to the Old Granada studios in small groups of around 30, where they will watch for an hour as the work comes together. The hope is for an experience like that of PJ Harvey’s recent Somerset House residency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/pj-harvey-recording-in-progress-somerset-house-review\">Recording in Progress</a> – the promise of intimate insight into the creative process which should, in turn, enhance the finished creation. I sit in on a couple of sessions for the work that will accompany How’s That, on the penultimate day of rehearsals. Before we enter, there are formalities to adhere to: no talking, no eating, phones off – a reminder that letting us sit in on this is a matter of trust, lest we be tempted to crack open a packet of Hula Hoops and start taking selfies in front of the stage. It’s all very serious, but as an extra layer of theatricality, it’s fun and adds to the intrigue. One last reminder before we’re let into the studio: we are not to clap. “This is absolutely not a performance,” says a nice volunteer, sternly.<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-20T14:54:43.375+01:00","standfirst":"<p>For her Manchester international festival show, FKA twigs invited fans to watch rehearsals.

Friends, therapy – and red wine","body":"<p>Joy Williams had an unusual journey into music, because pop and rock were strangers in the family home when she was growing up in California. Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-01T18:21:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The singer had to reinvent herself after the dramatic implosion of the Civil Wars.

I’m having a late start, because I had a meeting last night with Chuck Lorre, the creator of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/25/two-and-a-half-men-sheen-charlie\">Two and a Half Men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a>. We’re trying to make a musical out of Painted From Memory, the album I did with Elvis Costello. Elvis and I wrote eight new songs.

I thought songs were so simple that I could do five of them a day, but songs that sound simple are deceptive. It’s a very complicated process. So I left my job as pianist for the Ames Brothers [singing quartet] to go and start writing at the <a href=\"http://www.thebrillbuilding.com/wp-content/gallery/the-building/img_5693.jpg\">Brill Building</a> (1), but had no success.

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T14:27:20.053+01:00","standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

Not only was <em>Speech Therapy</em> a precursor to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/kate-tempest-we-live-in-crazy-times-you-cant-tell-a-story-without-it-feeling-political\">Kate Tempest</a>’s brand of British hip-hop, it was also a rarely aired dispatch from the UK’s alternative rap scene.</p><p>The win should have been the highlight of Debelle’s short career so far, but Tim Jonze, the <em>Guardian</em>’s music editor, who was at the Grosvenor House hotel when <em>Speech Therapy</em>’s victory was announced, recalls the reaction in the room as one of surprise, rather than celebration. “The place fell into a shocked silence, except for one little island of elated screams and astonished expressions,” he remembers. “The year before, Elbow triumphed and the whole room united in goodwill for them. But this time you got the feeling half the room didn’t even know who Speech Debelle was, let alone why she’d beaten the likes of Bat for Lashes.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-19T17:09:18.539+01:00","standfirst":"Three years after winning the Mercury prize, the rapper suffered a major meltdown.

Just give the British companies &pound;100m – it’s as easy as that!” The Australian opera director is on passionate, trenchant form. He has two shows in the UK this summer: a new production of <a href=\"http://www.glyndebourne.com/tickets-and-whats-on/events/2015/saul/\">Handel’s Saul for his debut at Glyndebourne</a> this month, and his globe-conquering production of <a href=\"http://english.komische-oper-berlin.de/schedule/magic-flute/\">Mozart’s The Magic Flute</a>, which comes to the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/2015/magicflute#.VX7Fk2TF_5o\">Edinburgh festival</a> next month.</p><p>A nearly unstoppable tumult of ideas, energy and opinion, Kosky is as charismatic and inspirational in person as his productions are intense and thrilling. Opera in cinemas? “Cinemas and live streaming aren’t the future of opera. They’re just marketing tools. The future of opera is not getting people 12,000 miles away to see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDvE8uKWznc\">Anna Netrebko</a>. That’s the death of opera.” The problem with British ideas of music-theatre? “There is an obsession with literalism and a fear of abstraction.” Doing a production in the middle of the sheep and somnolence of the Sussex downs at Glyndebourne? “They’re not getting Barrie-lite. I said to them, ‘I would love to come, but you’re not getting a Barrie summer production.’”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-16T16:12:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Epic, inventive and physical, Barrie Kosky’s operas even rattle his singers.

Here’s a song from their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/16/never-forget-review-young-uns-folk-historians\">Never Forget</a> album, written by Sean Cooney in tribute to the man who married the musician’s great grandmother Mary Jane in Sunderland in 1913, but was then killed a year later at the start of the Great War.<br /></p> <h2>Lau: The Bell That Never Rang</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoCQTbzMgZY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoCQTbzMgZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The title track from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/30/lau-the-bell-that-never-rang-review\">new album</a> by the most experimental trio on the British folk scene shows their new change of direction. There are reminders of their complex, improvised interplay between fiddle, accordion, guitar and electronica on the new set – but there’s a far greater emphasis on songs, including this finely–sung piece from guitarist Kris Drever.<br /></p> <h2>The Foghorn Stringband: Outshine The Sun</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttu0emwHVRY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ttu0emwHVRY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Formed in Portland, Oregon, The Foghorn Stringband are a quartet who are rapidly becoming celebrities of the Americana scene. They all sing, and have developed a slick, furious and exhilarating style featuring mandolin, fiddle, upright bass, guitar and banjo. Here’s their treatment of an old Charlie Poole song, recorded live in Washington.</p> <h2>Olivia Chaney: Holiday</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAkD5zL5Epc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAkD5zL5Epc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Once a student at the Royal Academy of Music, Olivia Chaney is an impressive instrumentalist, either on acoustic guitar, harmonium or piano, who specialises in thoughtful, exquisite and often highly personal songs. This is a solo piano treatment of Holiday, from her new album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/12/olivia-chaney-the-longest-river-review-kings-horses-waxwing-false-bride\">The Longest River</a>. <br /></p> <h2>Mbongwana Star: Malukayi (feat Konono No 1)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJCwfjl_sXc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJCwfjl_sXc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>From the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mbongwana Star are an intriguing new band started by Coco and Theo, once members of the massively successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/15/staff-benda-bilili-where-did-it-go-wrong\">Staff Benda Bilili</a>. On their debut album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/11/mbongwana-star-from-kinshasa-exclusive-album-stream\">From Kinshasa</a> they mix African styles with electronics, hefty bass lines, and – on this track – the powerful, hypnotic rhythms of their compatriots Konono No 1.</p> <h2>Angaleena Presley: American Middle Class</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0S0SYg6YR4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F0S0SYg6YR4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Once a member of the best–selling female country trio Pistol Annies, Angaleena Presley is a singer–songwriter from Beauty, Kentucky, who is now becoming equally well-known as a soloist. This is the title track from her new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/11/angaleena-presley-american-middle-class-review-exceptional-vocal-and-lyrical-touch\">album</a>.</p> <h2>Jackie Oates: Can’t Be Sure</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfZpjgw1pw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmfZpjgw1pw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In her cheerfully unassuming way, Jackie Oates has emerged as one of the finest female folk singers of the current revival, mixing traditional material with experimentation while working with the Cecil Sharp Project or Imagined Village. Her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/26/jackie-oates-spyglass-and-the-herringbone-review-sundays-cant-be-sure\">The Spyglass &amp; The Herringbone</a> album consists mostly of traditional songs but includes this reworking of a 1989 track by the Sundays.<br /></p> <h2>Seun Kuti: Black Woman</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkWwEY-se4o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkWwEY-se4o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The youngest son of the Nigerian legend Fela Kuti, Seun has continued his father’s style by mixing Afrobeat with angry political songs. This summer he is giving a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/12/seun-kute-and-egypt-80-review-afrobeat-style-but-not-substance\">series of low–key shows at Ronnie Scott’s</a> in London – he is, after all, an impressive jazz saxophonist. But here is a reminder of his UK appearance last year, when he returned to Glastonbury, with a set that included Black Woman, from his 2014 album A Long Way To The Beginning.<br /></p> <h2>Flavia Coelho: Por Cima</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_suH5MPf10\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_suH5MPf10?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Born in Rio but now based in Paris, Flavia Coelho has created an easy-going, relaxed fusion by mixing Brazilian styles with a dash of reggae and other Caribbean influences. It’s great summer music, as demonstrated by her new album, which includes contributions by the great Tony Allen. This is the opening track.<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-13T11:56:56.730+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Angry political Afrobeat, experimental British folk, country music from Kentucky and soulful Italian pizzica.

Fast-forward a few years, to the middle of the 80s, and everything was suddenly silenced. An attack of meningitis left me with permanent hearing loss. When I emerged from a coma, the first words to my mother were: “Tell me later mum, I can’t hear you.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p><p>Coming to terms with my hearing loss was hard and frustrating. Learning to lipread enabled me to communicate with the so-called mainstream world and helped build my confidence and independence.

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires

carefully cultivated candour","body":"<p>The internet was clearly starving for gifs of Beyonc&eacute; using her bare foot as a phone in a hotel room and, naturally, she has delivered. The video for 7/11, her new track, is made up of cameraphone snippets of her messing about in various suites with a gaggle of backing dancers. She wears a jumper with the word ”Kale” on it, twerks a bit, then falls over while attempting to use her own leg as a skipping rope. She’s pop’s Benny Hill! She’s also its savviest businesswoman, and – for all the goofing around – the 7/11 clip is as steely an insistence as ever that she is the world’s biggest pop star.</p><p>It’s right there in the song’s closing refrain: “Man, cos I’m so fresh / Fresher than you.” She’s not talking to her fans, but puffing out her chest to other pop stars (just as, I’d argue, Flawless’s line “bow down bitches” is about her competition in the music business, not other women in general). She’s blown everyone else out of the water, again, and made it look easy. Her message is clear: you want to spend millions of dollars on a high-concept music video? Go ahead. Here’s something I knocked out in an afternoon, on the spot, in my pants. Even the choreography, if you can call it that, is hilariously literal. “I’m spinning, I’m spinning,” she sings, while she does some spinning. “My foot up, put my foot down,” she sings, as she puts her foot up, then down again. She blows a party whistle. Cut to black. Beat <em>that</em>. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-24T11:54:42.000Z","standfirst":"<p>Beyoncé’s new video creates the image of a woman just like us, but quite unlike any

He’s one of the most popular underground rappers working, known for his oft-hilarious, ever-whimsical wordplay. While his lyrical tropes are unique (fine foods, unflappable characters, gaudy furnishings), his flow is not. Almost everyone who hears him is immediately reminded of Ghostface Killah, the mid-40s Wu-Tang swordsmith who is one of the most acclaimed rappers in the genre’s history. </p><p>Since Bronson’s ascent at the beginning of the decade, the pair have managed to coexist peacefully. When asked about their similarities, Bronson usually shrugged off comparisons but paid homage, and Ghostface was more inclined to feel flattered than ripped off. But this week their relationship went south, following Bronson’s appearance on the ESPN show SportsNation. When asked about Ghostface, Bronson went off script: “He’s not rapping like this no more,” he said, adding that Ghostface “needs something” – seeming to imply that he is no longer relevant. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T17:21:38.751+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The pair clashed after Bronson suggested Ghostface might not be the force he once was, but his diss track via video response shows Tony Starks has still got it</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aqcv","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8ebf1866c2ede373adce78eeb39d1c4284f75cdd/0_0_620_372/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457563117","byline":"Ben Westhoff","internalPageCode":"2341872","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-25T12:15:00-04:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/rap","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/rap","references":[]},{"id":"music/hip-hop","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-westhoff","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Westhoff","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-westhoff","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-westhoff","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Westhoff is the author of Dirty South, the former L.A.

become renowned as one of the pioneers of so-called krautrock. A talented graphic artist as well as a versatile experimental musician, Moebius shared the restlessness of many of his contemporaries in divided postwar Germany, and helped to create a new musical genre, largely shaped by the development of electronic instruments and synthesizers, through which to express it.</p><p>It was while he was living in Berlin in the late 1960s that he met Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Conrad Schnitzler – founders of the art and music collective the Zodiak Free Arts Lab – with whom he formed the band Kluster. In 1971, following Schnitzler’s departure, Kluster became Cluster and – notwithstanding several temporary retirements – continued to record and perform live until 2010. In the mid-1970s, Moebius and Roedelius teamed up with Michael Rother of the band Neu! to form Harmonia, who made three studio albums including Tracks and Traces (1976), featuring <a

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIIMQJaNmk\">Deep Purple – Speed King</a></h2><p>Although it was their fifth album, In Rock was the record that established Deep Purple as one of the genre-defining hard rock bands. The early albums by what became known as the mark I version of the band, featuring Rod Evans on vocals, had been a mixture of late-60s psychedelia and pop with few hints of what the band would later become. All that changed with the arrival of Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to form Deep Purple mark II. The album’s opening number begins with an ear-splitting wall of shredding guitar, before Blackmore unleashes that raw and dirty riff while Gillan cut-and-pastes fragments of well-known rock’n’roll lyrics. For the instrumental break it changes tack, with a call-and-response between Blackmore’s very bluesy licks and Jon Lord’s organ. There are strong echoes of the rock’n’roll that Blackmore paid his dues playing at end-of-the-pier shows in the 60s, but this was rock’n’roll turned up to 11.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-07-22T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Take a journey through the tempestuous career of the Deep Purple and Rainbow guitarist, who fires
