In 1952, the draconian era of home secretary David Maxwell Fyfe, the mathematician and wartime codebreaker Alan Turing was prosecuted for gross indecency and forced to undergo “chemical castration” hormone treatment in lieu of a prison sentence, after which pointless ordeal he killed himself.</p> <p>Turing was a war hero equal to Alanbrooke or Montgomery, but unlike these men his lifelong vow of government secrecy meant that he did not have the prestige that might have made his persecutors think twice. Just a decade before, Turing had done perhaps more than any individual to defeat Hitler by cracking the Enigma code in which Nazi military instructions were delivered, and then calculating precisely how much of this information the Allies could act on without giving the game away. But a shabby and squalid homophobia reduced Turing’s postwar career and happiness to rubble.</p> <p>Graham Moore’s screenplay, Tyldum’s direction and Benedict Cumberbatch’s lead performance all rightly convey anger at this tragic waste, although the movie insists on a faintly glib alignment of genius, autism and homosexuality, and also overloads the drama with fictional speculations about Soviet spying and the “fifth man”, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/may/15/features11.g2\">John Cairncross</a>. The final credits state that the Enigma case was a government secret for 50 years after the war: a little misleading, as Ian McEwan’s TV play The Imitation Game (a fictional variant on Turing) came out in 1980, and Hugh Whitemore’s stage play Breaking the Code, starring Derek Jacobi as Turing, was first performed in 1986. Michael Apted’s 2001 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89626/enigma\">Enigma</a>, based on the Robert Harris novel, was a fictional drama based on wartime codebreaking at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/12/bletchley-park-national-museum-computing-berlin-wall-restored-colossus-codebreaking\">Bletchley Park</a>, in which Turing was removed from the picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/06/the-imitation-game-watch-benedict-cumberbatch-as-alan-turing-in-the-oscar-tipped-biopic-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/434zq\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2188403\"                data-video-name=\"The Imitation Game: watch Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing in the Oscar-tipped biopic - video exclusive\"                data-video-provider=\"StudioCanal\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/6/1415280432762/Benedict-Cumberbatch-as-A-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451426700\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/6/1415280430366/Benedict-Cumberbatch-as-A-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame/141106ImitationGame.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Cumberbatch is really good as Turing. Probably no other casting was possible. He is a bit Sherlockian, but it is a confident, plausible and thought-through performance. His Turing is utterly frank, entirely tactless, completely insufferable: people who do not have first-class minds, or are not likely to offer real assistance to those who have, are dismissed. He has the apparent arrogance and abruptness of a pampered child or brilliant bachelor don, which infuriates his commanding officer at Bletchley Park, Commander Denniston, played with gimlet-eyed ferocity by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/12/charles-dance-more-risks-british-tv\">Charles Dance</a>. Maybe Cumberbatch studied Peter O’Toole’s TE Lawrence before filming began, or Karl Johnson’s Ludwig Wittgenstein in Derek Jarman’s 1993 film. This Turing has the weirdly guileless candour that a military man would mistake for dumb insolence – although for me Cumberbatch does not resemble the famous semi-profile portrait photograph of Alan Turing whose half-smile has a dreamy, romantic quality.</p> <p>The film flashes back and forth between three eras: his arrest in the 1950s, his wartime triumph in the 40s and his unhappy boarding-school childhood in the 20s; Alex Lawther is excellent as the clever, lonely schoolboy Turing. The grownup mathematician arrives at Bletchley Park and instantly antagonises one and all with a refusal to be a good chap and to pay lip service to rank and precedence: those who are nettled include his notional superior, Hugh Alexander, played with sleek confidence by Matthew Goode.</p> <p>The film stretches credulity by having the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\">MI6</a> chief on hand a great deal, to offer cynical comments and instructions: this is Stewart Menzies, played urbanely by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/23/mark-strong-interview-stark-bare-brutal-arthur-miller\">Mark Strong</a>. But one of the most vivid characters is Turing’s fellow codebreaker and friend Joan Clarke, who really was briefly engaged to Turing, a strategic alliance from which the movie extracts a shrewdly imagined and sympathetic drama. It is an excellent portrayal from Keira Knightley, who shows that with the right role she is a natural star. Tuppence Middleton plays Joan’s sexy friend Helen, whose chance remark in the pub triggers a vital insight in Turing’s mind.</p> <p>The story of the Enigma codebreaking is fascinating and heroic, and it is impossible not to be caught up in it. There is an irresistible romance in the idea that people who are good at crossword puzzles can defeat evil. The Imitation Game has one or two war-movie cliches and all the business about Soviet spying is cumbersome and unconvincing; the film creates a problem for itself with that. It is a problem for which Cumberbatch’s performance is an almost complete solution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

Yeah, it’s coming in <strong>(2)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>You narrate a new documentary about </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao\"><strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong></a><strong>. Do you think you’re similar, in that you’re both respected in your fields, but you’re reaching the age limit for your best-known work?</strong></p> <p>That’s a strange comparison. Manny’s, what, 34? I hope to be doing this when I’m 90, you know. If you think that 62 is way past the age of acting, then …</p> <p><strong>No, no (3)! I meant the action stuff.</strong></p> <p>Oh, the action stuff. Well, 60 is the new 40, so I’m not going to complain.</p> <p><strong>Can you relate to Manny?</strong></p> <p>I was a boxer as a kid, from the age of nine to about 17. But Manny was brought up in a fucking shack with rebels firing guns and stuff. He was facing death on a daily basis. And not having food to eat! That’s rock, rock bottom. What a foundation to build your future on; there’s nowhere to go but up. So, when he fights, beside his natural talent – which is phenomenal – you’ve got this fucking anger. But it’s a very controlled anger. He’s fighting not just for himself, but for all of the Philippines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqi_DVcSMPY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qqi_DVcSMPY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The official trailer for Manny, the Neeson-narrated documentary about Manny Pacquiao.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How were you as a boxer?</strong></p> <p>I was an amateur. I won a few titles. Looking back, I’d say I was competent.</p> <p><strong>Did you have a nickname or anything?</strong></p> <p>Nope. I wasn’t a knockout specialist. I had a good left jab and I just used that a lot. Not exactly a crowd-pleaser.</p> <p><strong>Have you seen any of Pacquiao’s acting roles (4)?</strong></p> <p>No I haven’t. I saw a sample of them on the documentary and it threw me a little bit. I thought, OK … maybe let’s save those for another day.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever had any projects like that, where you haven’t necessarily played to your strongest skills?</strong></p> <p>I did a movie once that nobody saw, called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKe2-vUQ1s\">Duet For One</a>. It was based on the life of Jacqueline du Pré, a violinist who suffered from multiple sclerosis. It was Julie Andrews, lovely Alan Bates, Max von Sydow and myself. Julie Andrews was playing Jacqueline du Pré. I played her sort of lover, a third-rate singer in a working men’s club. There’s a scene where I’m singing The Green, Green Grass of Home, and I’ve never been more nervous in all my life. Oh, my knees were shaking. Fuck me, I’m singing to Julie Andrews, you know? She can hold a tune.</p> <p><strong>That </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ1O6BEVP3k&amp;t=6m5s\"><strong>must be on YouTube, surely</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>Oh God, it won’t be.

The film doesn’t spend very long on his gambling or rumoured infidelities.</strong></p> <p>I know. But I think he more than hinted that he’d had a few flings. He obviously did. And his wife did, too, without saying it. We don’t need to know any more than that. This is a kid who grew up in the fucking jungle with nothing to eat. So, OK, it went to his head. He won all those world titles and he strayed a bit. He’s only human. I didn’t really want to see what his gambling debts may have been, you know? It’s powerful. You see him being vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>It ends on the biggest moment of vulnerability of all (6).</strong></p> <p>That fucking knockout. I remember watching that. I saw it on TV, I was on my own. I froze. I thought he was dead. I wondered if someone in the audience had shot him. He dropped like a tree. Fuck me, what a punch. Jesus wept.</p> <p><strong>Do you think he’ll ever retire?</strong></p> <p>I think he will. The doorman at my building is an ex-boxer and we’re always arguing. He says, “I think Manny’s got four more fights in him.” I say, “Four? Fuck me, he doesn’t have four more fights.” Maybe two. But I hope it’s just one and that’s it. He’s certainly fit enough for four, but that’s when he could get hurt. That’s the danger.</p> <p><strong>Last question. It seems like it’d be a waste if I had Liam Neeson on the phone and he didn’t threaten me …</strong></p> <p>Ugh, I can’t do that, mate. If I had 25 cents for every time I left a message on my son’s answer machine … No. No, I can’t do that <strong>(7)</strong>.</p> <p>• <em>Manny is released on video on demand on 17 November</em></p> <p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <p><strong>1)</strong> This is code for: “I don’t know what that means.”</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Nope, still no idea.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Imagine the most panicky voice in the world. Now triple it. Now triple it again.

Hasbro also has licenses to produce toys based on film franchises including Spider-Man and Avengers Assemble, while in a strong earnings call earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/21/hasbro-results-idUSL3N0ND21U20140421\">the company attributed</a> The Hunger Games to the popularity of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/nov/12/hunger-games-bow-arrow-toy-girls-catching-fire-christmas\">Rebelle series</a> of Nerf bows and arrows aimed at girls.</p> <p>If successful, Hasbro’s purchase would create a perfectly symbiotic match: merchandising opportunities for DreamWorks pictures furnished by Hasbro, while Hasbro provides a steady stream of potential intellectual property to mine for films – if the likes of Furreal Friends’ cuddy puppy Get Up and Go-Go can indeed be called intellectual property.</p> <p>Snobbery perhaps, but the paucity of new ideas in Hollywood is leading to some shameless toy-inspired films. Hasbro’s card game Magic: The Gathering, last seen being played in a classroom that bullies weren’t aware of, is being adapted by Fox. Meanwhile, Sony is developing Hasbros’ board game Candy Land, a cornerstone of many American childhoods that treats the dice-roll board game with an almost experimental level of minimalism. My Little Pony is already being turned into a new animated movie, Battleship became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/12/battleship-review\">a predictably formulaic action flick</a>, while Hasbro once had a Stretch Armstrong movie being prepped, set to “find a real emotional connection and resonance”, according to its creators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-71195b0b-f23c-4719-b1a5-a019e61ec773\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415882850174/3bd8f9ff-3112-41aa-b524-6f11ffc6cd75-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Transformers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transformers: Age of Extinction, based on Hasbro’s toy line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At their worst, these turn potential film art into extended infomercials – but they don’t have to be terrible. Ridley Scott was once lined up to direct a Monopoly movie about, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1637799/monopoly-movie-will-be-all-about-greed-ridley-scott-reveals/\">in his words</a>, “some horrible property scam guy”, which in the wake of the financial crisis could have been just loopy enough to work – and let’s not forget that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie\">The Lego Movie</a> was far, far better than many expected.</p> <p>So what might Hasbro tackle next? Surely their Nerf weapons are crying out to be the final scrape of the Hunger Games barrel, in the wake of The Maze Runner, Divergent et al – but any film must be set in a world where light retinal injuries from foam darts can prove instantly fatal. The infernal compulsiveness of Bop It! could be perfect for a study of human obsession starring Russell Crowe, with Jack Black as the voice of Bop It! Jenga could form the core of Christopher Nolan’s next inquiry into layered reality, The Game of Life could be the perfect sequel project for Terrence Malick, and Operation could either go for a Saw-style splatter-fest or a melancholy Ron Howard medical drama about a surgeon with Parkinson’s disease. </p> <p>Will we eventually end up exhausting every toy and game, until we’re left with Bela Tarr making a seven-hour film about the perpetual struggle of Snap? Perhaps.

consider myself something resembling an adult. I pay my taxes. I know how to drive an automobile. I can preheat an oven without any supervision. And yet, when it comes to cinematic representation of human flatulence, I find myself giggling like a kid in the back row during fourth-period social studies.</p> <p>Funnier even than the sound of the expelled gas vibrating its way past buttock flesh is any sort of detailed discussion of the gastrointestinal wind’s contours or qualities. If it can be assumed that the effluvium is particularly malodorous, and if someone is confined in a space with no access to outside ventilation, as is the case with poor <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/11/12/how-they-camouflaged-rob-riggle-in-dumb-and-dumber-to/\">Rob Riggle</a> who finds himself on the business end of both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels’s rectum during a scene in Dumb and Dumber To, well, you can just forget about it. No clever satirist, regardless of their verbal dexterity, can ever hope to best such a thing in terms of pure laughs.</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong – I take no pride in this confession. But my mind’s got a mind of its own, and I’d be lying if I said this movie didn’t crack me up on more than a few occasions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86526f822d62e7fec5870ff963b21e9b34970866\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415880084321/28b1b24b-c63a-4f98-8a47-cacf77ce267f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dumb and Dumber\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dumb and Dumber To is remarkably true to the original – down to the cheap sets and half-assed plot. It takes a while to get rolling, but once Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) hit the road for another absurd caper, it’s wall-to-wall buffoonery. The twin numbskulls bumble their way from Rhode Island to El Paso (named for the bean dip!) to try and find Harry’s long-lost daughter. You see, Harry needs a kidney transplant or he’s gonna die. (I told you this was hilarious!) The daughter was put up for adoption by Harry’s ex-flame (a very brusque Kathleen Turner) and raised by a science genius who is up for an award at the “Ken Conference” (clearly modelled on the TED Conference but, as you may or may not know, Ks are funny.) Our heroes have to get there, and also save the day from baddies giving chase to steal “a billion-dollar idea” from the stepfather inventor. And if I spend any more time detailing this ridiculous plot then, truly, the joke’s on me.</p> <p>Harry and Lloyd charge into each social encounter like bulls in a china shop. Keeping matters fresh is the wide spectrum to their styles of idiocy. Sometimes one is clearly dumber than the other. Sometimes they are angry put-down artists. Then they swiftly pivot into full-blown morons, drinking embalming fluid believing it to be a slushie. Daniels gets most of his laughs from being loud and clumsy, but Jim Carrey is still a rubberfaced marvel. The Farrelly Brothers realise that they’ve got gold on their hands and are extremely generous to him. One sequence is just a collection of Carrey mugging in close-up until his off-screen scene partner (foil Rob Riggle) ultimately interjects and asks: “What are you doing?” No answer proper answer is given, and the film just picks up where it left off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfwLKDifqNA\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfwLKDifqNA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In one champion moment, Carrey squeezes laughs from simply eating a hot dog in a weird way, even if there’s no real motivation for the behaviour. The move involves loading the dog with mustard, biting the edges from outside the bun, then chomping a little of the bun, then sliding the rest of the tube down past pursed lips, then using the remainder of the bun as a napkin to get the mustard off his face, then tossing the bun away. It’s an outstanding bit of unexpected physical comedy and Charlie Chaplin himself couldn’t do much better.</p> <p>None of this is to say that Dumb and Dumber To isn’t what you’d typically call a good movie. The movie cracks nonstop jokes and plenty of them just die on the screen. There’s no shortage of callbacks to the first film, some of which work better than others.</p> <p>The picture lasts an hour and 50 minutes but it feels like three days. It is annoying and exhausting, and I honestly couldn’t tell you whether or not this is part of the Farrellys’ twisted design. During one ceaseless sequence I actually muttered: “Ugh, I can’t take any more!” and my colleague seated beside me chuckled in agreement.

Earlier this year she published memoir Molly’s Game: High Stakes, Hollywood’s Elite, Hotshot Bankers, My Life in the World of Underground Poker, which <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/07/viper-room-hollywood-poker-game\">details her eight years running what was supposedly the most exclusive high stakes poker game in the world</a>. Deadline reports the book, extracts from which were published in Vanity Fair in July, has now been optioned by producer Mark Gordon, who is also working with Sorkin on the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de0541158ec314726c13342288c90102d28553d9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415877890192/d99af139-7aab-48b3-8aae-1605740038de-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Aaron Sorkin on 4 November 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Sorkin on 4 November 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />Bloom, 36, became embroiled in the world of high-stakes gambling after decamping to California when her hopes of making it as an Olympic skier - she was the No 3 ranked mogul competitor in north America at the age of 21 - were dashed. After waitressing in Los Angeles she began to host poker matches at the famous Viper Room club, but got in trouble with the law after demanding a share of the pot rather than tips.<br />Given the notoriety of her clients, and Sorkin’s relaxed attitude towards negative portrayals of real-life characters on the big screen, Deadline’s report begs the question whether DiCaprio, Affleck et al might find themselves turning up in the film version of Molly’s Game. Bloom gives positive appraisals of all the above in her memoir, though she reserves a greater level of opprobrium for Spider-Man star Tobey Maguire, allegedly a moody player and poor tipper. The New York Observer <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/05/exclusive-a-player-speaks-molly-bloom-takes-on-spider-man-actor-in-new-book/\">even alleged in June</a> that Maguire would routinely pay the entrance fees of $10,000 for celebrity friends such as DiCaprio in order to help recruit billionaire businessmen to Bloom’s tables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2011/feb/18/social-network-oscar-hustings-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/2n7pm\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1521391\"                data-video-name=\"Why The Social Network should win the best picture Oscar - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-371870438\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_794366418001_110218oscarssocialnetwork-4375772.jpg?pubId=281851582\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_794366416001_110218oscarssocialnetwork-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110218oscarssocialnetwork/110218oscarssocialnetwork.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Sorkin’s script for The Social Network won him the Oscar for best adapted screenplay in 2011.

It doesn’t go that well: they’re chased away by locals, Slim gets shot off his horse, and Willis has to escape by plunging into a river. In future, Willis and Glasscock conclude, they should avoid daytime holdups. Glasscock, a nitroglycerin expert, suggests they blow up safes at night. In 1919, when this scene is set, Willis Newton was 30 years old. He had established a criminal career of bank and train robbery as well as burglary, forgery and other offences. It was in 1920 that he and Glasscock set up their safebusting “business”, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p> <h2>Technology</h2> <p>The key to the Newton gang’s success was identifying square-door safes. Glasscock devised a nitroglycerin system detonated by a dynamite “cap” that would simply blow the door off. As the film correctly illustrates, this limited them to robbing smaller banks. By the 1920s, most larger banks in the US had gone over to round-door safes, which were harder to break into. Willis persuades an actual banker to give him a list of all the square-door safe banks in nearby states. “We promise never to rob your little bank,” he says with a winning smile – and it’s a deal. In real life, Willis did indeed acquire such a list from an official from the Texas Association of Bankers. Naughtily, the man sold it to him.</p> <h2>Money</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4b86cd17335819cf01e4f1b4bbf0058fea13612\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415808622608/80dde44d-697f-4183-9442-1b7d07ea3dcb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Newton gang’s spoils of thievery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Newton gang’s spoils of thievery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruising around in a banana-yellow Studebaker he bought with his ill-gotten gains (the film is right that the gang always drove Studebakers or Cadillacs), Willis puts together a gang. It consists of his brothers Dock (Vincent D’Onofrio), Jess (Ethan Hawke) and Joe (Skeet Ulrich). Joe, the youngest, is the most earnest: “You’re talking about taking people’s money,” he says, horrified. “No,” replies Willis, “the <em>bank’s</em> money … We are just little thieves stealing from the big thieves. That’s all.” Joe isn’t convinced, and nor is an old woman living next to the bank they rob straight afterwards. “That’s my money in that bank!” she hollers at the Newtons. They threaten to blow her building up. Undeterred, she lets off a fire siren – but the boys get away.</p> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Though the Newtons’ claim that they never actually killed anyone has not been conclusively disproved, they were violent criminals. The film prefers to portray them as lovable folk heroes, and it is right that witnesses at some of their robberies described them as surprisingly polite. Even so, it cannot disguise the fact that they did on occasion shoot, pistol-whip and beat their victims. It’s all very well to turn that into slapstick comedy on screen – but in real life, <a href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?Willis-Newtons-First-Train-Robbery---1914&amp;id=8390112\">newspaper reports suggest</a> that encounters with the Newtons could result in distinctly non-comic injuries. “Sure, we shot a few people, but we never killed a single man,” the real Willis Newton said later.</p> <h2>Justice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e572f74b317728c23cbd1f3832255ff7a52ff05\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415808422408/bdaf2463-8356-449b-8ac7-573ab71fd36d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Rondout train robbery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rondout train robbery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Newton gang’s last and greatest heist was the <a href=\"http://www.historyillinois.com/files/Markers/marker.php?marker_id=369\">Rondout train robbery</a>, which took place near Chicago on 12 June 1924. The Newtons and Glasscock were involved; a corrupt postal inspector, William J Fahy (David Jensen), was their man on the inside. It was estimated that the gang took more than $2m, making this the biggest train robbery in US history at the time. The brothers were all caught and given fairly light sentences, as the film shows; Fahy took most of the blame. The Newton gang ceased to operate in 1924, but it does not appear they entirely learned their lesson. The real Dock was arrested in 1968, at the age of 77, in the act of robbing a bank.

home of the Corleone clan in the 1972 classic film demands respect, with five bedrooms and a kitchen ‘to die for’","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Looking for a move to a home which demands – as its most famous (albeit fictional) owner might have mumbled – the right amount of respect?</p> <p>The perfect option may have arisen in the form of the New York mansion known to fans of The Godfather as the home of the Corleone clan in the 1972 film, which has gone up for sale at just under $3m (£1.8m).</p> <p>Described by the estate agents involved as an “enchanting English tudor” on sprawling grounds of 24,000 sq ft, the property is located at 110 Longfellow Ave, Staten Island.</p> <p>While its interior did not feature in the film, it provided the backdrop to a number of scenes, most notably as the mansion where the Corleones celebrated the wedding of daughter Connie, who was played by Talia Shire.</p> <p>Built in 1930, the house was in reality the home of the Norton family, who put it up for sale in 2010 having lived there for nearly nearly six decades.</p> <p>Its role in The Godfather came about after it was recommended to location scouts by actor and Staten Island-native Gianni Russo, who played Corleone son-in-law Carlo Rizzi.</p> <p>Gutted and renovated in 2012, the property comes with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, as well as a gym and a playroom.</p> <p>There is also plenty of room for running a family business from home – namely four garages and two offices. A granite saltwater pool also provides a backdrop for hosting parties, while a security system should help keep unwanted guests out.</p> <p>“The kitchen is to die for,” estate agent Joseph R Profaci told the Staten Island Advance.</p> <p>“It has anything you would want for entertaining – big open space, a huge island, and a very large eating area that opens up to the yard and pool.”</p> <p>Profaci added that his favourite feature of the house was a wooden door on the first floor which looked like the entrance to an old speakeasy.

Our own Peter Bradshaw, who gave it the full five stars, called the film “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\">thrillingly, dangerously new</a>”.</p> <p>I’m sorry, Peter. I’m sorry, everyone else. It’s a stinker. And that stink emanates almost entirely from one element: the bow-legged, squint-eyed, Selleck-moustached, fruity-voiced Daniel Plainview, as incarnated by modern cinema’s greatest exponent of industrial-scale ham, Daniel Day-Lewis.</p> <p>Day-Lewis is an acting behemoth, the only person in history to bag three Oscars for best actor (the middle one came for TWBB). These days, his very presence in a film denotes heft, seriousness, intent, a producer’s eyes firmly fixed on the awards season. There’s just one problem: he’s awful.</p> <p>It wasn’t ever thus. The young Day-Lewis had his moments. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83399/my-beautiful-laundrette\">My Beautiful Laundrette</a> he might not have been the most convincing London punk ever, but possessed charm, almost a lightness of touch. As Cecil Vyse in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/a-room-with-a-view\">A Room With a View</a> he was unrecognisable as a bumbling snob.</p> <p>But the longer his career has progressed, the more heavily weighted with statuettes the Day-Lewis mantelpiece, the more he has become leaden, mannered, affected, a legend in his own ham-heavy lunchtime.</p> <p>Before TWBB the low point was Bill “the Butcher” Cutting, from the similarly overpraised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gangs-of-new-york\">Gangs of New York</a>. He is a distant cousin to Plainview, with his luxuriantly foliaged upper lip, accent that sounds like John Gielgud auditioning for Taxi, and absurdly contrived, over-the-top outbursts. To this day I can’t hear the phrase <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVggUxEgv5k\">“Whoopsy daisy!”</a> without an inward flinch.</p> <p>Many people, Bradshaw included, explicitly enjoy Day-Lewis’s opulent approach, seeing it as a welcome contrast to today’s dominant, mumbled naturalism. But to my mind it has become so absurd, so elaborate – and let’s not even get into Day-Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2244230/Lincoln-Daniel-Day-Lewis-didnt-break-character-THREE-months-Spielberg-called-Mr-President.html\">infamous method-acting mania</a> – that all else about a film withers in its oppressive shade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2008/jul/04/1\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/xng3e\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"995909\"                data-video-name=\"There Will Be Blood: the deleted scene\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-335487811\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1648070578_gdn-nat-080704-jd-therewillbeblood2-16x9.flv\"></source> </video> <figcaption>There Will Be Blood: the deleted scene</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, TWBB is not all Day-Lewis’s fault. Well, no more than 90%. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, can be erratic but is usually at least interesting - his rambling shaggy dog story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81820/magnolia\">Magnolia</a> remains a favourite film of mine. But here he constructs a film far too much in his lead’s weighty image.</p> <p>What is intended as operatic, almost Biblical – the sociopathic Plainview cutting a swath across the messy and brutal 19th-century oil trade; his struggle with Paul Dano’s charlatan preacher Eli – seems to me just portentous, empty, especially stretched over almost three hours. Even Dano, often so unsettlingly watchable, seems to shrink when faced with the porcine might of his co-lead.</p> <p>Anderson does himself no favours with a ponderous script that, aiming at the epic and almost Shakespearean, tends to land with a splat in the absurd and silly.</p> <p>This is made all the worse by Day-Lewis’s enthusiastic gumming of any scenery in sight, and here his set-piece moments are easily the worst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHz-zZoBnbc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHz-zZoBnbc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Daniel Plainview introduces himself</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take Plainview’s introductory, “I’m an oil man” speech to suspicious locals. The intention is for him to appear sinister, Machiavellian, dangerously charismatic. Instead, mangled by Day-Lewis’s roving accent and gurning face, the address could only be more soporific if it came with an associated PowerPoint presentation.</p> <p>It is in the confrontations with Dano, himself not averse to a touch of fruitiness, where things go badly awry. The culmination is, of course, the “milkshake” scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOEYT0wZFNg\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOEYT0wZFNg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Plainview drinks his milkshake</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here, almost 30 years on from the film’s start, a rich, drink-soaked Plainview accosts and wrestles a whimpering Eli around a bowling alley. Yes, a bowling alley. But this is not before hobbling around like a demented Richard III, pointing his finger into a straw shape and yelling a slightly confused metaphor about dairy-based beverages, ending with the infamous, much-mocked line, “I drink your milkshake!” and a scenery-shaking “Sluuuurrp!” noise.</p> <p>It might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema – Crash still has that tied up – but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance.</p> <p>My personal theory is that Anderson later realised the folly of his ways and so half remade his tale of charismatic sociopaths and their damaged, younger sidekicks/nemeses as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\">The Master</a>.</p> <p>The big difference, of course, is that this film had at its heart the much-mourned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, an actor, like Day-Lewis, also capable of energy and rage, but also blessed with lightness, subtlety, grace, humanity, an ability to know when to hog the spotlight and when to edge back.

Astronaut Chris Hadfield appeared on talk shows, <a href=\"http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/12/chris-hadfield-says-sandra-bullocks-underwear-in-gravity-were-all-wrong-video/\">besmirching Sandra Bullock’s choice of underwear</a>. Alan Evans, in this space on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/gravity-my-most-overrated-film\">named Gravity as the most overrated film of all time</a>. This despite the existence of The Dark Knight Rises. Surely that can’t be right.</p> <p> Perhaps sensing that consensus is starting to slip against it a little, the producers of Gravity have decided to release a new version designed to show the film in the most realistic way possible. The new diamond luxe version of Gravity comes with the option to turn off Steven Price’s Oscar-winning score entirely, allowing viewers to experience the ostensibly realistic thundering silence of space. Whether or not that’s something that anyone would actually want to do is another matter, since the score – especially the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\">ethereal Sigur R</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\">ó</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\">s thrum of Aningaaq</a>, playing during a scene so vital that it received its own spin-off short – is one of the film’s best assets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUb1k2vbXqU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUb1k2vbXqU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p> Either way, it’s becoming quite fashionable to muck around with a film’s soundtrack. Back in 2005, the Australian band the New Pollutants premiered a new score for Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, to moderately successful effect. And just last month, Radio 1’s Zane Lowe rescored Drive for a BBC3 broadcast; a move that only really succeeded in turning Nicolas Winding Refn’s studious passivity into a slightly more emotionally on-the-nose extended advert for bomber jackets.</p> <p>But perhaps there’s something in both replacing a film’s score and removing it entirely. If anyone with the talent and the inclination happens to be reading, here are the rescores I’d most like to see.<br /></p> <h2>Titanic</h2> <p>If any film deserves the Gravity Diamond Luxe treatment, it’s this. Imagine how much better it’d be with no score at all. All the early scenes – from the dinner, to the love scene, to “King of the world” – would be so much better if they were accompanied only by the plaintive slap of water on metal. And then, obviously, the last third of the film would contain nothing but creaking metal and screaming, something much more in tune with my ambient internal commentary than anything James Horner could compose. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tuvz_9D7Ok\">No Celine Dion either</a>, which frankly is a massive bonus.</p> <h2>Jurassic Park</h2> <p>I’d love to see if the iconic scene where the humans first clap eyes on the dinosaurs would be as majestic without John Williams’ soaring theme. Based on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynlk9K1psFg\">infamous melodica cover version</a>, I doubt it. Also, without all that music, we’d probably get to hear a dinosaur fart. That’d be fun.<br /></p> <h2>Mission: Impossible II</h2> <p>It goes without saying that Limp Bizkit’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdpP6ynPbiY\">whiny poor-me rap</a> contributes hugely to the dismal quality of this film. Let’s replace all trace of them with something less offensive, like the sound of crying children or dentist drills or distant screaming. Anything, really.</p> <h2>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJCN3Mhr14\">See above</a>.<br /></p> <h2>Vanishing Point</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ\">Yaketty Sax</a>. All the way through. All the way through.<br /></p> <p> What do you think? Are film scores untouchable pieces of art, or would you welcome a tinker? Any films that you’d like to see rescored?

If it had been the true event movie its press and marketing set it up as, it would have beaten animation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/big-hero-6\">Big Hero 6</a> to the US top spot. Instead, $46.7m makes it director Christopher Nolan’s weakest opening since 2006’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-prestige\">The Prestige</a>. The reasons: a November release that preps the film for awards season, but remote from the big-money summer slots; the 169-minute run time; and a fortnight of intensive press coverage designed to butter up Nolan’s reputation as the mainstream king of our times, but which has sown the seeds of a backlash.<br /></p> <p> Overseas box-office takings of $82.9m (£52.3m) looks like an ample makeweight, containing the expected array of No 1 openings, including a beefy $14.1m in South Korea that puts it in the country’s top 10 highest ever. But considering the scale of the rollout – 63 territories – $83m is middling for a film that thinks it belongs in the A-league. The two films in the year’s current top five that opened lower overseas – Guardians of the Galaxy ($66.4m from 32 markets) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($75.2m from 27 markets) – would have easily beaten Interstellar if they’d set up shop in an equivalent number of territories. In terms of November openings, Interstellar is short of something like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95856/matrix.revolutions\">The Matrix Revolutions</a>, whose initial overseas take was $117.6m in 2003 – though franchise branding surely played a part there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/07/interstellar-leviathan-say-when-the-possibilities-are-endless-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/435z8\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2189114\"                data-video-name=\"The Guardian Film Show: Interstellar, Leviathan, Say When and The Possibilities are Endless - video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/7/1415368043429/Matthew-McConaughey-and-A-024.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451498003\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/7/1415368040422/Matthew-McConaughey-and-A-022.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar/141106TGFSInterstellar.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The film-show team review Interstellar</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bluntly put, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/10/big-hero-6-interstellar-us-box-office\">Interstellar opted to play high stakes</a>, leveraging a massive opening at an off-peak time of year on the back of Nolan’s august reputation. The danger is that the film hasn’t lived up to it, and that drop-off could now be steep, with China (12 Nov) and Japan (22 Nov) the only major markets in reserve. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\">Gravity</a>, Interstellar’s main autumn-release comparison point, opened fairly quietly abroad ($28.4m), but a gradually widening rollout saw word-of-mouth about its groundbreaking visuals build that figure week by week. In its favour, Interstellar has been tracking strongly among the over-25s who might watch the film at their leisure in the coming weeks. But it seems unlikely to kindle Gravity’s repeat-business spark, which took it to $716.4m worldwide, or to match Nolan’s $825.5m for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inception\">Inception</a> in 2010. $500m-ish looks like a better bet. Fun historical fact: Interstellar’s mothership film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> managed close to that just in US domestic on its original release, if you correct for inflation ($56.9m/$389.2m adjusted). <br /></p> <h2>The runner-up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-628c6b37-a097-46ef-b19a-6d34a0cc6df4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415788471162/5cdfe078-4d08-4a66-a70c-b9d90f54975f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Big Hero 6\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cute challenger Big Hero 6.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/LFI/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disney can be proud of more than just keeping Interstellar in its rear-view mirror. Its new animation, Big Hero 6, is its second-best non-Pixar opening ($56.2m), behind the all-conquering Frozen, which built on a good-but-not-spectacular $67.4m start to become the most successful animated film ever. Big Hero 6, <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=computeranimation.htm&amp;sort=opengross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm\">the 23rd best debut for a CGI animation</a>, draws on the back catalogue of Marvel characters the studio now has at its disposal for its tale of prodigy Hiro Hamada, his inflatable robot sidekick, and the superhero squad they assemble. Looking at Big Hero 6’s wider prospects, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen\">Frozen</a>’s $1.27bn worldwide gross is probably setting the bar too high. But if the film can connect even half as much in Japan – to whom its anime stylings are surely beckoning – then $500m-plus and a place in the yearly top 10 is eminently achievable. No 1 openings this past weekend in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia bode well for its Asian prospects, with Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore coming next frame, in advance of a long rollout stretching into 2015.<br /></p> <h2>Still not Gone </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/02/gone-girl-ben-affleck-video-interview\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4247v\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2168235\"                data-video-name=\"Gone Girl star Ben Affleck: 'Usually the protagonist is full of shit' - video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/1/1412183020300/Gone-Girl-star-Ben-Afflec-021.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-448657885\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/1/1412183017153/Gone-Girl-star-Ben-Afflec-019.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/01/141001Affleck-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/01/141001Affleck_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/01/141001Affleck/141001Affleck.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/01/141001Affleck_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/01/141001Affleck.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Ben Affleck talks about Gone Girl</figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Fincher’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl\">Gone Girl</a> has passed $300m globally, a testimony to undeniable staying power in the key developed-world territories most in tune with its modern-marriage autopsy, like the UK ($33.4m and counting), Australia ($20.7m), France and South Korea (where it rose by 6.5% on its second weekend). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher\">Fincher</a> broke his own US domestic record some time ago, and is now within touching distance of a worldwide personal best, tantalisingly at hand with Japanese (12 Dec) and Italian (18 Dec) bows to come. Not bad at all, considering Gone Girl doesn’t quite boast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558621,00.html\">Se7en</a>’s ($327.3m) shock factor (nor an emerging Brad Pitt) and, unlike the family-friendly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button\">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a> ($333.9m), is an 18 certificate. Pass those two, and Fincher will be nesting behind the far-more-expensive End of Tomorrow and Noah in the end-of-year list – perhaps the only non-youth/young adult title in the top 25. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/life-of-pi\">Life of Pi</a> ($609m, 11th place) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wolf-of-wall-street\">Wolf of Wall Street </a>($392m, 17th place) managed a similar feat in 2012 and 2013.<br /></p> <h2>The rest of the world</h2> <p>Three Chinese releases propped up the lower reaches of this week’s chart. K-pop idol Rain, previously seen in the Wachowski siblings’ Speed Racer and Ninja Assassin, made his Chinese film debut opposite Liu Yifei in rich-kids romance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1sv-Iu6-Zg\">For Love or Money</a>. That brought in $4.8m, well behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, still lodged in that country’s top spot. Donnie Yen’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0HP6S9vHr8\">Kung Fu Jungle</a> – also playing in Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and elsewhere – added another $4m (16th globally) to bring it to $14m; it seems destined to be minor Yen, unless it gets a US release, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences\">martial arts reliably brings in the African-American crowd</a>. Suspense thriller <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWkLhQLdo88\">The Boundary Line</a> crept in 17th globally, with $2.7m at the weekend; it follows a pair of men – one played by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Zhao\">Vincent Zhao</a>, who replaced Jet Li in the Once Upon a Time in China series – stumbling on a dark secret while tracking down missing loved ones.<br /></p> <h2>The future</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b5f0d36a-cdda-487b-8f5a-fbe2823fe0a5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415788884089/14d19607-5120-4c81-b064-1246ef8ab9dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Penguins of Madagascar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penguins of Madagascar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interstellar pops out of the wormhole midweek in China, not only eager to reinforce Christopher Nolan’s international push, but also – as one of the country’s annual quota of 14 Imax/3D releases – top up this week’s $20.9m Imax takings (a November record). But cute things could plague it there, too: Madagascar spin-off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjfID263ViI\">Penguins of Madagascar</a> opens early on the 14th to avoid the December local-film deluge, and the last Madagascar did a decent $31m in China. Johnnie To’s romantic comedy sequel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9diSL92ME\">Don’t Go Breaking My Heart 2</a> – a change from the director’s usual gangster fare – also enters the fray. The sole big international opening is the return of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as knuckle-dragging duo Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to\">Dumb and Dumber To</a>, unspooling in about 30 markets, including the US. It’s been an unbelievable 20 years since the original: a test for the new franchise and for Carrey, who hasn’t fronted a major hit since 2003’s Bruce Almighty.</p> <h2>Top 10 global box office, 7-9 November</h2> <p>1.

href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29988900\">reports the BBC</a>.</p> <p>Mudblood and the Book of Spells will focus on a muggle-born wizard who is expelled from Hogwarts School of ​Witchcraft and ​Wizardry for retaliating against bullies. Producers have shot ​a promotional ​trailer,​ and hope to start filming in the new year.</p> <p>Manchester film ​student Cameron Cairnduff will direct the 30-minute not-for-profit film, which stars Bretten Lord in the lead role of Charlie and has also recruited Game of Thrones actor Forbes KB to play an unspecified part. The film-makers ​started a one-month campaign on the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1521374935/mudblood-and-the-book-of-spells-hp-fan-film\">crowdfunding site Kickstarter in a bid to raise the movie’s £40,000</a>​. At ​the time of publication they had secured £2,649 from 66 backers. There are 19 days left to donate.<br /></p> <p>“We want to make something people will want to watch and we want to create our own [job] opportunities,” Cairnduff told the BBC. “There are no good Harry Potter fan films – they’re all American, and have low production values.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1af5341b7a215093b59847dd1c18bfe9188e1d07\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415792440490/7398f42e-ef96-4541-b5fa-60e63d4d0580-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>​Warner Bros, the studio behind the Harry Potter films, has its own big-budget followup planned to the highest-grossing film saga of all time, the JK Rowling-penned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them\">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a>. However, fan films usually fly under the radar with ​entertainment lawyers due to their low-budget, not-for-profit nature.</p> <p>A synopsis for <a href=\"http://www.mudbloodmovie.com/\">Mudblood and the Book of Spells</a> reads: “We join Charlie, a young muggle-born ​wizard, as he embarks on an adventure that will change him forever. After being unfairly condemned and imprisoned by the Ministry for crimes he did not commit, Charlie taps into a power deep inside himself and manages to break free. Now a fugitive, he is befriended by a band of unseemly Wizards who need his help to recover an art​efact so ancient and powerful it will bring the Wizarding World to its knees.”</p> <p>The fan film is being shot with the help of students from Futureworks ​School of Media in Salford, ​which Cairnduff ​attends, as well as volunteers from other local universities and the Royal Northern College of Music​. The screenplay has been written with input from users of the fan sites Pottermore and Muggle​Net. The aim is to shoot at outside locations across northern England in January, with premieres in Manchester and London by the end of 2015.</p> <p>• <a

A lovey-dovey rom-com with crackerjack casting and an authentic indie setting bewitched moviegoers into believing that it had a never-ending supply of onions worth peeling. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/silver-linings-playbook\">Silver Linings Playbook</a>’s own aggressive assertion that it is refreshingly unique and cutting edge isn’t enough to cover up how cookie-cutter it really is. The magic has worn thin, and not even an adorably foul-mouthed Jennifer Lawrence can clean up this self-assured serving of predictability. </p> <p>Silver Linings Playbook follows the blossoming relationship between Pat (Bradley Cooper) and his troubled neighbour Tiffany (Lawrence) as they get to grips with their respective broken hearts. Bipolar Pat has returned to his parent’s home after a stint in a psychiatric ward, having beaten his ex-wife’s lover within an inch of his life. Tiffany has lost her husband in a car accident, escaping the pain through sexual encounters with her work colleagues. They’re a perfect match because they’re damaged goods – because they’re <em>real</em> – because they refuse to take any flak from Tiffany’s sister (Julia Stiles), who embodies middle-American traditional sensibilities. The pair go on to spend two hours struggling to catch a glimpse of life’s silver lining, only to realise, through the power of dance montages and illegal betting, that they are each other’s everlasting treasures. <em>Fin</em>. Insert understated heart-warming pre-credits couch snuggle here. </p> <p>Sadly, Pat, our supremely selfish protagonist, is the only truly fleshed-out character in the film. The two-dimensional supporting cast of mother, father, brother, psychologist and love interest act only as mirrors by which Pat can take a hard look at himself and “remake” who he is as a man. The problem with Pat is that, as he goes through the motions, he becomes increasingly unlikable. We can appreciate how mood swings and hyper highs are an overpowering part of bipolar disorder, but what lies at his core is far more irritating – his true self. And while the journey of the antihero is all too celebrated at the moment, something tells me that this movie wants you root for Pat, not feel the urge to smother him with his garbage-bag poncho. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2012/nov/20/bradley-cooper-silver-linings-playbook-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3cvcb\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1830854\"                data-video-name=\"Bradley Cooper on Silver Linings Playbook: 'We're not free from the mysticism of life' - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-399646072\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/11/19/121119SilverLinings_6921608.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/20/121119SilverLinings-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/11/19/121119SilverLinings-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121119SilverLinings/121119SilverLinings.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/20/121119SilverLinings_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/20/121119SilverLinings_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Intermixed with lingering closeups of objects that seemingly contain substance, like lonely ballet flats in an empty dance studio, are loose themes of the human plight to nurture the positivity the world offers to us. This relentless spoon-feeding becomes old fast. One particularly average offering comes from the lips of Tiffany, who manages a direct reference to Golding’s Lord of the Flies and the film’s own title in the one outburst: “And then there’s a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they’re really mean, and then there’s a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there’s no silver lining.”</p> <p>One of the tricks Silver Linings Playbook uses to cloak its formulaic, arthritic bones is a deceptively fresh angle that attempts to render it relevant to the modern-day consciousness, being that of the scarily destructive nature of mental illness. Rather than acting as a tool to unearth the fragility of the human psyche, the effect is the equivalent to Dirty Dancing if Johnny Castle was crippled by, say, Tourette syndrome. Despite this, audiences still gobbled up this story because it was quirky – because it was kooky – because it celebrated letting your freak flag fly. A closeup of Tiffany’s non-conformist black nail polish will jackhammer that into your head for you. As will Pat’s rebellious ordering of Raisin Bran on their first non-date, or their left-of-centre public rock-out to the White Stripes. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c13dcd0dc43ddc607821d2f5d598447f7aaf501b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415793803070/44d59893-43c5-4cd0-94c0-4c75574238fe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills / Rex Features/Snap Stills / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing as the film tackles the stranglehold mental illness can have on a person and their ultimate outlook on life, its integrity seems ​based on this alone, stealing focus from the painfully lame points of the piece. Mental illness in the 2010s is what prosthetic noses; weight gain and monster-size uglification were in the noughties. But should this treatment of challenging subject matter really allow Silver Linings Playbook to tower over the rest, especially when it schools its audience on the fact that there’s nothing like finding one new love to replace another, and there’s nothing like love to cure any debilitating mental illness? </p> <p>Even though Silver Linings Playbook reeks of a tried-and-tested equation and glides into a resolution that you could see coming from the film’s trailer, it’s neatly paced and rings true in many instances. Having the entire family’s fortune riding on one single amateur dance performance, thanks to Tiffany’s instigation of a verbally binding bet is not one of them. And this example demonstrates why the film shouldn’t be taken as seriously as it takes itself. Doing so will only contribute to hype that isn’t sufficiently earned. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/most-overrated-films\">More most overrated films</a><br /></li> <li><a

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-2\">The Inbetweeners 2</a> three months ago, Interstellar tops the chart with a weekend gross greater than the films in second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth places all added together. However, the £5.38m opening is down on the £5.91m debut of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inception\">Inception</a>, from July 2010. The Inception comparison is apt, since both these Christopher Nolan films are based on original ideas, rather than benefiting from audience interest in established characters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-dark-knight-rises\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> – a less suitable comparison – debuted here with £14.36m in July 2012.</p> <p>Distributor Warners will point to the running time of Interstellar (169 minutes) putting a brake on box office: cinemas have more limited opportunities to squeeze in two evening showtimes with a film of such epic duration. On the other hand, multiplexes can simply programme on more screens to get round the problem. Inception came in at a relatively trim 148 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/03/matthew-mcconaughey-christopher-nolan-interstellar-video-interview\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43xz2\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2186192\"                data-video-name=\"Matthew McConaughey and the cast of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar: 'Mother nature's going to be just fine, it's us that might not be' - video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/3/1415019640177/Matthew-McConaughey-talks-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451198918\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/3/1415019638815/Matthew-McConaughey-talks-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar/141103Interstellar.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Matthew McConaughey and the cast of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar: ‘Mother nature’s going to be just fine, it’s us that might not be’ - video interview </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interstellar opened on exactly the same date as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\">Gravity</a> a year ago – another Imax-friendly cerebral space adventure from a commercial auteur director. Gravity debuted with £6.24m, including £619,000 in previews, going on to achieve a robust £27.1m by year’s end, and £32.7m by the end of its run.

That’s already more than the lifetime gross of any previous Mike Leigh film.</p> <p>Distributor eOne is following an aggressive strategy never tried before with a Mike Leigh title, expanding in week two to a hefty 252 cinemas. That of course means that the screen average on the second weekend has diluted – but at £4,026 it’s still an attractive number. More cinemas, evidently, are clamouring to take the film, and Mr Turner expands its site count to 380 from Friday.</p> <p>Among venues Mr Turner expanded into, best-performing were Bluewater Showcase, Vue Plymouth, The Quad in Derby and Eastbourne Cineworld. Overall, after 10 days, Odeon has highest market share on the film, and the Olympic Barnes is the biggest-grossing site. Following more of a London/South-east skew on opening weekend, eOne reports that the business is spreading more regionally as the run progresses. Now that the film is at more than 250 venues, multiplex sites outnumber arthouses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/vera-drake\">Vera Drake</a> (£2.38m lifetime) is the only other Mike Leigh film to crack £2m in the UK. Secrets &amp; Lies, Happy Go Lucky, Another Year and Topsy-Turvy all landed in the £1-2m range. With Mr Turner performing strongly on weekdays as well as at the weekend, it’s reasonable to assume that £5m is now a very safe bet for the title. Bafta nominations in the new year could extend the film’s life into January and February. Including Monday takings, Mr Turner now has an 11-day cume of £2.86m.</p> <h2>The rival newcomers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/07/interstellar-leviathan-say-when-the-possibilities-are-endless-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/435z8\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2189114\"                data-video-name=\"The Guardian Film Show: Interstellar, Leviathan, Say When and The Possibilities are Endless - video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/7/1415368043429/Matthew-McConaughey-and-A-024.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451498003\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/7/1415368040422/Matthew-McConaughey-and-A-022.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar/141106TGFSInterstellar.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/07/141106TGFSInterstellar.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The Guardian Film Show: Interstellar, Leviathan, Say When and The Possibilities are Endless - video reviews</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thanks to the release of Interstellar, studios gave the weekend date a wide berth, at least for any film with hope of significant commercial achievement. But a few more modestly proportioned titles were given a run, notably US indie comedy Say When, starring Keira Knightley, Sam Rockwell and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film debuted in 12th place, with a mediocre £93,000 from 122 cinemas. But that number looks positively rosy compared to the gross achieved by The Skeleton Twins, starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader: £19,200 from 85 venues, and a dismal £226 average.</p> <p>Despite having a cast topped by Pierce Brosnan, Disney took an ultra-cautious approach to its new spy thriller The November Man, placing it in just 12 cinemas. A gross of just under £5,000 resulted, yielding a £415 average. With a production budget reported at $15m, Disney evidently decided there was no point trying to recoup any of this cost from the UK theatrical market. Doubtless a happier fate awaits the film on DVD and via another ancillary revenue streams.</p> <h2>The documentary glut</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/sep/16/the-possibilities-are-endless-trailer-stroke-edwyn-collins-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4xtz2\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2159219\"                data-video-name=\"The Possibilities are Endless: world exclusive trailer for Edwyn Collins's post-stroke documentary - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/16/1410867153754/Edwyn-Collins-in-a-still--014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-447313678\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/16/1410867152391/Edwyn-Collins-in-a-still--013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/09/16/140916Possibilities-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/09/16/140916Possibilities/140916Possibilities.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/09/16/140916Possibilities_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/09/16/140916Possibilities.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/09/16/140916Possibilities_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The Possibilities are Endless: world exclusive trailer for Edwyn Collins’s post-stroke documentary - video </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five feature-length documentaries appear in the “Other openers chart”, below, including films about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-possibilities-are-endless\">singer Edwyn Collins</a>, film-maker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/kingdom-of-dreams-and-madness-review-studio-ghibli\">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-case-against-8\">equal marriage in California</a>. In addition, two further documentary titles, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/algorithms-film-review-blind-chess-india\">Algorithms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/one-rogue-reporter-review-steve-coogan-hugh-grant\">One Rogue Reporter</a>, were listed as official 7 November releases by the UK Film Distributors Association, and were both reviewed by UK newspaper critics, including in the Guardian. Neither appear in Rentrak’s weekend box-office report. The seven documentaries grossed a collective £10,200, including previews.</p> <p>Digital screens and flexible programming have allowed documentaries to be given more of a theatrical life than was the case in former times. In the equivalent weekend 10 years ago – when a typical cinema release would occupy all the showtimes every day in a screen it occupied – there was only one documentary released in cinemas: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101484/end.of.the.century\">End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones</a>. The comparison is mentioned not out of nostalgia for such scant programming – but present-day audiences may be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed with choice, especially when there are as many documentaries reaching cinemas as there are days in the week.</p> <h2>The future</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/06/the-imitation-game-watch-benedict-cumberbatch-as-alan-turing-in-the-oscar-tipped-biopic-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/434zq\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2188403\"                data-video-name=\"The Imitation Game: watch Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing in the Oscar-tipped biopic - video exclusive\"                data-video-provider=\"StudioCanal\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/6/1415280432762/Benedict-Cumberbatch-as-A-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451426700\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/6/1415280430366/Benedict-Cumberbatch-as-A-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame/141106ImitationGame.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/06/141106ImitationGame_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The Imitation Game: watch Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing - video exclusive</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the arrival of Interstellar, takings are nevertheless 21% down on the equivalent weekend from last year, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\">Gravity</a> arrived in the top spot, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thor-the-dark-world\">Thor: The Dark World</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philomena\">Philomena</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-phillips\">Captain Phillips</a> offered robust support.

In fact, most critics had liked it (<a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gravity_2013/\">it still has 97% on Rotten Tomatoes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gravity\">a score of 96 on Metacritic</a>). Many of my friends had raved about it, and space is pretty cool, so I went. And it was terrible.</p> <p>The plot can be boiled down to one sentence: “Unhappy woman has bad time in space but survives against the odds.” Sandra Bullock’s character, Ryan Stone, floats from one mishap to another, always escaping disaster at the last possible moment. </p> <p>In order to provide breathing space between the disaster set pieces, Stone is provided with a saccharine, implausible backstory full of sledgehammer symbolism. Her daughter fell over, hit her head and died – because of gravity (wait, that’s the name of the film? No way!). So she goes into space, presumably to defy gravity. With no training as an astronaut, she manages to get a job as a “mission specialist” on a space station – and things soon go horribly wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/sep/06/gravity-trailer-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3thn5\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1961636\"                data-video-name=\"Gravity: watch Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the new full-length trailer of the space-walk thriller - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Bros\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/6/1378479707064/Gravity-trailer-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-416689780\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/6/1378479707064/Gravity-trailer-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer_vpx.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer/130906GravityTrailer.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/9/6/130906GravityTrailer_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Many reviewers and commentators have praised it as a rare example of a strong female lead character in a Hollywood movie. But they must have been watching a different film, because Gravity embraces all sorts of gender stereotypes. Often clueless, Stone is the very model of the damsel in distress. She is repeatedly rescued, but always by men or by chance – she never escape catastrophe thanks to her own ingenuity. Plus, there are more unnecessary lingering shots of Bullock in her underwear than you’d find of models in a Pirelli calendar.</p> <p>Gravity is not designed as a comedy, but at times it is difficult not to laugh. The most notable of these is the utterly ludicrous deus ex machina scene in which Stone’s dead colleague, played by George Clooney, appears in a hallucination and conveniently tells her exactly which buttons to press to escape, reminds her that life is worth living, and then disappears. </p> <p>Even 1990s Steven Spielberg would be embarrassed by the level of sentimentality, and Steven Price’s this-is-where-you-cry score certainly doesn’t help in this regard. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46GwvQHmOs\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f46GwvQHmOs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>“Nobody ever taught me how to pray,” Stone tells us at one point. She also beseeches Clooney’s ghost to say hello to her dead daughter: “You tell her that I love her, Matt. You tell her that I love her so much. Can you do that for me?” After years of production and untold millions of dollars spent on special effects, couldn’t Alfonso Cuarón have given someone a few quid to spend half an hour casting their eyes over the script and removing a few of the cliches?</p> <p>However technically impressive it might be, 3D technology is no substitute for a good story. Having a metal bolt appear to fall towards me is just showing off (not to mention inexplicable to those watching in 2D). If I want to be wowed just by 3D effects, I’ll go to a theme-park simulator game and watch monsters jump out at me and clowns fall off ladders. And if I want clumsy homages to 2001: A Space Odyssey, I’ll head to a sixth-form college short-film night.</p> <p>Still, a lot of these problems could be forgiven if Gravity didn’t commit the worst sin of all: being intensely boring. I’m not remotely invested in what happens to any of the astronauts. The most likable character is the Inuit fisherman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\">Aningaaq</a>, who Stone contacts by radio. In fact, Gravity co-writer Jonás Cuarón’s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\"> short film about Aningaaq</a> has more depth in seven minutes than the feature film manages in a tedious 90 minutes. The film finally became interesting in the final scene. I’d much rather watch a movie about what happens to Ryan Stone after – <strong>spoiler alert!</strong> – she returns to Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcYkuIzzy8\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zcYkuIzzy8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Escape against the odds is an appealing story, but only when it contains nuance, surprise and ambiguity. For example, JC Chandor’s film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/all-is-lost\">All Is Lost</a>, released a month after Gravity, is essentially the same plot, but set on the sea. It deals with the same issues of solitude and the value of life in a far more interesting way because Chandor doesn’t spoon-feed emotion to his audience the way Cuarón does.</p> <p>I couldn’t care less about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/08/gravity-science-astrophysicist\">scientific inaccuracies</a>, and I don’t begrudge Gravity its many awards. The technical wizardry is brilliant, and it’s great that the sound-mixing team have been recognised. Good job! It’s not your fault the film’s so dull. But Gravity is the cinematic equivalent of a drum solo. Technical prowess is nice, but it isn’t what counts when it comes to entertainment. Great films live or die on the strength of their stories, and Gravity barely even has one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

screening in LA was assaulted with self-defence spray by the angry woman on Monday night, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/11/10/man-maced-at-movie-theater-for-asking-someone-to-turn-off-their-cell-phone/\" title=\"\">reports Mashable</a>.</p> <p>During an American Film Institute screening of Mike Leigh’s biopic Mr Turner at the Chinese theatre in Hollywood, the man repeatedly said: “Excuse me sir, could you please turn off your screen?” After failing to attract the attention of the woman, whom he had apparently mistaken for a man, the filmgoer tapped her on the shoulder. The woman allegedly turned around, accused the man of hitting her and threatened to call the police.</p> <p>After a minute’s standoff, during which the male filmgoer calmly defended his actions while the woman shone her phone’s flashlight in his face and other attendees rebuked her, the attacker reached into her bag and sprayed the man in the eyes. “Everyone in the audience was watching in disbelief,” <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/woman-sprays-man-with-mace-during-afi-screening-1201353075/\" title=\"\">an eyewitness told Variety</a>.</p> <p>The victim and his female companion left the cinema, but the attacker watched Mr Turner for another 15 to 20 minutes before security escorted her from the premises.

asked to comment on criticism of his film’s depiction of interplanetary space travel. Both professional and amateur critics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/05/interstellar-astrophysics-does-space-science-work-out\">including astrophysics professor Dr Roberto Trotta, of Imperial College London</a>, have hinted that the film has as many plot holes as wormholes, but Nolan said he was comfortable with Interstellar’s scientific credibility. “My films are always held to a weirdly high standard … [that] isn’t applied to everybody else’s films, which I’m fine with,” said Nolan. “People are always accusing my films of having plot holes. And I’m very aware of the plot holes in my films and very aware of when people spot them – but they generally don’t.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/03/matthew-mcconaughey-christopher-nolan-interstellar-video-interview\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2186192\"                data-video-name=\"Matthew McConaughey and the cast of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar: 'Mother nature's going to be just fine, it's us that might not be' - video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/3/1415019640177/Matthew-McConaughey-talks-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-451198918\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/3/1415019638815/Matthew-McConaughey-talks-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/03/141103Interstellar/141103Interstellar.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The cast of Interstellar talk to Catherine Shoard</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film-maker worked closely with theoretical physicist Dr Kip Thorne when developing Interstellar. Nolan admitted “cheating” on the science for the sake of the audience’s enjoyment on occasion, but said critics should read Thorne’s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Science-Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378\">The Science of Interstellar</a>.<br /></p> <p>One criticism from multiple quarters has been the film’s suggestion that during one hour that Nolan’s astronaut visits the exoplanets seven hours would pass on Earth. “That’s completely accurate,” the British director said. “Those issues are all buttoned-up,” he added, saying that Thorne’s book about the film distinguishes between the accurate science and the speculation.</p> <p>Nolan added: “There have been a bunch of knee-jerk tweets by people who’ve only seen the film once, but to really take on the science of the film, you’re going to need to sit down with the film for a bit and probably also read Kip’s book.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a boost to his scientific credibility, the tech magazine Wired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/interstellar-director-christopher-nolan-to-guest-edit-wired-magazine\">announced that Nolan will guest-edit its December issue</a>, following in the footsteps of film-makers such as James Cameron and JJ Abrams.</p>","headline":"Interstellar science 'deliberately speculative' says Christopher

The first of two films adapted from the final book of Suzanne Collins’s bestselling Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay – Part 1, is a multimillion dollar stopgap. Director Francis Lawrence ekes a paltry story out. The special effects are limp and the script a little creaky, although somehow it still manages to thrill.</p> <p>Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen, the victor of the Hunger Games, a brutal television show in which teens from districts across a future America (known as Panem) are pitted against one another in a fight to the death. Having been rescued from her second series, Katniss is in hiding with a rebel faction who want to take the fight to the Capitol, the bastion of Panem’s cruel autocrat, President Snow (Donald Sutherland).</p> <p>Like any good reality TV star Katniss has her backstage team. In the earlier films they were on hand to make her look and act like a Hunger Games winner. Now they’re crafting her into the model firebrand: the Mockingjay. Her hair, her uniform, her politics – all have to be carefully sculpted to appeal to the masses.</p> <p>And this time the revolution will be advertised. Katniss’s PR man, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman, in his final role), coaches her in the art of “Propos” – propaganda designed to sway the hearts and minds of the people. But Katniss is a lousy actor, so Plutarch sends her out into the world with a camera crew, to react to the devastation wrought by the Capitol, live.</p> <p>Franchises get rebooted, but they don’t normally get rebooted halfway through their run. Without the Hunger Games themselves the film lacks a solid structure. Katniss spends much of the film finding her strength after the abduction of her boyfriend, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). The rebels admire her anger and defiance, they’re probably not so keen on her boy-centric fretting.</p> <p>Mockingjay has pace, but Lawrence has none of the flair of original Hunger Games director Gary Ross, who captured the genuine terror of being trapped inside a game of kill-or-be-killed. The gaudy pizzazz of The Capitol, with its Flock of Seagulls inspired fashions and tasteless revelry, is absent. We spend almost all of our time down in the dark with the rebels.</p> <p>In the Wachowski siblings’ Matrix trilogy the imaginary world of The Matrix was limitlessly exciting, while the “real-life” underground city of Zion was muddy and miserable. Similarly, life on (or under) the ground in Panem is a grind. In contrast President Snow’s baroque sense of cruelty is rather appealing. He bombs the rebel base, packing his munitions with white roses as a personal message to Katniss. He’s evil – undoubtedly – but he’s evil with style.</p> <p>Rebel Katniss is somehow less fun than the woman Stanley Tucci’s TV host labelled The Girl on Fire. Yet she must fight on against the Capitol. Panem demands it. The franchise demands it more. Mockingjay – Part 2 will round out the action this time next year. In the meantime Part 1 is a likeable preamble, a moment to let the flames die down before adding more fuel. “Fire is catching!” yells Katniss. Yes, but it’s taking its time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/hunger-games-mockingjay-donald-sutherland-jennifer-lawrence\">• News: Donald Sutherland says he hopes film will galvanise young voters<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/nov/11/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-premiere-in-pictures\">• Gallery: the premiere in pictures</a></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on Tuesday 11 November 2014 to correct the spelling of director Francis Lawrence’s name. <br /></li> </ul>","headline":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 review – revolution will be advertised","trailText":"Director Francis Lawrence manages to thrill despite working with a thin story, creaky script and limp special effects","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415711423893/9d1aa311-e9f4-4112-bcbc-274c460c7514-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"568","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Henry Barnes","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-14T00:01:10Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-one-film-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/11/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-one-film-review","tags":[{"id":"film/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1","webTitle":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/donald-sutherland","webTitle":"Donald Sutherland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/donald-sutherland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/donald-sutherland","references":[]},{"id":"film/jennifer-lawrence","webTitle":"Jennifer Lawrence","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/jennifer-lawrence","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/henrybarnes","webTitle":"Henry Barnes","r2ContributorId":"19723","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/1/21/1358772912329/Guardian-film-staff-membe-003.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"barnes","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Henry Barnes is the site editor of theguardian.com/film.

picked five on-screen cerebral breakthroughs, and want to know which you would choose for your own list</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Geniuses in films can be pretty annoying. They’re often asocial, smug and prone to zoning out to soundtracks of soaring classical music, as they solve complicated mathematical problems that the rest of us could never hope to understand. </p> <p>Given Benedict Cumberbatch’s turn as codebreaking mathematician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing\">Alan Turing</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/08/the-imitation-game-review-script-fails-to-sizzle\">The Imitation Game</a>, out this weekend in the UK, we’ve set our reservations aside and picked five on-screen aha moments. Which films you would add to the list? </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/90285/beautiful.mind\">A Beautiful Mind</a></h2> <p>Russell Crowe shed his gruff, bad-boy image for this 2001 role as soft-spoken Nobel laureate John Nash. Before spiralling into a battle with paranoid schizophrenia and enduring experimental shock therapy treatments for his illness, Nash flourished at Princeton university. In this scene, he landed upon his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium\">Nash equilibrium</a> theory, in the rather unlikely setting of a bar meat market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d_dtTZQyUM\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2d_dtTZQyUM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/69596/good-will-hunting\">Good Will Hunting</a></h2> <p>Matt Damon played a janitor by day and “mystery math magician” by night in the critically acclaimed film he co-wrote with buddy Ben Affleck. While this scene doesn’t fully explode into the usual trope of illuminated numbers flashing across the genius’s line of sight, there’s a nice ratio of string-section tension-building to frenzied blackboard scribbling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7b0cLn-wHU\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7b0cLn-wHU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Little Man Tate</h2> <p>Jodie Foster’s directorial debut slipped into slightly hamfisted genius territory, in this 1991 tale of a prodigal schoolboy living in a world that just doesn’t<em> get </em>him. But it’s hard to be snarky about an adorable protagonist who was only seven years old, so we’ve included this display of character Fred Tate’s ridiculous computation skills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfJVDiX3Bt4\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfJVDiX3Bt4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108736/proof\">Proof</a></h2> <p>Jake Gyllenhaal starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins in this story about a once-lauded mathematician’s crumbling sanity – and the daughter who’s lived in his shadow for her entire life. But look! There’s a room in their family home full of notebooks with gibberish scrawled in them. And one of them contains a proof that might change the world. Eureka, indeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnvy9q4UpZw\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pnvy9q4UpZw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76492/back-to-the-future-part-ii\">Back to the Future Part II</a></h2> <p>Dr Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, fully embodied his mad scientist role in the Back to the Future franchise. It’s likely he experienced enough jolting epiphanies to fill this entire list alone, but this one in particular beautifully caught the film’s balance between absurd humour and life-or-death breathlessness. Surely we wouldn’t want the future of the world, time travel and all, in anyone else’s capable hands but his?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKqd27h7KjM\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKqd27h7KjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>","headline":"Clip joint: genius epiphanies","trailText":"<strong>Tshepo Mokoena</strong> picks her top five ‘eureka!’ moments from the movies","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415638668126/9d84bf44-ba07-434c-8cfb-dd3cdc08ec72-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"392","commentable":"true","byline":"Tshepo Mokoena","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/clip-joint-movies-genius-epiphanies-imitation-game-beautiful-mind","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/clip-joint-movies-genius-epiphanies-imitation-game-beautiful-mind","tags":[{"id":"film/series/clipjoint","webTitle":"Clip joint","description":"Each week a Guardian reader selects their five favourite clips to illustrate a chosen topic, then next week comes back into the blog to select their top choices from those suggested by other readers.

of the third instalment premiere, Donald Sutherland says young people have been ‘dormant’ for a generation or two</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>The actor Donald Sutherland has said that he had signed up for the Hunger Games franchise “for one specific reason: so that young people will recognise their obligation to change the government. To go to the voting booths in 2016 and choose somebody who will satisfy them. Because if they don’t we’re lost.”</p> <p>At a press conference before the film’s premiere in London, Sutherland, who plays the fascist dictator President Snow, said he hoped the films would help galvanise the young to bring “oligarchs” the world over to account, and to act as “a catalyst for young people who have been dormant for a generation or two, particularly in the US. That the Occupy movement fizzled out because it didn’t have a leader … I hope this film will in some way help generate a leader who will pull young people together in a way which they will understand.”</p> <p>The Hunger Games, adapted from Suzanne Collins’ bestselling series, had already staked out more politically conscious territory than Harry Potter and Twilight, the teenage franchises that preceded it. The original film, which was released in 2012, broke box office records and helped make a star of its lead actor, Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the resourceful Katniss, forced to compete in a lethal reality TV competition that is a central part of a future dystopian society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"021e7aeaae5f4b49ac6e4f1dd8ad27ab0a97b7de\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415647863534/b7c4e86a-a024-4425-a2e9-aa00943fc5bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Donald Sutherland as the fascist leader President Snow during The Hunger Games film franchise.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Sutherland as the fascist leader President Snow during The Hunger Games film franchise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A sequel, released last year, saw her return to the competition. The third book in the series, Mockingjay, was shot in two parts at a combined cost of $250m, with the first part reaching cinemas this month.</p> <p>This instalment sees Katniss coping with the bombing of her homeland, then being groomed in a bunker as the figurehead for a rebellion against President Snow. The film co-stars Julianne Moore and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as opposition politicians hoping to harness Katniss’s brand, as well as Stanley Tucci as the hideous Caesar, deep-tanned host of the Games’ TV broadcasts.</p> <p>Tucci, too, highlighted the lessons in the dangers of fascist regimes the film had for its audience. He compared his character’s compartmentalisation to that of the Holocaust organiser Adolf Eichmann, whom he has also played on film. “There are similarities to the behaviour. They’re at a remove. When Eichmann was asked by his captors about children he started crying saying, ‘I love children.’ ‘But what about all those children you sent to the death camps?’ ‘Yeah, but they were Jewish.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3966359758d26000ca39f8bfc2c29ecd79879710\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415647959139/1c63cacf-0c82-407c-9383-b7f7cb1c8fda-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Donald Sutherland and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman acting in The Hunger Games film franchise.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Sutherland and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman acting in The Hunger Games film franchise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The potential for such disconnect, Tucci added, was heightened in those raised on reality TV – a demographic which shares some overlap with core fans of The Hunger Games. “Reality TV is a misnomer and I can only imagine it confuses people,” he said, citing a study which suggested children who play computer games exhibit a diminished capacity for compassion. “It would only make sense that would translate through every bit of human behaviour. There’s no empathy.”</p> <p>Lawrence said being thrust into the spotlight at an early age had helped her relate to her character, who must learn to make extreme ideological rhetoric attractive to a mass audience. She read Collins’ books, she said, in her first film awards season in 2010, when she was nominated for the best actress Oscar for her role in Winter’s Bone.</p> <p>That, she said, meant “dresses that were uncomfortable and everyone all of a sudden listening to you. And you’re like: ‘Don’t listen to me, I’m 20.’ I felt there were parallels in having people look at you and listen to you when you don’t feel ready. And then forcing yourself. Thinking: ‘Well, if people are listening what should I say? I should have a point.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"260d70cb564b10af5f66537b01d635ea8a2811d2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415648090556/944d143c-b41c-4e79-bf9b-8d7813bae87b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cast members Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, director Francis Lawrence, producer Nina Jacobson, cast members Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and Sam Claflin, attend the photocall for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, part 1 in London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cast members Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, director Francis Lawrence, producer Nina Jacobson, cast members Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and Sam Claflin, attend the photocall for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Lawrence was also eager to distance herself from the levels of heroism exhibited by Katniss in the film. “I’m a very different person who handles emotions in a very different way. I’d have just been crying every single day and saying: ‘Where is my mum?’”</p> <p>Mockingjay Part 1 is released worldwide on 21 November, with the month before Christmas increasingly seen as a rival to the summer as a launchpad for blockbusters. Interstellar, Christopher Nolan’s space opera, took $132m globally on its first weekend of release at the start of November, a number Mockingjay will be likely to rival.</p> <p>The final part is scheduled for release next year, despite the death nine months ago of Hoffman , who had another week of shooting to complete. The director, Francis Lawrence, said no digital trickery would be employed to paper over any continuity gaps. The loss, he said, took a heavy toll. “Losing Phil was a horrible thing.

Nolan’s SF juggernaut was no match for a giant cuddly robot – probably because the Disney film made sense and wasn’t three hours long</p><p><em>Warning: contains spoilers</em></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>It’s as if future generations of ourselves, evolved to the point of trans-dimensionality, set up a series of obscure obstacles guiding us to make the correct movie-going choice this weekend. It may have been the soft reviews, it may have been the long running time, it may have been the complexity of format choices in which to view the picture, or it just may have been we got saddled with kids who wanted to see a movie with a big marshmallow, but however you slice it Disney/Marvel’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/interstellar-box-office-big-hero-6\"> Big Hero 6 soared to higher financial heights than Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar</a>.</p> <p>It’s not as if Interstellar’s fate includes schlepping down Hollywood Boulevard with a tin cup and a sob story – the movie made plenty of dough – but the trajectory for this one was supposed to be an unparalleled box office apogee. When the director of The Dark Knight trilogy and the dizzying dreamscape Inception promised his new one would be “hard SF” with a cast of heavy hitters it felt like one for the record books. In terms of dollars-and-cents, that is clearly not the case. Interstellar is Nolan’s lowest-grossing opener since 2005’s Batman Begins at under $50m. (The precise figures are still being tallied by Nasa scientists.) This is also the first time since 2002’s Insomnia that a Nolan picture has not opened in the number one slot. What kept Interstellar from achieving escape velocity? Why, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/big-hero-6-review\">a cuddly Michelin Man-looking nurse named Baymax</a>.</p> <p>Advertising and profile pieces still can’t top word-of-mouth, and good luck finding anyone coming out of Big Hero 6 who doesn’t have nice things to say about it. It’s got the right amount of adventure for kids and humour for adults. It also has Baymax, undoubtedly one of cinema’s most craftily designed creations. He’s clumsy like Chaplin, caring like ET and, for someone with great powers, amusingly clueless about human behaviour, all with a blank face and calm voice. Even though the plot of Big Hero 6 is ridiculous and relies on “science” as a cure-all storytelling crutch, there is a fleet-of-foot quality throughout. Its finale – a superhero team-up against an angry portal laying vacuum cleaner-like waste to the city – may be rote, but its logic holds up to scrutiny.</p> <p>One cannot say the same thing about the weekend’s other pro-science picture, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/05/interstellar-review-christopher-nolan-matthew-mcconaughey\">Interstellar</a>. Despite its 70mm splendour and breathtaking images of spaceships zooming past Saturn, woe be to anyone who tries to apply anything like logic to its conclusion. Yes, as with any speculative film, one must allow oneself to “just go with it”. Especially when dealing with story elements like time dilation, something we puny Earth creatures have yet to actually deal with in any substantial way in real life. But Nolan’s film presumes that audiences will be so dazzled by the film’s virtues – the look, the score, the actors’ performances – that they’ll sweep the storytelling problems under the rug. The fact remains that Interstellar’s ending would have been laughed out of the Star Trek: Voyager writers’ room. (And if you haven’t seen it yet, you’d better stop reading here.)</p> <p>In order to save the world, Matthew McConaughey and company zip off to another galaxy to look for a new planet while Michael Caine and the others work on “the gravity problem” to fire off a giant ark. While there are enough scenes of expository dialogue in Nolan’s film to fill a space station, this key question is deliberately shoved to the side. We get a quick glimpse at a blackboard marked up with an enormous equation, as if some mathematical Jackson Pollock went to town with a five-foot piece of chalk. In the blaze of spoken set-up Ann Hathaway tosses out a reference to general relativity versus quantum mechanics, a very real concern at the heart of cosmology. (The so-called Theory of Everything, similar to the Grand Unifying Theory, is the struggle to get these two seemingly paradoxical aspects of the physical world to harmonise.)</p> <p>Interstellar answers the Theory of Everything. Of course it doesn’t tell you, the viewer, the answer. If Christopher Nolan had actually figured it out we’d have heard about it on NPR. This bold leap isn’t the problem with the movie. It’s the way it is discovered and how this <em>deus ex measurement </em>is shoved into the storyline.</p> <p>In order to learn the secret, Matthew McConaughey must tumble into a black hole. You’d think he’d then be compressed into a singularity, but he’s saved by highly evolved multidimensional beings who exist beyond the boundaries of fourth-dimensional spacetime. He’s then plunked into a hall-of-mirrors-like tesseract, in which he can roam freely up and down the timeline. So far, so good. Frankly, most of my dreams that don’t involve unlimited trips to a mashed potato bar include such excursions.</p> <p>Interstellar posits that love is a binding universal force. It’s a nice idea, even if Luc Besson’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/\">The Fifth Element </a>got there first. But because of this, McConaughey is able to connect with his daughter from his otherworldly perch. After a minute or so of screaming and yelling, he figures out what he must do. He must tell his daughter how to fix “the gravity problem”. Because in the few minutes he’s been floating around in a reflective void, his pal TARS, a super computing robot in the form of a slab of chrome, has been able to read the telemetry from the black hole. Just by dropping in and taking a deep whiff he’s got the answer to life, the universe and everything.</p> <p>What to do with it? Well, since it is a maths equation, he’s able to take it, transpose it into Morse Code and then “download this” into the second hand of an analogue watch lying on Jessica Chastain’s shelf. An email might have been more effective, but that’s far less cinematic. This happens as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/22/hans-zimmer-five-best-movie-music-moments\">Hans Zimmer</a>’s propulsive music swells and Matthew McConaughey mutters “c’mon, c’mon, c’mon” even though he now has the power to float back and forth through time.</p> <p>In my non-scientific poll of friends and colleagues who saw Interstellar, most people questioned weren’t as annoyed by this story beat as I was. The reason most commonly given was “yeah, by that point I figured ‘sure, why not?’”. Shrugs all around, all except for the most ardent of Nolan fanboys. Foolishly, I’d been with the movie the whole time, which is why my ultimate take on the movie remained positive but tempered by disappointment.</p> <p>Big Hero 6, on the other hand, came to us without promises. And as such it’s hard not to come away pleasantly surprised. You are much more likely to recommend a movie that over-delivers than one that implodes under its own weight.</p>","headline":"How Interstellar lost out to Big Hero 6 at the US box office","trailText":"It turned out that Christopher Nolan’s SF juggernaut was no match for a giant cuddly robot.

contractor who blew the whistle on the US government’s mass surveillance programs, the film’s backers said on Monday. </p> <p>Stone, who won best director Oscars for Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/02/edward-snowden-nsa-film-oliver-stone\">written the screenplay based on two books</a> – The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man by Luke Harding and Time of the Octopus by Anatoly Kucherena. </p> <p>The still untitled film goes into production in Munich in January, said independent studio Open Road Films and production and financing company Endgame Entertainment. </p> <p>Producer Moritz Borman said in a statement that he and Stone chose Open Road and Endgame because “this film needs an independent in the true sense, where political pressures will not come into play.” </p> <p>Snowden leaked tens of thousands of classified intelligence documents to the media in 2013 and sparked a firestorm over the NSA’s gathering of data from the Internet activities and phones of millions of ordinary Americans and dozens of world leaders. </p> <p>The recently released <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/11/citizenfour-review-snowden-vindicated-poitras-nsa-journalism\">documentary Citizenfour by Laura Poitras</a> chronicles how the former NSA contractor decided to leak the documents and the global repercussions of that act. </p> <p>Snowden spent almost six weeks at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport before Russia granted him asylum for a year on 1 August, 2013, creating a furore in the United States. In August this year he was given a three-year resident permit by Russia and now lives at an undisclosed address in Moscow. </p> <p>He is wanted by the United States on charges including theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and wilful communication of classified intelligence to an unauthorized person. </p> <p>Gordon-Levitt, 33, most recently directed and starred in Don Jon and has acted in high-profile films “Lincoln,” “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Inception.” </p>","headline":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt confirmed as Edward Snowden in Oliver Stone NSA film","trailText":"Film’s backers confirm that actor will play whistleblower in the forthcoming film, which goes into production in Munich in January","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415652810779/adbca373-6c69-443d-a013-234f22d146b2-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"312","commentable":"true","byline":"Reuters in Los Angeles","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-13T16:00:00-05:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/joseph-gordon-levitt-edward-snowden-oliver-stone-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/10/joseph-gordon-levitt-edward-snowden-oliver-stone-film","tags":[{"id":"film/joseph-gordon-levitt","webTitle":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/joseph-gordon-levitt","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/joseph-gordon-levitt","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden","description":"Latest on the computer analyst whistleblower who provided the Guardian with top-secret NSA documents leading to revelations about US surveillance on phone and internet communications","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/edward-snowden","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA","description":"The latest news and comment on the US National Security Agency","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nsa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/nsa","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/oliver-stone","webTitle":"Oliver Stone","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oliver-stone","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/oliver-stone","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-3a974528-05f0-4963-bf13-c67a2561c808","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/22/1411373613551/4ed6b1c2-d5f5-4e35-972e-166b5d39c804-620x372.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/22/1411373613551/4ed6b1c2-d5f5-4e35-972e-166b5d39c804-620x372.jpeg","source":"AP, Guardian","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Taking on the NSA as Snowden ...

It’s full of stars ...”</p> <p>Cinephiles of a certain age will know that the quote paraphrased above refers not to the presence of a plethora of Hollywood’s finest, but to the innumerable suns of the universe on whose mystery Stanley Kubrick mused in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar does boast performances from big names, but – in our image-saturated age, with the movie-making process so transparent – can the film awe us in the same way Kubrick did? When every day we walk beneath the biggest mystery of all with bowed heads, our gazes fixed on our phones, can Interstellar, like 2001, inspire us to look skyward, and to wonder?</p> <h2>Story</h2> <p>Most contemporary western cinema plays us like violins. Indeed, we are so accustomed to having our heartstrings manipulated, Kubrick’s philosophic concerns can appear cold and clinical in comparison.</p> <p>Like so many of the classic films of its era, the very qualities that made 2001 a timeless, visionary work mean that in the current cinematic climate it would never get past development stage. The slow pace of the narrative, and the austere, Bressonian withholding of emotion that brings the transcendent scenes later in the film into sharp relief, are enough to get studio executives reaching for the red buzzer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/aug/01/interstellar-matthew-mcconaughey-trailer-christopher-nolan-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2135668\"                data-video-name=\"Interstellar: watch Matthew McConaughey in the trailer for Christopher Nolan's new space adventure – video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Bros\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/1/1406881887402/Matthew-McConaughey-in-In-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-443523579\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/1/1406881886058/Matthew-McConaughey-in-In-009.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/01/140801Interstellar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/01/140801Interstellar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/01/140801Interstellar.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/01/140801Interstellar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/01/140801Interstellar/140801Interstellar.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Interstellar</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interstellar, however, ticks all the right blockbuster boxes. The edge-of-your-seat scene in which Coop attempts to dock his spacecraft at speed with a wildly spinning space station (Crew member: “That’s not possible!” Coop: “No – it’s necessary!”) is one of many virtuoso action sequences.</p> <p>Where Kubrick had his computer system, HAL, undergoing something of an existential crisis of it’s own, Interstellar’s robot features a variable sense of humour setting; up high it teases the crew with a self-destruct countdown, set lower it regales them with knock knock jokes.</p> <p>In contrast to 2001’s “man alone” narrative, under the sci-fi trappings Interstellar is at heart a family story, a tale of a father trying to do the right thing by his children. The moment late in the film when a regretful Coop watches his past self leave his weeping daughter to embark on the mission to save the world, and the desperate message he manages to send through time and space to himself – “Stay” – is utterly heartbreaking.</p> <h2>Direction</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681a97c3568b176c1dfa76adb13e452716b9b81e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415633234821/50bd2c33-4b23-42e1-8379-22753871cea0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iconoclastic … Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MGM/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even 13 years after the titular date, Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 remains a monolithic presence in film history. Imposing, inscrutable, iconoclastic – the film casts a long shadow over the sci-fi genre.</p> <p>Christopher Nolan has himself spoken of his admiration for Kubrick’s “trust of the one powerful image”, as opposed to the multitudinous shots and frenetic cutting that characterises most contemporary western cinema. The oft-mentioned cinematic poetry of the falling bone to orbiting space station cut is among the most striking examples of Kubrick’s genius for clarity.</p> <p>Despite being a Kubrick fan, Nolan lays it on thick from the opening sequence, with a thunderous flashback to Coop crashing a spacecraft. During 2001’s pre-credit “sequence” on the other hand, the audience is kept in complete darkness for over two minutes while the eerie, ominous notes of Ligeti’s Atmospheres whorl and undulate on the soundtrack.</p> <p>The two films align more closely in their third acts, with the protagonists’ reaching the end of their respective journeys. In 2001, Bowman reaches the third monolith near Jupiter and appears to be thrown through a cosmic portal to another galaxy, to be reborn as some kind of star child. In Interstellar, Coop is drawn into a black hole, inside which Nolan envisages an Escher-like architectural structure representing a single moment in time – the scene in which Coop leaves his daughter. The sequence is undoubtedly ingenious, but still bound by logic, a puzzle to be solved. By this stage in 2001, any such intellectualising has long since been jettisoned out of the film’s metaphorical airlock like an irksome alien, in favour of a surreality meant to coax the audience into imagining the unimaginable for themselves.</p> <h2>Message</h2> <p>The “golden age” of the 1970s gave us Solaris and Silent Running, and even Close Encounters of the Third Kind shared something of 2001’s philosophical and spiritual ambition. Of the more recent attempts however, such as Danny Boyle’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/06/actionandadventure.sciencefictionandfantasy\">Sunshine </a>and Ridley Scott’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/30/prometheus-review\">Prometheus</a>, only the low-budget indie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/08/another-earth-film-review\">Another Earth </a>has truly touched on the existential enigmas of Kubrick’s masterpiece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bfc68c395d0baf79971ee307e8f0f7017e0191b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415635777822/13b6465c-6c3f-4089-a940-8a9c8685bf64-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solitary experience … Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What sets 2001 apart above all is the director’s assumption of natural intelligence and engagement on the part of the audience. Instead of resolution or answers, Kubrick gives us images to consider and interpret. In over two and a half hours of running time, the film has only 40 minutes of dialogue. By creating an essentially purely visual piece of cinema, Kubrick allows the film’s meaning to be entirely subjective. The director himself spoke of 2001 demanding “emotional comprehension” from the audience, as opposed to an intellectual understanding, that he hoped would stimulate the “mythological and religious yearnings and impulses” in the viewers own subconscious mind. In terms of an overall message, the most one can say is that the film ends in spiritual grace, in hope.</p> <p>Interstellar’s abiding message is also one of hope, but Nolan gives us the fierce faith of familial survival rather than the fulfilment of an existential destiny, celebrates human love rather than spiritual transcendence. Thrilling and sincere, Interstellar remains a comic book to Kubrick’s lyric poem. Yet, for all it’s beauty, it’s myth and music, 2001 is a solitary experience, while Interstellar is a tribute to what holds us together.</p>","headline":"Interstellar v 2001: A Space Odyssey: worlds apart or on the same planet?","trailText":"<strong>Rowan Righelato: </strong>Does Christopher Nolan’s new sci-fi blockbuster reach the dizzy, awe-inspiring heights of Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 masterpiece?","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/10/1415632675099/Interstellar-006.jpg","wordcount":"945","commentable":"true","byline":"Rowan Righelato","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-17T15:10:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/10/interstellar-2001-a-space-odyssey-christoper-nolan-kubrick","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/10/interstellar-2001-a-space-odyssey-christoper-nolan-kubrick","tags":[{"id":"film/sciencefictionandfantasy","webTitle":"Science fiction and fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","references":[]},{"id":"film/interstellar","webTitle":"Interstellar","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/interstellar","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/interstellar","references":[]},{"id":"film/2001-a-space-odyssey","webTitle":"2001: A Space Odyssey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey","references":[]},{"id":"film/christopher-nolan","webTitle":"Christopher Nolan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/christopher-nolan","references":[]},{"id":"film/stanleykubrick","webTitle":"Stanley Kubrick","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stanleykubrick","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/stanleykubrick","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rowan-righelato","webTitle":"Rowan Righelato","r2ContributorId":"58772","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/19/1379609957281/Rowan-Righelato-003.jpg","firstName":"rowan","lastName":"righelato","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rowan Righelato writes occasionally, mostly about cinema and is a Guardian picture researcher <br />You can read Rowan's personal blog<a href=\"http://rowanrighelato.wordpress.com\"> here</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowan-righelato","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowan-righelato","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"6b89f2038221c85431899bb519382fa14a148282","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/10/1415632681383/Interstellar-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"¬©2013 Warner Bros.

But the Hollywood machine was already in full gear on Saturday night at its Governors awards ceremony in the ballroom of the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. </p> <p>Oscar hopefuls, including Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal, schmoozed with studio executives in a black-tie kickoff to awards season. “It’s an opportunity to see and be seen,” said film editor Mark Helfrich, one of the more than 5,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who vote on the Oscars. “Almost anyone who’s on the (nominee) list is here.” </p> <p>Officially this was the Academy’s Board of Governors’ night to give its awards for lifetime achievement in film and philanthropy. This year they honoured <a href=\"http://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/Maureen-OHara-cut-off-during-her-Oscar-acceptance-speech.html\">Maureen O’Hara</a>, 94, the Irish-born actor who often starred opposite John Wayne; Japanese animator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki\">Hayao Miyazaki</a>; screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/28/jean-claude-carriere-fame-screenwriter\">Jean-Claude Carrière</a>, who worked with Luis Buñuel and singer and civil rights activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2012/jul/03/harry-belafonte-video-interview\">Harry Belafonte</a>. The 87-year-old was travelling to Ferguson, Missouri, the next day, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">9 August shooting of a black man </a>by a white police officer sparked weeks of unrest. .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92701cfaffc1d63c7d97fe03328eabc75a8c3322\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415637944091/b39ae9f1-d412-471a-ab84-3f82c560f549-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Benedict Cumberbatch Keira Knightley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keira Knightley with Benedict Cumberbatch at the Governors Awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/REX/Everett Collection/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the ceremony, footage of which is edited into the Oscar’s night broadcast, is also a lavish backdrop for a night of Hollywood power-brokering and networking. Cumberbatch would appear to have a good shot at getting a golden statue for his role as world war two code-breaker Alan Turing in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/08/the-imitation-game-review-script-fails-to-sizzle\">The Imitation Game,</a> as he spent much of the evening flanked by mega-producer Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>Weinstein’s company backed The King’s Speech, which won an Oscar for its star Colin Firth. He reportedly paid a record $7m for the US rights to The Imitation Game, whose screenplay was written by Chicago-born Graham Moore. </p> <p>“We haven’t sold any tickets yet,” said Moore, a self-proclaimed tech-nerd who has been obsessed with Turing for years. Cumberbatch, who was flanked by his co-star Keira Knightley, was starstruck by fellow thespians Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.“I just felt out of my body when I met Michael (Keaton) and Ed (Norton),” Cumberbatch told the Guardian, slicing into his filet mignon steak. “It was so great to talk with them about the craft [of acting].”</p> <p>Since its inception six years ago, the event has ingrained itself into the Hollywood calendar. Between the awards, which saw Liam Neeson introducing O’Hara along with Clint Eastwood, many guests left dinner untouched as they mingled and chatted. Actor Ethan Hawke, who plays the father in Boyhood, whose cast and crew were there in force, was more cynical. “This is business, baby. Business.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a62c4c670736d8075706ec797e5b0975649037d3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415638033623/7692fe90-2f34-48b8-879c-723b77551303-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette and Richard Linklater\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and Boyhood director Richard Linklater at the Governors Awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Judging by the buzz on the night, other strong Oscar contenders include JK Simmons, who plays a fearsome musical professor in a Julliard-esque school in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/17/sundance-film-festival-review-whiplash\">Whiplash</a>, and Robert Downey Jr, who was seated next to Robert Duvall, his co-star in The Judge.

and director’s decision to work together on new Bourne project throws Jeremy Renner’s offshoot into doubt</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Since the final instalment of the original Bourne trilogy, 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum, the rumour mill has never really tired of chattering about another Bourne story starring Matt Damon as the titular spy. This time last year, Paul Greengrass, director of the latter two instalments of the trilogy, dismissed rumours he was making another Bourne film with Damon as a “figment of someone’s imagination”. Stating that they hadn’t even discussed a fourth film, Greengrass said, “You’ve got to move on and do different things,” and last December reiterated, “I discovered in my heart I didn’t have another one in me.”</p> <p>Matt Damon has always maintained he wouldn’t be involved in any continuation of the franchise without Greengrass, and with a spin-off franchise starring Jeremy Renner picking up the Bourne brand name and taking it in its own direction, that seemed to be an end of it.</p> <p>That is until Friday, when Ben Affleck let slip that Damon and Greengrass would team up to give the amnesiac punch factory another outing. Affleck <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/596274/matt-damon-confirms-he-s-reprising-his-role-as-jason-bourne\">told E! News</a>, “He’s going to be doing a Bourne movie next fall”, before Damon confirmed the story. “Paul Greengrass is going to do another one and that’s all I ever said. I just needed him to say yes,” he said.</p> <p>Quite what this means for the Renner-starring offshoot of the series remains to be seen. A sequel to 2012’s The Bourne Legacy was scheduled for 2016 with Fast and Furious director Justin Lin attached, and a Bourne film of some kind is still lined up for release on 15 July of that year, though whether it’s the Lin-directed, Renner-starring variety or the Matt Damon/Greengrass iteration is unclear.</p> <p>If both strands are to continue, the idea could be to eventually combine them, presumably with Greengrass at the helm if Damon is involved. Jeremy Renner seems all for this approach: “Them coming together would be a pretty tremendous thing,” <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/jeremy-renner-matt-damon_n_5870072.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000024\">he told The Huffington Post last month</a>. “I think that is ultimately the plan.”</p>","headline":"Bourne again: Ben Affleck confirms Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass will team up  for fourth time","trailText":"Star and director’s decision to work together on new Bourne project throws Jeremy Renner’s offshoot into doubt, writes Luke Holland","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632659522/THE-BOURNE-SUPREMACY-FILM-001.jpg","wordcount":"333","commentable":"true","byline":"Luke Holland","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-17T15:07:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/matt-damon-paul-greengrass-fourth-bourne-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/10/matt-damon-paul-greengrass-fourth-bourne-film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/mattdamon","webTitle":"Matt Damon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mattdamon","references":[]},{"id":"film/paulgreengrass","webTitle":"Paul Greengrass","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paulgreengrass","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/paulgreengrass","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/luke-holland","webTitle":"Luke Holland","r2ContributorId":"54129","firstName":"luke","lastName":"holland","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Luke Holland is a freelance writer for the Guardian.

Liar: my most overrated

Bradshaw kicks off our new series on the films our writers think are overrated by bursting Billy Liar’s bubble, which starred Tom Courtenay as a dreamer who creates a fantasy world to escape his boring life</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Everyone loves <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119978/billy-liar\">Billy Liar</a>, that classic 60s British picture directed by John Schlesinger, starring Tom Courtenay as Billy himself – the bright, cheeky lad, daft as a brush, lost in his own Walter Mitty fantasies.</p> <p>Except me. I don’t love it. It’s a nice performance from Courtenay, but I’ve always felt that this insidiously depressing and defeatist film was massively overrated. Looking back on the re-release in 2007, I see I gave it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/comedy1\">a tepid three-star notice</a>, and looked askance on Billy’s “loyalty to unhappiness and failure”. Watching it again now, my discontent has escalated to a kind of rage. <strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: this basically boils down to the ending, which is broadly the same in content and in spirit to the 1959 Keith Waterhouse novel on which it is based.</p> <p>Throughout the movie, Billy is frustrated (as unmarried, respectably brought-up young chaps of that period tended to be) and he is moreover mightily fed up with his job in a shop selling “funeral furnishings”; he dreams of escaping to London to become a comedy writer. But in a way he is already the author of comic fantasies – inside his own head. He is forever zooming off into a bizarre and hilarious world of his own. He imagines himself to be the ruler of a made-up world called Ambrosia, commanding a preposterous army.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d48d665a9b04f755bfdac9e3b57d8fb298b08ba6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415612116818/47165f8a-3962-4f6d-882e-d2a2de5144fd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Way out ...

Tom Courtenay and Julie Christie in Billy Liar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But all of Billy’s fantasies are crushed like eggshells when we get right down to it. A beautiful young woman and free-spirit called Liz, played by Julie Christie, encourages him to come with her down to London to make his dreams a reality: they get on the train together, but at the last moment, Billy bottles it. On the pretext of going to get some milk from a platform vending machine, he scuttles off, then pretends to be vexed at missing the train, but is secretly relieved and marches back to his sad little house, the Ambrosian army tramping along visibly behind him.</p> <p>Now, there is nothing more tiresome than people objecting to “miserabilism” and I accept that Billy’s fantasies are at least partly an indication of his dysfunction, his anxiety, his very reluctance to go out and face the world. And, of course, there were – and are – plenty of guys like Billy who are trapped. But throughout the film, until we reach that dreary ending, the fantasies had been sold to us as liberating, hilarious episodes — aspirational episodes. They show how Billy could imagine something other than the life he was living. They show he was defiant in spirit, and part of new working-class generation that wasn’t going to be kept in its place. Those fantasies were Billy’s rocket fuel — weren’t they? They were showing he was going places.</p> <p>And after all, Keith Waterhouse was going places. Billy Liar had a strong streak of autobiography. Waterhouse was a bright, imaginative lad from Leeds who worked in an undertaker’s after flunking the 11-plus. His imagination, like a boxer’s fists, was his way out. And he got out. He became a celebrated author, columnist and playwright. Now, maybe Waterhouse had a few Billy-ish moments of panic and scrambling off trains at the last moment, but he made it in the end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b9105bae5a5d6b4a66f4392f94b0a5e9c248432\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415612192154/01939c2b-2bfb-4e41-ac62-124b3409205f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bye Billy ...

Julie Christie in Billy Liar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Everett Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not Billy. His failure, meekly accepted, seems to be presented to us as the only plausible and aesthetically satisfying ending. He, and we, pay for our laughs with this slump into disappointment. That final glimpse of the Ambrosian army is clearly supposed to be a little cheery note of fun. Actually, it’s awful. When Billy is marching home, and that army appears behind him, and Billy suddenly gets a silly little smirk on his face — I want to scream and reach into the screen and shake him. If this catastrophe was represented to us as a deliberate moment of tragedy, like the ending of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, then I could live with it. But it just looks like a failure of nerve, even a kind of dishonesty. I can live without Billy Liar.<br /> </p>","headline":"Billy Liar: my most overrated film","trailText":"<strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong> kicks off our new series on the films our writers think are overrated by bursting Billy Liar’s bubble, which starred Tom Courtenay as a dreamer who creates a fantasy world to escape his boring life","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415612005124/b92dc109-395d-44d8-a08f-427cdbe70db2-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"697","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-13T11:15:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/billy-liar-my-most-over-rated-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/10/billy-liar-my-most-over-rated-film","tags":[{"id":"film/most-overrated-films","webTitle":"Most overrated films","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/most-overrated-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/most-overrated-films","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterbradshaw","webTitle":"Peter Bradshaw","rcsId":"GNL378000","r2ContributorId":"16262","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749338256/PeterBradshaw.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png","firstName":"","lastName":"bradshaw","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian's film critic.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbradshaw","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/peterbradshaw","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"43d18883f0fefa020b16ea9f7f14900266574431","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415612004534/b92dc109-395d-44d8-a08f-427cdbe70db2-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415612004534/b92dc109-395d-44d8-a08f-427cdbe70db2-220x132.jpeg","source":"Public Domain","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Off in the clouds ...

Nicholas Barber can’t bear to watch</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hllfotbbQ3U\">The new trailer for the imminent Paddington Bear film</a> may have upset the purists among us – it’s all a bit too Harry Potter for my liking – but in general it’s fairly faithful to Michael Bond’s original bear-out-of-water stories. There’s the battered suitcase and the floppy hat. There’s the Brown family and their grumpy neighbour. There’s Paddington’s knack for making a mess and causing a kerfuffle. There’s the ice queen who’s scheming to kill him and display his taxidermicised hide in the Natural History Museum. And there’s the … waaaaiiiit a minute. I may not have read every one of Bond’s books, but I’m pretty sure that the trailer’s peroxide Cruella de Vil impersonator, as played by Nicole Kidman, has strutted in from a different franchise altogether.</p> <p>We shouldn’t be too surprised. Just as films based on British sitcoms always pack their characters off on a sunshine holiday, no one seems capable of putting an innocent children’s programme on the big screen without turning it into a borderline horror movie. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_4gCFYrRxw\">Postman Pat: The Movie</a> took a fluffy television series about rural village niceness and added in the one element that it had always lacked: a megalomaniac who planned to conquer the world with his army of cybermen. And in 2005, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EdXmKt2ujo\">The Magic Roundabout film had Dougal and his chums racing to stop an evil wizard</a> bringing about a new ice age with the aid of his skeleton henchmen. It was almost inevitable, then, that Paddington would be landed with a bloodthirsty nemesis, too. But it’s still as depressing as a mouldy marmalade sandwich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hllfotbbQ3U\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hllfotbbQ3U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>I admit, I have a personal stake in this: my six-year-old daughter is probably the planet’s most squeamish film-watcher. She refuses point blank to sit through scenes of extreme danger or cruelty, so our viewing options are severely limited. Snow White is out. Sleeping Beauty is out. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1k0IIpJOLM\">Finding Nemo was a never-to-be-repeated disaster.</a> The Jungle Book is tolerable as long as we fast-forward past the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuFZNqI8mc8\">Shere Khan bits</a>. And Frozen is a favourite because it doesn’t include a typically gothic Disney villain – one reason, I suspect, why it’s now the highest-grossing cartoon ever released. But beyond those … well, think of the last film you saw that was aimed at small children, and the chances are that the characters were almost stabbed, poisoned, melted, or eaten by dinosaurs.</p> <p>It’s a rule of thumb that goes back to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bambi%27s+mother+shot&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=nOZcVLDDH-Po7Aaa4oDoBg\">Bambi’s mother being shot by hunters</a>. Actually, it goes right back to the days when no fairytale was complete without someone being blinded or shut in an oven. We’ve always been keen, it seems, on children’s stories that traumatise their target audience. But maybe it’s time for a change. I’ve heard the fashionable academic argument that these macabre narratives prepare youngsters for the fear and grief that await them in later life. But I’m not convinced that the makers of the Postman Pat movie ever had such noble goals in mind when they threw in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/06/postman-pat-the-movie-3d-trailer-review\">homicidal robo-cat with laser-beam eyes</a>. I’m not convinced, either, that the most valuable lesson that our offspring can learn is: “The people you love will die.” They’ll learn it soon enough, anyway, and, when that day comes, it’s not going to be any less painful because they’ve seen Finding Nemo. Wouldn’t it be more helpful to teach them some slightly cheerier lessons? How about, “You can be adventurous without putting yourself in mortal danger” or, “Life can be thrilling even if you’re not being menaced by a criminal mastermind”? In the meantime, shoving some death and destruction into a kids’ film is simply the laziest, least imaginative way of padding it out. And Paddington does not need padding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"559378f97f3db398e613e5893b8d01ccf5e6c6c9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415385286151/19ac9b53-224a-47e2-8e1d-c99322202080-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’m not saying that nerve-shredding terror doesn’t have its place in toddlers’ entertainment – perish the thought – and I accept that not every child is as pathetically wimpy as mine. But I’m sure that there must be some other wusses of her age out there. Don’t they deserve to see Paddington without the whole thing turning darker than darkest Peru?</p> <p>Perhaps we could introduce a quota – say, one children’s film which doesn’t feature a murderous psychopath for every two which do. After all, there are countless grown-up comedies which don’t put their characters in life-threatening peril, so it seems perverse that there are so few of them for pre-teens. Besides, children’s television manages to enthrall and delight its viewers without making them blub their eyes out. Trust me, I watch it for hours and hours and hours every week. But as much as I treasure the time spent with my daughter in front of Old Jack’s Boat and Abney &amp; Teal, I still wish we could watch the odd film together, too.</p> <p>• <a

documentary Life Itself provides an unflinching portrait of the legendary critic and movie buff</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>As a film-crazy teenager who spent unholy amounts of time in darkened rooms watching movies in the arthouses and multiplexes of early 80s Washington DC, I grew up on Sneak Previews, the movie-review show hosted by rival Chicago film critics Gene Siskel and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/roger-ebert\">Roger Ebert</a>. Each Sunday the show covered the next Friday’s movie releases, offering two hefty clips from each movie, followed by spirited, sometimes contentious and ill-tempered debate upon its merits, and a final verdict: thumbs up or thumbs down.</p> <p>I was too promiscuous a moviegoer to let critics keep me away from any film but I noticed that my tastes lined up more often with Ebert’s than Siskel’s. Their combat was great TV and, as fellow Chicagoan Steve James’s documentary portrait <strong>Life Itself</strong> shows, their often prickly relationship evolved in the years before Siskel’s death in 1999 into grudging fraternal love. (Siskel, a lean fellow, once cracked that producers asked the overweight Ebert never to wear brown on screen “because he looked like a mudslide”. But it was Ebert who shared that story, chuckling.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9ud1HUHgug\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9ud1HUHgug?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>When Ebert died last year the outpouring of grief and admiration was tsunami-like. His approachability and common touch were legendary; he loved high art and low trash, from Fassbinder, on whom he taught college courses, to Russ Meyer, for whom he wrote two sleaze epics featuring Meyer’s trademark top-heavy temptresses. His writing was a marvel of concision, clarity and populist readability, and arose directly from who he was and where he was from: a lower-middle class, midcentury, midwestern Catholic (lapsed) from a strongly pro-union family, deeply imprinted with a Chicagoan good sense and practicality. He had that miraculous ability to see 500 movies a year, and review half of them, decade after decade. He reminded me of the similarly plump food writer James Beard at a mustard-tasting, his palate still fresh and alive for mustard No 50, while the other teary-eyed judges were gagging and gargling water.</p> <p>Steve James had no idea that his movie would document Ebert’s last five months alive, but the results demonstrate that Ebert died as well as he lived, facing down 11 years of cancer that took his voice, half his face and finally his life. We see Roger having his throat wounds drained (Ebert’s idea), we meet his amazing wife Chazz, an African American attorney he met at AA, and learn how many critics he influenced, but there’s also plenty of criticism. Siskel’s widow reminds us (kindly) that he could be “full of himself” and Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum dissents on the quality of his critical stances, still without speaking ill of the dead. It’s an unflinching portrait, warts, waistline and all, but its subject is never anything less than the real hero of his own life – and not many of us can say that.</p>","headline":"The real Roger

Bullhead to Rust And Bone, the outspoken actor is making a name playing tough guys with a twist</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Oh <em>merde</em>!” It’s 4pm in Antibes and Matthias Schoenaerts has just woken up. Doing night shoots on Maryland, a film about an ex-soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder, he’s staying in an apartment and has just discovered it’s too late to order food from the local restaurant. “Oh my God, I’m hungry, and I get really cranky when I don’t eat,” he continues. “If all of a sudden you hear a police car, you know something’s happened. I’m kidding. I’ll find myself some food. The animal needs to eat.”</p> <p>Belgium’s Schoenaerts knows something about animalism. For 2011’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/bullhead-review\">Bullhead</a>, a disturbing drama about a cattle farmer hooked on steroids, he spent 18 months pumping up in the gym to play a traumatised character more akin to a bison than a man. In 2012’s Rust And Bone he was just as feral, playing an impulsive, promiscuous kickboxer. In this month’s The Drop, he’s a hugely intimidating Brooklyn bum who reeks of trouble. Animal is the word.</p> <p>Directed by Bullhead’s Michaël R Roskam and written by Dennis Lehane, The Drop is an inner-city noir about a quiet barkeep (Tom Hardy) entwined in a world of hitmen; James Gandolfini stars in his final role as the bar owner up to his neck in it, and Schoenaerts is Eric, a thuggish vagrant who beats dogs and women alike (chiefly his ex-girlfriend, played by Noomi Rapace). “I just wanted to make him as human and as full-dimensional as possible,” says Schoenaerts. “I didn’t want to play him as this typical neighbourhood freak.” Indeed, Eric is a jittery, hopeless but severely threatening presence, because Schoenaerts plays him as somebody with nothing to lose. His desperation makes him scary. “It’s an emotional desperation. I didn’t want to portray him as a macho type of guy. Basically he’s a pathetic mythomaniac who tries to live up to his lies, and is emotionally devastated by this situation with his girlfriend. He tries to hustle his way back to how his life was before and does it in such a desperate way that it is, hopefully, disturbing to watch.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7ee2a13b296a48c420220c54dbc92fabe8c8307\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415359223224/22898fe5-9958-43d7-90c8-d253f78c6639-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"James Gandolfini and Matthias Schoenaerts in The Drop\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Gandolfini and Matthias Schoenaerts in The Drop</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is. Schoenaerts excels as these broken, fragile messes who think with their fists and he has always had a fascination for such characters. Mike Tyson was a childhood hero. “As a kid I remember seeing that man for the first time on the television and for some reason he really did something to me,” he says. “He emotionally disturbed me. He’s a fascinating, ambiguous person that has been, in my opinion, falsely demonised.” I ask what he means by falsely, and his explanation is an insight into the dimensions Schoenaerts gives his characters, and how he gets us to empathise with them. “He’s been over-accused by people who were feeding that demon because it was making them money, and he ended up in the corner,” he says. “I could go on for hours. I find it disturbing to see how it’s exploited. Yeah, he probably has a temper, but you can’t blame it all on him.”</p> <p>There’s a line to be drawn from his childhood fascination with Tyson to these self-destructive, wounded animals Schoenaerts plays. “It also has to do with a new portrayal of masculinity,” he says. “American cinema used to present males as ridiculous hero types, and then actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean came in. And all of a sudden you get a new portrayal of masculinity, and I think that keeps on going on. That kind of wounded animal archetype definitely fits into that.”</p> <p>Schoenaerts himself was born and raised in Antwerp, where he still lives. His dad was a stage actor, and Schoenaerts was put off by the scene: “I thought all the people he was surrounded by were a bunch of self-absorbed dickheads,” he says. “I never wanted to go there.” He later changed his mind for a reason he will only describe as “very, very personal”, but when he got into it, he attacked it with gusto. The year and a half he spent bulking up for Bullhead, living on endless tuna, chicken and pasta, pushing his body to dysmorphic degrees, gained him 65lbs of brawn. To play Rust And Bone’s out-of-shape brute, he threw himself into the gym while at the same time stuffing his face with two tubs of Häagen-Dazs a day.</p> <p>Yet for all of his prep, he likes to remain as instinctive as possible, working things out on set, not discussing too much with directors in advance. “That’s really boring,” he says. “I think it should be a creative process of surprising and pushing each other, instead of getting caught up in intellectual masturbation.” On screen he’s always unsettlingly unpredictable, even in underwhelming fare such as crime drama Blood Ties, when Schoenaerts shows up it’s like an actual lunatic has invaded a film set. For him, he says, it’s just fun.</p> <p>“Sorry for being outspoken, sometimes there’s a little profanity,” he says, as we wrap up. “It’s just part of where I am right now, because I’m working on a dark film. Don’t think I’m just a vulgar kid.” He laughs. But I hope he finds some breakfast.</p> <p><strong><em>The Drop is in cinemas from Friday</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

blockbuster</a></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>The title of Christopher Nolan’s behemoth space epic says it all – a grandiloquent declaration of scale that smacks simultaneously of ambition and hubris – like Titanic, both the ship <em>and</em> the film. The good news is that this flawed but frequently awe-inspiring movie about wormholes and black holes does not implode into a dark star of disappointment; if it’s spectacle you want, then <em>Interstellar </em>delivers, particularly when viewed in Nolan’s preferred 70mm Imax format.</p> <p>Yet while the film’s massive gravitational pull guarantees astronomical box-office returns, fans of Nolan’s finest works (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/memento\"><em>Memento</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/12/drama.sciencefictionandfantasy\"><em>The Prestige</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jun/19/features.review17\"><em>Batman Begins</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/18/inception-film-review-philip-french\"><em>Inception</em></a>) will long for more narrative rigour as raw science, rich sentimentality and rank silliness battle for the heart and soul of this very personal project. As a diehard Nolanoid, I found myself largely enthralled, often amazed and occasionally aghast.</p> <p>Seamlessly amalgamating his own semi-formed stories about space travel with a script that his brother Jonathan (“Jonah”) had been developing for Steven Spielberg, Nolan’s long-gestating magnum opus is a futuristic fable firmly rooted in the age-old traditions of sci-fi. We open in a dust-bowl dystopian future where blighted food supplies are dwindling and inhabitable Earth is dying. Harking back to Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie’s 1933 novel <em>When Worlds Collide</em> (a Depression-era text brought to the screen by producer George Pal in the 1950s), Nasa builds a “space ark” – a giant ship that will take mankind to a new home in the stars, provided the “problem of gravity” can be solved by avuncular Professor Brand (Michael Caine).</p> <p>Meanwhile, <em>Right Stuff</em>-style pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/matthew-mcconaughey\">Matthew McConaughey</a>) is prompted by ghostly forces to lead an exploratory mission through a wormhole beyond the rings of Saturn, abandoning his family in search of a future for all humanity. What follows is a dizzying mash-up of <em>The Haunting</em>, <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/27/silent-running-french-classic-dvd\"><em>Silent Running</em></a>, <em>Event Horizon </em>and the director’s cut of <em>Aliens</em>, with the inverted time shifts of <em>Inception </em>(an hour on a distant planet equals lost years back on Earth) thrown in for extra emotional heft.</p> <p>While it’s temptingly easy to cite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey\"><em>2001</em></a> (anything invoking a dimensional “star gate” triggers rarely positive Kubrick comparisons), the movie that hangs over <em>Interstellar </em>like the dust cloud atmospherically engulfing its earthbound scenes is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/68855/contact\"><em>Contact</em></a>, with which it shares much more than just leading man McConaughey. Adapted from a novel by Carl Sagan (with signature input from <em>Interstellar</em>’s<em> </em>theoretical physicist Kip Thorne), Robert Zemeckis’s 1997 epic similarly centred on a daughter crying out to a lost father whose soul seems to abide somewhere across the universe.</p> <p>In both movies, it is these daughters who detect the first stirrings of an “alien” encounter: Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) identifying recurrent sequences in the white noise of interstellar radiation in <em>Contact</em>; Murph (very affectingly played in her younger years by Mackenzie Foy) spying morse code in poltergeist disturbances in <em>Interstellar</em>. From such discoveries are missions launched, voyaging across time and space at the apparent instruction of a superior intelligence offering cryptic hands across the universe.</p> <p>Intergalactic portals are breached, timescales bifurcated, science and faith reconciled. Crucially, for all their astro-maths exposition, the constant in both stories is neither time, space, nor gravity, but love. More than once I was reminded of <em>Contact</em>’s Ellie striking the outer limits of the universe and breathlessly declaring: “They should have sent a poet.” In dispatching Nolan beyond the stars, that’s exactly what they’ve done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/dec/15/interstellar-trailer-christopher-nolan-matthew-mcconaughey-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2013668\"                data-video-name=\"Interstellar: trailer for Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Brothers\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/15/1387110386142/Intersellar-009.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-425023749\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/15/1387110384943/Intersellar-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/15/131215Trailer-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/15/131215Trailer_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/15/131215Trailer/131215Trailer.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/15//131215Trailer.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/15/131215Trailer_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Interstellar.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the clunkiness of its dialogue (would an astronaut really need to have wormholes explained to him just as he approached one?) and ludicrousness of its plot (I can only accept the final 15 minutes if it’s all an illusion – which I suspect it isn’t), <em>Interstellar</em> is the work of someone who dreams with their eyes wide open. There is no one working in cinema today who has as much faith in the overwhelming power of the image as Nolan and who trusts their audience to be similarly awestruck. Like visionary film-maker Douglas Trumbull (who conjured <em>2001</em>’s most memorable effects), Nolan’s primary register is light, and one can legitimately trace his love of celluloid back to the earliest experiments of Georges Méliès, who first used movies to send us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JDaOOw0MEE\"><em>A Trip to the Moon</em></a><em> </em>in 1902. Watching <em>Insterstellar</em>, I felt connected to a century of mind-boggling spectacular cinema – to films such as <em>The Ten Commandments</em>, <em>The Robe </em>and <em>Ben-Hur, </em>which made you catch your breath at the sheer scope and intensity of the imagery. As Roy Batty says in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/blade-runner\"><em>Blade Runner</em></a><em>: </em>“I have seen things you people wouldn’t believe...”</p> <p>Whether such ocular delights are enough to assuage any anxieties about the plot remains a moot point. Critics and audiences turned their noses up at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/27/transcendence-review-grand-ideas-johnny-depp-wally-pfister\"><em>Transcendence</em></a>, the directorial debut from Nolan’s long-time director of photography Wally Pfister (here replaced by keen-eyed Hoyte van Hoytema) which was sneeringly dismissed by many as “<em>Inception</em>-lite”. Yet there is nothing in Pfister’s nostalgically ambitious directorial debut that is any more foolish than the heavily signposted twists and turns of Nolan’s latest.</p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\"><em>Gravity</em></a><em> </em>may have seemed philosophically flimsier, but it made more sense (and arguably pushed the visual effects envelope further) than <em>Interstellar</em>. Nolan’s regular composer Hans Zimmer has the measure of the madness, cooking up an eerie score that swerves from the creaky Goblin-esque horrors of mid-period Dario Argento to the imposing hallelujahs of what sounds like a massive church organ.</p> <p>While the end result may not represent the pinnacle of Nolan’s extraordinary career, it nevertheless reaffirms him as cinema’s leading blockbuster auteur, a director who can stamp his singular vision on to every frame of a gargantuan team effort in the manner of Spielberg, Cameron and Kubrick. “Whose subconscious are we in?” asked Ellen Page in <em>Inception</em>. The answer here, as always, is unmistakably Nolan’s.</p>","headline":"Interstellar review – if it’s spectacle you want, this delivers","trailText":"Despite a plot full of holes of various kinds,

Images of fish and fowl flutter across the screen, evoking a growing sense of freedom, the songs of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/shopping.popandrock2\" title=\"\">2007 album <em>Home Again</em></a> (recorded before his stroke, but mixed after) and the sounds of Collins’s plaintive soundtrack reconfirming his vibrant musical charms. Through it all, Grace is his rock, his muse, his inspiration; I honestly can’t remember when I last saw a happier screen couple.</p>","headline":"The Possibilities Are Endless review – Edwyn Collins

Fuelled by booze, insecurity and egotistical self-pity, the Welsh legend alternately enthrals and appals all who fall into his circle – a splash of gaudy colour amid a buttoned-down, monochrome world (<em>Downton Abbey</em> graduate Andy Goddard opts for nostalgic black and white with handsome results). While the film never matches or captures the unruly power of its subject (Thomas’s poetry is recited but remains a distant voice), there are evocative moments – a late-night Connecticut session swapping ghost stories with an arch Shirley Henderson is a highlight. Gruff Rhys’s music adds textural melancholy, making this an intriguing double bill companion piece to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/american-interior\" title=\"\"><em>American

a natural affinity between Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig in this moody indie pic</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Suicide is no laughing matter, but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie-pic about self-destructive siblings. Kristen Wiig is typically engaging as Maggie, nominally trying for a baby with super-straight husband Lance (Luke Wilson), now providing shelter for slashed-wrist survivor Milo (Bill Hader), the estranged brother to whom she has not spoken in a decade. Both Milo and Maggie are emotional wrecks and it’s clear that their time together will reopen and heal old wounds. It could prove insufferable, but Wiig and Hader have developed a natural affinity over years of working together that enables them to play their love-hate sister-brother intimacy with ease. Full marks, too, to Wilson for making the most of a dorky fall-guy role, into which he injects genuine sympathy – you may not love Lance but he’s as easy to like as his perennially unsatisfied wife insists.</p>","headline":"The Skeleton Twins review – Kristen Wiig is engaging in this tale of self-destructive siblings","trailText":"There’s a natural affinity between Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig in this moody indie pic, writes <strong>Mark Kermode</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415276270797/skeleton-twins-003.jpg","wordcount":"143","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Mark Kermode, Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-30T11:04:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/09/the-skeleton-twins-review-kristen-wiig","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/09/the-skeleton-twins-review-kristen-wiig","tags":[{"id":"film/the-skeleton-twins","webTitle":"The Skeleton Twins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-skeleton-twins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/the-skeleton-twins","references":[]},{"id":"film/kristen-wiig","webTitle":"Kristen Wiig","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-wiig","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/kristen-wiig","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kermode","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/markkermode","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/markkermode","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-b14f2599-75f1-4b44-beb9-b2a87cd0efcb","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415276276422/skeleton-twins-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Skeleton Twins, LLC.","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415276276422/skeleton-twins-008.jpg","source":"PR","photographer":"Courtesy of Skeleton Twins, LLC.","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"skeleton twins","suppliersReference":"THE SKELETON TWINS","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Courtesy of Skeleton Twins, LLC./PR","caption":"Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig in The Skeleton Twins: ‘they portray their love-hate sister-brother intimacy with ease’.

But if so, what sort of classic?</p> <p>The thin story of a seasoned, philosophical homicide cop (Barry Fitzgerald) and his callow young partner (Don Taylor) pursuing a murder involving a gang of New York jewel thieves invites the categorisation of police procedural. Director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/02/obituaries.mainsection\" title=\"\">Jules Dassin</a> and screenwriter Albert Maltz were both blacklisted after defying the House Un-American Activities Committee, and while the film reflects Dassin’s unpatronising feeling for everyday New Yorkers and Maltz’s conviction that corruption reaches down from the city’s upper classes to the criminal underclass, the social criticism is rather mild. The movie was shot almost entirely on the streets of New York and takes its title from a collection of sensational photographs of crime scenes and bizarre street life by the cameraman who signed his work <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/jan/19/weegee-murder-photographs-pictures-new-york\" title=\"\">Weegee</a>. But it is little influenced by his rawness and only occasionally takes on the expressionistic manner and edgy psychopathology of the film noir with which Dassin and the movie’s producer Mark Hellinger have been associated.</p> <p>Instead, the picture is a curious hybrid in which all of the above is subsumed into a film inspired by Walter Ruttmann’s classic 1927 documentary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j76FNxsJlt8\" title=\"\"><em>Berlin, Symphony of a Great City</em></a>. The hero of <em>The Naked City</em> is New York itself, forever encapsulated during the hot summer of 1947. Its citizens are the unknowing supporting cast. The film deliberately forgoes the noir director’s opportunities to dramatically frame the scenes and Hellinger provides a knowing, intimate, folksy commentary on the action that domesticates the narrative and deliberately undermines the suspense. As he casually concludes: “There are eight million stories in the Naked City. This has been one of them.” This is what makes the film both a landmark and some sort of masterpiece.</p> <p>The disc’s extras include a commentary by Malvin Wald (author of the original screenplay), a history of New York in the cinema, and a partisan 1950 documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3MlaFIzCw8\" title=\"\">on the Hollywood Ten</a>.</p>","headline":"The Naked City review – Philip French on Jules Dassin’s curious police procedural","trailText":"New York’s streets take the starring role in this landmark 40s crime thriller, writes <strong>Philip French</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415186712413/The-Naked-City-classic-DV-003.jpg","wordcount":"360","commentable":"true","byline":"Philip French","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-29T11:20:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/09/naked-city-review-jules-dassin-police-procedural-philip-french-classic-dvd","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/09/naked-city-review-jules-dassin-police-procedural-philip-french-classic-dvd","tags":[{"id":"film/series/philip-french-classic-dvd","webTitle":"Philip French's classic DVD","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/philip-french-classic-dvd","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/philip-french-classic-dvd","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"film/dvdreviews","webTitle":"DVD and video reviews","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dvdreviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/dvdreviews","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/philipfrench","webTitle":"Philip French","rcsId":"GNL110437","r2ContributorId":"16284","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/philip_french_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"french","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philipfrench","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/philipfrench","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-a668bcd9-0fec-42e8-91dd-4de8c429ccf0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415186717326/The-Naked-City-classic-DV-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"RONALD GRANT","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415186717326/The-Naked-City-classic-DV-008.jpg","source":"Ronald Grant Archive","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"The Naked City, classic DVD","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive","caption":"'Some sort of masterpiece': Barry Fitzgerald, Don Taylor, Howard Duff and Dorothy Hart in The Naked City.

It flickers to life when star John Lloyd Young approximates Valli’s helium croon on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzpWKAGvGdA\" title=\"\">Can’t Take My Eyes Off You</a> – what film couldn’t? – but this is otherwise a notably squandered opportunity.</p> <p>There is as much to be said about the over-milked X-Men franchise at this point as there is to be explored in the films themselves: very little indeed. Still, <strong>X-Men: Days of Future Past</strong> (Fox, 12) is rarely less than proficient, and occasionally alights upon a poppy visual concept that evokes the comic books whence these gargantuan, machine-tooled blockbusters came. Viewers not already waist-deep in this series, however, need not apply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42fab36bfd7ee1d7d8e7440d768c7e69aa1987ef\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415200843634/55c46d55-b096-4647-ae3e-d946c19d5688-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Melissa McCarthy in the 'sweetly misshapen' Tammy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa McCarthy in the ‘sweetly misshapen’ Tammy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same might be said of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\" title=\"\">Melissa McCarthy</a> fans and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/06/tammy-review-melissa-mccarthy-susan-sarandon-comedy-road-movie\" title=\"\"><strong>Tammy</strong></a> (Warner, 15). As a paid-up admirer of the star’s bumptious comic shtick, I found much to enjoy in this sweetly misshapen road movie that sees McCarthy’s loud-mouthed, laid-off fast-food drone setting off for Niagara Falls to find some approximation of herself, with her randy grandmother (a spirited but years-too-young Susan Sarandon) in tow. Yet it’s harder to pinpoint the film’s specific virtues than it is to accept its predictable geniality; McCarthy wrote it herself, with husband Ben Falcone, but one can’t help feeling she’s sold herself a bit short.</p> <p>The week’s best foreign language release is perhaps its least glamorous: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/29/the-golden-dream-review-harrowing-migrants-journey\" title=\"\"><strong>The Golden Dream</strong></a> (Saffron Hill, 12) is a maudlin title for director Diego Quemada Diaz’s bracingly tough immigrant song, in which a trio of Guatemalan teens set off on a long, troubled trek to the US.

Yet with its tragicomic scenes of corrupt mayors working their foul deeds beneath iconic portraits of Vladimir Putin, and drunken policeman using pictures of former leaders for target practice (the current ones “need more historical perspective”), <em>Leviathan</em> seems to have slipped under the authorities’ totalitarian radar. Indeed, Andrey Zvyagintsev’s unremittingly poisonous portrait of the abuse of power in contemporary Russia has been submitted as the country’s official entry for next year’s foreign language film Oscar – a rather more open-minded approach to dissenting art than that which greeted Pussy Riot, whose name appears briefly on the TV news in an almost subliminal act of covert subversion.</p> <p>Significantly accompanied by the circling strains of Philip Glass’s <em>Akhnaten</em> – an opera about a monotheistic Egyptian pharaoh that echoes the church/state hegemony of Zvyagintsev and co-writer Oleg Negin’s narrative – <em>Leviathan</em> transposes the ancient trials of Job to the modern Kola peninsula via Thomas Hobbes’s 1651 book, to which the screenplay directly alludes. Aleksey Serebryakov is the beleaguered Kolya who is left crying: “Why, Lord?” after his attempts to stop local despot Vadim (Roman Madyanov) evicting him from his coastal family home lead to alcohol-sodden despair. Yet there is no God here, just the Russian Orthodox priest who encourages Vadim to view his earthly powers as heaven-sent, and whose sanctimonious ministrations serve only to keep the masses duly downtrodden.</p> <p>“A story of love and tragedy experienced by ordinary people” is how producer Alexander Rodnyansky characterises this fearsomely believable tale of lives crushed and torn apart by bloated authority – as vast, empty and lifeless as the enigmatic whalebones that adorn the beach. As with its various sources (biblical, literary, political), this is a tale of the epic and the everyday, of big themes and little people – “insects” to the likes of Vadim and his unholy flock.</p> <p>As with <em>The Return</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/17/drama\" title=\"\"><em>The Banishment</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144081/elena\" title=\"\"><em>Elena</em></a>, Zvyagintsev exhibits an extraordinary eye for the class-inflected details of intimate family life, the personal and the political perfectly intertwined, albeit to rather more forthright purpose here than elsewhere in his back catalogue. There is laughter, too, of a bleakly Orwellian nature, particularly during the courtroom scenes in which Kolya’s case is reduced to high-speed legalese by an automaton judge who appears significantly not to breathe. No wonder the characters spend so much time obliterating themselves with vodka, the only spirit on offer in this purgatorial world. It’s visceral, rebellious fare. Let’s hope it repeats the success of Nikita Mikhalkov’s 1994 <em>Burnt by the Sun</em> and takes home the trophy at the Academy awards.</p>","headline":"Leviathan review – Andrey Zvyagintsev’s

the famed <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf theatre company</a>.

Along with recreations of work by <a href=\"http://www.mapplethorpe.org/\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/IrvingPennArchives\">Irving Penn</a> and <a href=\"http://andresserrano.org/\">Andres Serrano</a>, Miller also paid homage to masters of commercial photography like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/07/photography.art\">Annie Leibovitz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carlfischerphotography.com/\">Carl Fischer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.herbritts.com/\">Herb Ritts</a>. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b095e6b62f4eb7e722d895aac80583b2d28ff90\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415391836895/0756f629-15f6-4d53-89aa-b4563896613e-460x432.jpeg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol – Green Marilyn (1962).\" width=\"460\" height=\"432\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Warhol – Green Marilyn (1962).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandro Miller courtesy of Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago/Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Chicago show suggests that art is not removed from the culture which it examines. There is little difference here between a great ad and great art. “Even in the art world, you have to create symmetries that connect to people, that make them want to discuss or to learn more about that imagery,” Miller said. “In advertising, I learned how to take images that truly resonated with people.”</p> <p>An<a href=\"http://www.georgelois.com/pages/Esquire/Esq.Ali.html\"> Esquire cover of Muhammad Ali,</a> then, is as relevant to the way we see the world as a Marilyn Monroe print by Andy Warhol. Great creators can be found in commercial, artistic and journalistic worlds. <br /></p> <p>Miller is not just a photographer: he is also a meticulous researcher. His latest collaboration with Malkovich took a year to co-ordinate. No detail was left unstudied. Although they acquired some props used in the original photographs, most of Miller’s time was spent recreating the small details – the shaggy rug in <a href=\"http://tsunamibooks.jimdo.com/2014/01/09/simone-de-beauvoir-the-outrageous-106-years/\">Art Shay’s 1950 photograph of Simone de Beauvoir</a>, the rugged sweater worn by a woman in <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/dorothea-lange-migrant-mother-nipomo-california-1936\">Dorothea Lange’s Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California</a>, from 1936. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c963d1abc49f6f92c3438e74c94c5ca87fa58efa\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415391916632/8f113f64-ed17-45d0-9fd3-518cdc700553-1020x1020.jpeg\" alt=\"Arthur Sasse – Albert Einstein Sticking Out His Tongue (1951).\" width=\"1020\" height=\"1020\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur Sasse – Albert Einstein Sticking Out His Tongue (1951).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandro Miller courtesy of Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago/Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The longest part was getting the right kind of props, the sets, the correct hair, the makeup,” Miller said. “So much of that had to be made. The wardrobe required seamstresses. We had to build most of the settings.”</p> <p>The shoot was squeezed into four 15-hour days. “There was no experimenting. There was no practicing. Everything was thought out and extremely tight,” said Miller. “We knew what we had to do.”</p> <p>At first, Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich is funny. Here is Malkovich, raw and unrefined. His age is pronounced; wrinkles line his mouth and cheeks. His skin sags and bags droop under his eyes. He is a remarkable physical specimen. </p> <p>But the show is not a parody. And it takes a true, transformative figure eventually to blend into the image itself. These are iconic images and this show makes us see them afresh. Its real story is that a truly powerful picture can last forever.</p> <p><em>• Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich is at Catherine Edelman gallery, Chicago, until 31 January. <a href=\"http://edelmangallery.com/exhibitions-and-projects/exhibition-pages/2014/sandro-miller-malkovich,-malkovich,-malkovich-homage-to-photographic-masters.html\">More details here</a></em><br /></p>","headline":"Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich: a tribute to the power of the image","trailText":"A show in which John Malkovich recreates famous photographs of the past is funny – but its real subject is the way images permeate public consciousness<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415390914584/35646d58-be66-434c-b716-d9364e39b613-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"726","commentable":"true","byline":"Britt Julious","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-11T13:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago","tags":[{"id":"film/john-malkovich","webTitle":"John Malkovich","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/john-malkovich","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/john-malkovich","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/photography","webTitle":"Photography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/photography","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/britt-julious","webTitle":"Britt Julious","r2ContributorId":"64995","firstName":"britt","lastName":"julious","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Chicago-based writer and founder of Inland magazine.

Yeah, it’s coming in <strong>(2)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>You narrate a new documentary about </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao\"><strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong></a><strong>. Do you think you’re similar, in that you’re both respected in your fields, but you’re reaching the age limit for your best-known work?</strong></p> <p>That’s a strange comparison. Manny’s, what, 34? I hope to be doing this when I’m 90, you know. If you think that 62 is way past the age of acting, then …</p> <p><strong>No, no (3)! I meant the action stuff.</strong></p> <p>Oh, the action stuff. Well, 60 is the new 40, so I’m not going to complain.</p> <p><strong>Can you relate to Manny?</strong></p> <p>I was a boxer as a kid, from the age of nine to about 17. But Manny was brought up in a fucking shack with rebels firing guns and stuff. He was facing death on a daily basis. And not having food to eat! That’s rock, rock bottom. What a foundation to build your future on; there’s nowhere to go but up. So, when he fights, beside his natural talent – which is phenomenal – you’ve got this fucking anger. But it’s a very controlled anger. He’s fighting not just for himself, but for all of the Philippines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqi_DVcSMPY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qqi_DVcSMPY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The official trailer for Manny, the Neeson-narrated documentary about Manny Pacquiao.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How were you as a boxer?</strong></p> <p>I was an amateur. I won a few titles. Looking back, I’d say I was competent.</p> <p><strong>Did you have a nickname or anything?</strong></p> <p>Nope. I wasn’t a knockout specialist. I had a good left jab and I just used that a lot. Not exactly a crowd-pleaser.</p> <p><strong>Have you seen any of Pacquiao’s acting roles (4)?</strong></p> <p>No I haven’t. I saw a sample of them on the documentary and it threw me a little bit. I thought, OK … maybe let’s save those for another day.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever had any projects like that, where you haven’t necessarily played to your strongest skills?</strong></p> <p>I did a movie once that nobody saw, called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKe2-vUQ1s\">Duet For One</a>. It was based on the life of Jacqueline du Pré, a violinist who suffered from multiple sclerosis. It was Julie Andrews, lovely Alan Bates, Max von Sydow and myself. Julie Andrews was playing Jacqueline du Pré. I played her sort of lover, a third-rate singer in a working men’s club. There’s a scene where I’m singing The Green, Green Grass of Home, and I’ve never been more nervous in all my life. Oh, my knees were shaking. Fuck me, I’m singing to Julie Andrews, you know? She can hold a tune.</p> <p><strong>That </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ1O6BEVP3k&amp;t=6m5s\"><strong>must be on YouTube, surely</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>Oh God, it won’t be.

The film doesn’t spend very long on his gambling or rumoured infidelities.</strong></p> <p>I know. But I think he more than hinted that he’d had a few flings. He obviously did. And his wife did, too, without saying it. We don’t need to know any more than that. This is a kid who grew up in the fucking jungle with nothing to eat. So, OK, it went to his head. He won all those world titles and he strayed a bit. He’s only human. I didn’t really want to see what his gambling debts may have been, you know? It’s powerful. You see him being vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>It ends on the biggest moment of vulnerability of all (6).</strong></p> <p>That fucking knockout. I remember watching that. I saw it on TV, I was on my own. I froze. I thought he was dead. I wondered if someone in the audience had shot him. He dropped like a tree. Fuck me, what a punch. Jesus wept.</p> <p><strong>Do you think he’ll ever retire?</strong></p> <p>I think he will. The doorman at my building is an ex-boxer and we’re always arguing. He says, “I think Manny’s got four more fights in him.” I say, “Four? Fuck me, he doesn’t have four more fights.” Maybe two. But I hope it’s just one and that’s it. He’s certainly fit enough for four, but that’s when he could get hurt. That’s the danger.</p> <p><strong>Last question. It seems like it’d be a waste if I had Liam Neeson on the phone and he didn’t threaten me …</strong></p> <p>Ugh, I can’t do that, mate. If I had 25 cents for every time I left a message on my son’s answer machine … No. No, I can’t do that <strong>(7)</strong>.</p> <p>• <em>Manny is released on video on demand on 17 November</em></p> <p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <p><strong>1)</strong> This is code for: “I don’t know what that means.”</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Nope, still no idea.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Imagine the most panicky voice in the world.

Hasbro also has licenses to produce toys based on film franchises including Spider-Man and Avengers Assemble, while in a strong earnings call earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/21/hasbro-results-idUSL3N0ND21U20140421\">the company attributed</a> The Hunger Games to the popularity of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/nov/12/hunger-games-bow-arrow-toy-girls-catching-fire-christmas\">Rebelle series</a> of Nerf bows and arrows aimed at girls.</p> <p>If successful, Hasbro’s purchase would create a perfectly symbiotic match: merchandising opportunities for DreamWorks pictures furnished by Hasbro, while Hasbro provides a steady stream of potential intellectual property to mine for films – if the likes of Furreal Friends’ cuddy puppy Get Up and Go-Go can indeed be called intellectual property.</p> <p>Snobbery perhaps, but the paucity of new ideas in Hollywood is leading to some shameless toy-inspired films. Hasbro’s card game Magic: The Gathering, last seen being played in a classroom that bullies weren’t aware of, is being adapted by Fox. Meanwhile, Sony is developing Hasbros’ board game Candy Land, a cornerstone of many American childhoods that treats the dice-roll board game with an almost experimental level of minimalism. My Little Pony is already being turned into a new animated movie, Battleship became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/12/battleship-review\">a predictably formulaic action flick</a>, while Hasbro once had a Stretch Armstrong movie being prepped, set to “find a real emotional connection and resonance”, according to its creators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-71195b0b-f23c-4719-b1a5-a019e61ec773\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415882850174/3bd8f9ff-3112-41aa-b524-6f11ffc6cd75-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Transformers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transformers: Age of Extinction, based on Hasbro’s toy line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At their worst, these turn potential film art into extended infomercials – but they don’t have to be terrible. Ridley Scott was once lined up to direct a Monopoly movie about, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1637799/monopoly-movie-will-be-all-about-greed-ridley-scott-reveals/\">in his words</a>, “some horrible property scam guy”, which in the wake of the financial crisis could have been just loopy enough to work – and let’s not forget that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie\">The Lego Movie</a> was far, far better than many expected.</p> <p>So what might Hasbro tackle next? Surely their Nerf weapons are crying out to be the final scrape of the Hunger Games barrel, in the wake of The Maze Runner, Divergent et al – but any film must be set in a world where light retinal injuries from foam darts can prove instantly fatal. The infernal compulsiveness of Bop It! could be perfect for a study of human obsession starring Russell Crowe, with Jack Black as the voice of Bop It! Jenga could form the core of Christopher Nolan’s next inquiry into layered reality, The Game of Life could be the perfect sequel project for Terrence Malick, and Operation could either go for a Saw-style splatter-fest or a melancholy Ron Howard medical drama about a surgeon with Parkinson’s disease. </p> <p>Will we eventually end up exhausting every toy and game, until we’re left with Bela Tarr making a seven-hour film about the perpetual struggle of Snap? Perhaps. And with each new adaptation, Hollywood further underlines just how un-interactive its product is, and lacking in playful imagination its producers can be.</p>","headline":"Hasbro toys with buying DreamWorks – and shows Hollywood is played out","trailText":"Hasbro, the second-largest toy company in the US, is set for a merger with DreamWorks’ animation arm, potentially leading to a deluge of cash-in movie hybrids, from Bop It! to Jenga","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415883221646/a19ec81c-fd81-4183-99b2-f1bda5c54106-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"543","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-20T06:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/13/hasbro-toys-dreamworks-animation-merger","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/13/hasbro-toys-dreamworks-animation-merger","tags":[{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/toys","webTitle":"Toys","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/toys","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/toys","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-lego-movie","webTitle":"The Lego Movie","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/the-lego-movie","references":[]},{"id":"film/transformers-age-of-extinction","webTitle":"Transformers: Age of Extinction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/transformers-age-of-extinction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/transformers-age-of-extinction","references":[]},{"id":"film/sony-pictures","webTitle":"Sony Pictures","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sony-pictures","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sony-pictures","references":[]},{"id":"film/20th-century-fox","webTitle":"20th Century Fox","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/20th-century-fox","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/20th-century-fox","references":[]},{"id":"film/paramount-pictures","webTitle":"Paramount Pictures","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paramount-pictures","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/paramount-pictures","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/games","webTitle":"Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/games","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/games","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","firstName":"ben","lastName":"beaumont-thomas","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.

consider myself something resembling an adult. I pay my taxes. I know how to drive an automobile. I can preheat an oven without any supervision. And yet, when it comes to cinematic representation of human flatulence, I find myself giggling like a kid in the back row during fourth-period social studies.</p> <p>Funnier even than the sound of the expelled gas vibrating its way past buttock flesh is any sort of detailed discussion of the gastrointestinal wind’s contours or qualities. If it can be assumed that the effluvium is particularly malodorous, and if someone is confined in a space with no access to outside ventilation, as is the case with poor <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/11/12/how-they-camouflaged-rob-riggle-in-dumb-and-dumber-to/\">Rob Riggle</a> who finds himself on the business end of both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels’s rectum during a scene in Dumb and Dumber To, well, you can just forget about it. No clever satirist, regardless of their verbal dexterity, can ever hope to best such a thing in terms of pure laughs.</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong – I take no pride in this confession. But my mind’s got a mind of its own, and I’d be lying if I said this movie didn’t crack me up on more than a few occasions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86526f822d62e7fec5870ff963b21e9b34970866\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415880084321/28b1b24b-c63a-4f98-8a47-cacf77ce267f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dumb and Dumber\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dumb and Dumber To is remarkably true to the original – down to the cheap sets and half-assed plot. It takes a while to get rolling, but once Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) hit the road for another absurd caper, it’s wall-to-wall buffoonery. The twin numbskulls bumble their way from Rhode Island to El Paso (named for the bean dip!) to try and find Harry’s long-lost daughter. You see, Harry needs a kidney transplant or he’s gonna die. (I told you this was hilarious!) The daughter was put up for adoption by Harry’s ex-flame (a very brusque Kathleen Turner) and raised by a science genius who is up for an award at the “Ken Conference” (clearly modelled on the TED Conference but, as you may or may not know, Ks are funny.) Our heroes have to get there, and also save the day from baddies giving chase to steal “a billion-dollar idea” from the stepfather inventor. And if I spend any more time detailing this ridiculous plot then, truly, the joke’s on me.</p> <p>Harry and Lloyd charge into each social encounter like bulls in a china shop. Keeping matters fresh is the wide spectrum to their styles of idiocy. Sometimes one is clearly dumber than the other. Sometimes they are angry put-down artists. Then they swiftly pivot into full-blown morons, drinking embalming fluid believing it to be a slushie. Daniels gets most of his laughs from being loud and clumsy, but Jim Carrey is still a rubberfaced marvel. The Farrelly Brothers realise that they’ve got gold on their hands and are extremely generous to him. One sequence is just a collection of Carrey mugging in close-up until his off-screen scene partner (foil Rob Riggle) ultimately interjects and asks: “What are you doing?” No answer proper answer is given, and the film just picks up where it left off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfwLKDifqNA\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfwLKDifqNA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In one champion moment, Carrey squeezes laughs from simply eating a hot dog in a weird way, even if there’s no real motivation for the behaviour. The move involves loading the dog with mustard, biting the edges from outside the bun, then chomping a little of the bun, then sliding the rest of the tube down past pursed lips, then using the remainder of the bun as a napkin to get the mustard off his face, then tossing the bun away. It’s an outstanding bit of unexpected physical comedy and Charlie Chaplin himself couldn’t do much better.</p> <p>None of this is to say that Dumb and Dumber To isn’t what you’d typically call a good movie. The movie cracks nonstop jokes and plenty of them just die on the screen. There’s no shortage of callbacks to the first film, some of which work better than others.</p> <p>The picture lasts an hour and 50 minutes but it feels like three days. It is annoying and exhausting, and I honestly couldn’t tell you whether or not this is part of the Farrellys’ twisted design. During one ceaseless sequence I actually muttered: “Ugh, I can’t take any more!” and my colleague seated beside me chuckled in agreement. We were laughing, but by God did we want to get out of there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/15/my-guilty-pleasure-dumb-and-dumber-farrelly-brothers\">• My guilty pleasure: Dumb and Dumber</a></p>","headline":"Dumb and Dumber To review – the bottom line: it's still funny","trailText":"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels resume their slapstick double-act 20 years on, but despite some inspired work with a hot dog, this half-assed sequel leaves you feeling numb and number","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415879513346/Dumb-and-Dumber-To-jeff-d-006.jpg","wordcount":"741","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-13T11:38:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/dumb-and-dumber-to-review-jim-carrey-jeff-daniels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/13/dumb-and-dumber-to-review-jim-carrey-jeff-daniels","tags":[{"id":"film/dumb-and-dumber-to","webTitle":"Dumb and Dumber To","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/jimcarrey","webTitle":"Jim Carrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jimcarrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/jimcarrey","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

It doesn’t go that well: they’re chased away by locals, Slim gets shot off his horse, and Willis has to escape by plunging into a river. In future, Willis and Glasscock conclude, they should avoid daytime holdups. Glasscock, a nitroglycerin expert, suggests they blow up safes at night. In 1919, when this scene is set, Willis Newton was 30 years old. He had established a criminal career of bank and train robbery as well as burglary, forgery and other offences. It was in 1920 that he and Glasscock set up their safebusting “business”, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p> <h2>Technology</h2> <p>The key to the Newton gang’s success was identifying square-door safes. Glasscock devised a nitroglycerin system detonated by a dynamite “cap” that would simply blow the door off. As the film correctly illustrates, this limited them to robbing smaller banks. By the 1920s, most larger banks in the US had gone over to round-door safes, which were harder to break into. Willis persuades an actual banker to give him a list of all the square-door safe banks in nearby states. “We promise never to rob your little bank,” he says with a winning smile – and it’s a deal. In real life, Willis did indeed acquire such a list from an official from the Texas Association of Bankers. Naughtily, the man sold it to him.</p> <h2>Money</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4b86cd17335819cf01e4f1b4bbf0058fea13612\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415808622608/80dde44d-697f-4183-9442-1b7d07ea3dcb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Newton gang’s spoils of thievery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Newton gang’s spoils of thievery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruising around in a banana-yellow Studebaker he bought with his ill-gotten gains (the film is right that the gang always drove Studebakers or Cadillacs), Willis puts together a gang. It consists of his brothers Dock (Vincent D’Onofrio), Jess (Ethan Hawke) and Joe (Skeet Ulrich). Joe, the youngest, is the most earnest: “You’re talking about taking people’s money,” he says, horrified. “No,” replies Willis, “the <em>bank’s</em> money … We are just little thieves stealing from the big thieves. That’s all.” Joe isn’t convinced, and nor is an old woman living next to the bank they rob straight afterwards. “That’s my money in that bank!” she hollers at the Newtons. They threaten to blow her building up. Undeterred, she lets off a fire siren – but the boys get away.</p> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Though the Newtons’ claim that they never actually killed anyone has not been conclusively disproved, they were violent criminals. The film prefers to portray them as lovable folk heroes, and it is right that witnesses at some of their robberies described them as surprisingly polite. Even so, it cannot disguise the fact that they did on occasion shoot, pistol-whip and beat their victims. It’s all very well to turn that into slapstick comedy on screen – but in real life, <a href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?Willis-Newtons-First-Train-Robbery---1914&amp;id=8390112\">newspaper reports suggest</a> that encounters with the Newtons could result in distinctly non-comic injuries. “Sure, we shot a few people, but we never killed a single man,” the real Willis Newton said later.</p> <h2>Justice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e572f74b317728c23cbd1f3832255ff7a52ff05\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415808422408/bdaf2463-8356-449b-8ac7-573ab71fd36d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Rondout train robbery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rondout train robbery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Newton gang’s last and greatest heist was the <a href=\"http://www.historyillinois.com/files/Markers/marker.php?marker_id=369\">Rondout train robbery</a>, which took place near Chicago on 12 June 1924. The Newtons and Glasscock were involved; a corrupt postal inspector, William J Fahy (David Jensen), was their man on the inside. It was estimated that the gang took more than $2m, making this the biggest train robbery in US history at the time. The brothers were all caught and given fairly light sentences, as the film shows; Fahy took most of the blame. The Newton gang ceased to operate in 1924, but it does not appear they entirely learned their lesson. The real Dock was arrested in 1968, at the age of 77, in the act of robbing a bank. The real Willis was accused of involvement in another bank robbery in 1973, when he was 84 – but there was not enough evidence to arrest him.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>It hits an amiable tone and the period detail is beautifully observed – but The Newton Boys is too meandering a narrative, with too generic a cast of characters, to make for a gripping movie.</p>","headline":"The Newton Boys: ruthless bandits, not lovable folk heroes","trailText":"These four bank-robbing Texan brothers did drive flash cars and invent new safe-cracking methods, but Richard Linklater’s slapstick overlooks the real-life violence they inflicted on their victims, writes <strong>Alex von Tunzelmann</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2014/11/12/1415807695541/The-Newton-Boys-004.jpg","wordcount":"778","commentable":"true","byline":"Alex von Tunzelmann","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-19T15:49:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/13/reel-history-the-newton-boys-richard-linklater-matthew-mcconaughey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/13/reel-history-the-newton-boys-richard-linklater-matthew-mcconaughey","tags":[{"id":"film/series/reelhistory","webTitle":"Reel history","description":"The historian Alex von Tunzelmann watches classics of big screen history and prises fact from fiction","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/reelhistory","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/reelhistory","references":[]},{"id":"film/matthew-mcconaughey","webTitle":"Matthew McConaughey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/matthew-mcconaughey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/matthew-mcconaughey","references":[]},{"id":"film/ethan-hawke","webTitle":"Ethan Hawke","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ethan-hawke","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/ethan-hawke","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-crime","webTitle":"US crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-crime","references":[]},{"id":"film/richard-linklater","webTitle":"Richard Linklater","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/richard-linklater","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexvontunzelmann","webTitle":"Alex von Tunzelmann","r2ContributorId":"25529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/21/alex_vontunzelmann_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"vontunzelmann","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alex von Tunzelmann is a historian and writer.

Our own Peter Bradshaw, who gave it the full five stars, called the film “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\">thrillingly, dangerously new</a>”.</p> <p>I’m sorry, Peter. I’m sorry, everyone else. It’s a stinker. And that stink emanates almost entirely from one element: the bow-legged, squint-eyed, Selleck-moustached, fruity-voiced Daniel Plainview, as incarnated by modern cinema’s greatest exponent of industrial-scale ham, Daniel Day-Lewis.</p> <p>Day-Lewis is an acting behemoth, the only person in history to bag three Oscars for best actor (the middle one came for TWBB). These days, his very presence in a film denotes heft, seriousness, intent, a producer’s eyes firmly fixed on the awards season. There’s just one problem: he’s awful.</p> <p>It wasn’t ever thus. The young Day-Lewis had his moments. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83399/my-beautiful-laundrette\">My Beautiful Laundrette</a> he might not have been the most convincing London punk ever, but possessed charm, almost a lightness of touch. As Cecil Vyse in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/a-room-with-a-view\">A Room With a View</a> he was unrecognisable as a bumbling snob.</p> <p>But the longer his career has progressed, the more heavily weighted with statuettes the Day-Lewis mantelpiece, the more he has become leaden, mannered, affected, a legend in his own ham-heavy lunchtime.</p> <p>Before TWBB the low point was Bill “the Butcher” Cutting, from the similarly overpraised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gangs-of-new-york\">Gangs of New York</a>. He is a distant cousin to Plainview, with his luxuriantly foliaged upper lip, accent that sounds like John Gielgud auditioning for Taxi, and absurdly contrived, over-the-top outbursts. To this day I can’t hear the phrase <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVggUxEgv5k\">“Whoopsy daisy!”</a> without an inward flinch.</p> <p>Many people, Bradshaw included, explicitly enjoy Day-Lewis’s opulent approach, seeing it as a welcome contrast to today’s dominant, mumbled naturalism. But to my mind it has become so absurd, so elaborate – and let’s not even get into Day-Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2244230/Lincoln-Daniel-Day-Lewis-didnt-break-character-THREE-months-Spielberg-called-Mr-President.html\">infamous method-acting mania</a> – that all else about a film withers in its oppressive shade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2008/jul/04/1\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/xng3e\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"995909\"                data-video-name=\"There Will Be Blood: the deleted scene\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-335487811\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1648070578_gdn-nat-080704-jd-therewillbeblood2-16x9.flv\"></source> </video> <figcaption>There Will Be Blood: the deleted scene</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, TWBB is not all Day-Lewis’s fault. Well, no more than 90%. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, can be erratic but is usually at least interesting - his rambling shaggy dog story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81820/magnolia\">Magnolia</a> remains a favourite film of mine. But here he constructs a film far too much in his lead’s weighty image.</p> <p>What is intended as operatic, almost Biblical – the sociopathic Plainview cutting a swath across the messy and brutal 19th-century oil trade; his struggle with Paul Dano’s charlatan preacher Eli – seems to me just portentous, empty, especially stretched over almost three hours. Even Dano, often so unsettlingly watchable, seems to shrink when faced with the porcine might of his co-lead.</p> <p>Anderson does himself no favours with a ponderous script that, aiming at the epic and almost Shakespearean, tends to land with a splat in the absurd and silly.</p> <p>This is made all the worse by Day-Lewis’s enthusiastic gumming of any scenery in sight, and here his set-piece moments are easily the worst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHz-zZoBnbc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHz-zZoBnbc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Daniel Plainview introduces himself</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take Plainview’s introductory, “I’m an oil man” speech to suspicious locals. The intention is for him to appear sinister, Machiavellian, dangerously charismatic. Instead, mangled by Day-Lewis’s roving accent and gurning face, the address could only be more soporific if it came with an associated PowerPoint presentation.</p> <p>It is in the confrontations with Dano, himself not averse to a touch of fruitiness, where things go badly awry. The culmination is, of course, the “milkshake” scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOEYT0wZFNg\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOEYT0wZFNg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Plainview drinks his milkshake</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here, almost 30 years on from the film’s start, a rich, drink-soaked Plainview accosts and wrestles a whimpering Eli around a bowling alley. Yes, a bowling alley. But this is not before hobbling around like a demented Richard III, pointing his finger into a straw shape and yelling a slightly confused metaphor about dairy-based beverages, ending with the infamous, much-mocked line, “I drink your milkshake!” and a scenery-shaking “Sluuuurrp!” noise.</p> <p>It might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema – Crash still has that tied up – but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance.</p> <p>My personal theory is that Anderson later realised the folly of his ways and so half remade his tale of charismatic sociopaths and their damaged, younger sidekicks/nemeses as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\">The Master</a>.</p> <p>The big difference, of course, is that this film had at its heart the much-mourned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, an actor, like Day-Lewis, also capable of energy and rage, but also blessed with lightness, subtlety, grace, humanity, an ability to know when to hog the spotlight and when to edge back.
