Aren’t names traditionally a parental duty? </strong>Not if you’re Chinese and you want an English name, they’re not.</p> <p><strong>Pardon?</strong> It’s quite common for Chinese people to pick English names for themselves, especially if they are planning to do business with the west. And there’s nothing wrong with that, except that some of the names are, well, getting a little idiosyncratic.</p> <p><strong>How idiosyncratic are we talking? </strong>One local blog devotes itself to finding what it calls the “<a href=\"http://hksarblog.blogspot.hk/search/label/names?updated-max=2013-11-14T00:00:00%2B08:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=160&amp;by-date=false\" title=\"\">HKSAR Name of the Day</a>”, and previous entries have included Quince, Buggle, Dodo and, regrettably, Isis.</p> <p><strong>But they’re isolated incidents, surely. That’s not enough to warrant you bringing it up now. </strong>Tell that to the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, which <a href=\"http://www.cctvnews.cn/2014/10/19/tips-for-chinese-choosing-an-english-name/\" title=\"\">recently published a guide</a> to naming yourself, in the hopes of quelling any more ridiculousness.</p> <p><strong>It did? </strong>Yes. And, to be fair, the advice is just as pertinent for all parents-to-be around the world.</p> <p><strong>Give me some examples. </strong>Well, CCTV says that a “fancy but conservative” name such as Elizabeth or William will make people think that you are from a fancy but conservative background. Alternatively, if you want people to think that you are a stripper, name yourself after a sweet food such as Candy, Cherry or Sugar.</p> <p><strong>So far so good. </strong>They’ve even got a little section about the dangers of ironically using antiquated names such as Gertrude or Percival, which could have been specifically written for anyone currently pregnant in London.</p> <p><strong>Yes, yes, but what about Dumbledore? </strong>It’s a terrible idea, basically. CCTV states that naming yourself after a fictional character only works if “the name is common anyway. Choosing Harry from Harry Potter is OK … Dumbledore is a different story”.</p> <p><strong>Why? </strong>Because it’s hilarious to English speakers, obviously. It’s apparently just as bad as naming yourself Satan or Obama, or something sexual such as Creamy or Pussy.</p> <p><strong>Tell that to my kids, Einstein and Dildo. </strong>You’re a terrible person.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“In accordance with state wishes, I shall henceforth be known as William.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Welcome to Dumbledore, Satan &amp; Beaver-Wang Drainage Solutions. How may I help?”</p>","headline":"Dumbledore, Satan or Percival?

Criticising him for what? </strong>For adopting an anti-EU posture in order to curry favour with the electorate.</p> <p><strong>How dare he! What does he know about running a mid-sized European country into the ground? </strong>He used to be the prime minister of Portugal.</p> <p><strong>Fair enough. What did he actually say? </strong>He said that Cameron’s plan to impose a cap on immigrants from eastern Europe was probably illegal and certainly counterproductive. “It would be an historic mistake if on these issues Britain were to continue to alienate its natural allies in central and eastern Europe,” he said in a speech at Chatham House on Monday, “when you were one of the strongest advocates for their accession.”</p> <p><strong>Ouch. </strong>And the day before he told Andrew Marr that Britain would have “zero influence” if it left the EU.</p> <p><strong>Is it normal for the president of the Commission to be so blunt? </strong>Not really, but he’s leaving.

Especially for children. Parents are frightened of it. Ergo – new name.</p> <p><strong>Hmm. How stupid do they think parents are? </strong>They’ve tweaked the recipe too.</p> <p><strong>Oh, well, fair enough then. Have they taken out all the sugar? </strong>Some. Some of the sugar. Down from nearly two cubes per portion to one and a half. And 20% more honey. Because they’re Honey Monster Puffs.</p> <p><strong>That’s ridiculous. </strong>Only if you concentrate on the fact that honey, though we think and hope it is more natural and beneficial to us, actually acts within the body exactly like ordinary refined sugar.</p> <p><strong>What else is there to concentrate on? </strong>The fact that some cereals, such as Coco Pops and Frosties, contain more than two cubes per portion. The fact that shoppers think and hope honey is more natural and beneficial to them and their children, <em>even though</em> it actually acts within the body <em>exactly</em> like ordinary refined sugar.</p> <p><strong>I see. </strong>AND – that the Honey Monster is back! The lovable, lumbering, furry, yellow fellow who blundered around the childhood adverts of so many of today’s parents who will now trigger lucrative subconscious feelings of trust, loyalty and nostalgia in their offspring-addled brains!</p> <p><strong>Oh yes – “Tell them about the honey, Mummy!” Him? </strong>The very same!</p> <p><strong>Are there going to be new Honey Monster adverts? “Tell them about obesity, Mummy!” “Tell them about the dental cavities, Daddy!” </strong>He will be at the centre of a £3m marketing campaign next year. No word yet on his preferred catchphrases. But probably not those.</p> <p><strong>Do say: “</strong>Tell them about the traffic light nutritional labelling we’ve added to the front of the pack too, Honey Monster!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “You’re preying on the harassed, gullible and uninformed and their children, you monsters.”</p>","headline":"Tell me about the makeover, mummy!

Are they like those fancy Japanese ones that play weird music?</strong> I don’t think so. These cubicles just fly to Mars, land, and then provide food and facilities for a group of human colonists.</p> <p><strong>That’s pretty fancy, even if they look like toilets. </strong>It is indeed.</p> <p><strong>When do they launch?</strong> Well, <a href=\"http://www.mars-one.com\" title=\"\">Mars One</a>, the Dutch non-profit foundation behind the mission, says all the technology already exists, and it reckons it can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/22/mars-one-project-astronauts\" title=\"\">launch the first preliminary expeditions in 2018</a>. The first four settlers will take off in 2024, and land in 2025 after a seven-month journey.</p> <p><strong>Cool! And who will those settlers be?</strong> Well, 200,000 people applied, and 1,058 have made it through to round two. They can be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/19/mars-one-project-human-colony\" title=\"\">any healthy adult in the world</a>, basically, and the final six groups of four will eventually be chosen by an international reality TV contest. There is a catch, however.</p> <p><strong>What kind of catch? </strong>They will never come back.</p> <p><strong>Oh well. A price that some might be willing to pay for such a historic experience.</strong> And there’s another catch.</p> <p><strong>Yes? </strong>They’ll all be dead within a few months.</p> <p><strong>Ah.

They also think that the equipment, designed for zero gravity on the International Space Station, will keep breaking in the gravity on Mars, which is 40% of Earth’s. As a result, the organisers will struggle to send up enough spare parts, let alone the next four people.</p> <p><strong>Tricky. Although those do sound like problems that, theoretically, could be solved.</strong> Yes. It’s almost as if they are saying that the project will be heavily delayed and go vastly over budget.</p> <p><strong>That’s crazy talk! </strong>I know. Ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It’s a unique opportunity to spend the rest of your life with three people who hate humanity so much they want to live on Mars!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Still, with a bit of luck you might spend the rest of your life in the company of three corpses.”</p>","headline":"Will Mars One’s volunteers get to live on the red planet?

It was thought she’d chosen “Amal Alamuddin Clooney” as her married name, and perhaps she has, but it now seems that the “Alamuddin” is at least optional.</strong> A sad day.</p> <p><strong>Maybe if they have children Mrs Clooney wants them all to share a surname? </strong>Like that matters.</p> <p><strong>Maybe Mrs Clooney agrees with you politically but just has a soft spot for tradition?</strong> Stop calling her that! It’s like Beyoncé touring as Mrs Carter. Or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/14/cheryl-cole-married-french-boyfriend-jean-bernard-fernandez-versini\" title=\"\">Cheryl Fernandez-Versini</a>! You can’t say it without sounding sarcastic. She’ll always be Cheryl Cole to me.</p> <p><strong>You mean Cheryl Tweedy? </strong>Tweedy, yes. Sorry. Wor Cheryl Tweedy. That’s what she’ll always be.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Et tu Amal …?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “These foreigners! They come over here, marry our women, spreading their weird, foreign-sounding names … Wait a minute.”</p>","headline":"Amal Alamuddin or Mrs Amal Clooney?

Like Call of Duty: Black Ops II? </strong>Sort of.</p> <p><strong>Or is it more like a zombie survival thing? </strong>No, you’re getting colder.</p> <p><strong>What is it, then? </strong>It’s a multiplayer simulation of a transatlantic bank crisis.</p> <p><strong>That sounds insanely boring. Who would want to play a game like that? </strong>George Osborne, US treasury secretary Jack Lew, the head of the Federal Reserve, the governor of the Bank of England and several other economic authorities.</p> <p><strong>OK. Can I please not be on George’s team? </strong>You’re not invited, and there aren’t really teams. The idea is to simulate the collapse of a large financial institution and then execute the procedures in place to deal with the impending crisis, and see if they work or not.</p> <p><strong>And will they? </strong>We won’t know until the results are published, but Osborne thinks they’ve found a way to avoid a repeat of 2008, when the banks had to be bailed out by the taxpayer. “We are going to make sure we can handle an institution previously regarded as too big to fail,” he said.</p> <p><strong>Do financial war games serve any preventive purpose? </strong>A simulation run by the Bank of England in 2004 eerily presaged the failure of Northern Rock and its catastrophic knock-on effects.</p> <p><strong>So, no. </strong>Well, it would have, if recommended new measures had been put in place in time. But financial simulations are quite a common practice. Earlier this year the Bank of England launched a war game to test the banking system’s cyber-attack defences, called <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2014/030.aspx\" title=\"\">Waking Shark II</a>.</p> <p><strong>I would definitely play something called Waking Shark II. What’s the name of this new war game? </strong>It doesn’t appear to have one, sadly.</p> <p><strong>Where is this thing happening? Do they all dress up as wizards? </strong>At the offices of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in Washington. And maybe.</p> <p><strong>And why now? Should I be worried about impending global financial collapse? </strong>The situation is incredibly complicated, but basically: yes.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“I’ve managed the losses of creditors, and informed the relevant regulatory authorities. Your move.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Game over? What happened? Where did all the money go?”</p>","headline":"What kind of ‘war games’ is George Osborne playing in Washington?","trailText":"The UK chancellor is joining the US treasury’s Jack Lew and other finance bosses to take part in a simulated banking crisis, designed to test our preparedness for another crash.

Slowly dying.</p> <p><strong>Still, sad.</strong> You know what Balti is, don’t you?</p> <p><strong>I’d just assumed from the context that it was a brave circus elephant, or an inspiring rescue donkey.</strong> It’s a curry.</p> <p><strong>Oh THAT Balti. Haven’t had one in ages. What’s in it, again? </strong>It can contain any number of ingredients – but it’s normally rice with some kind of meat and vegetables, stewed until most of the liquid has evaporated.</p> <p><strong>And why is it dying?</strong> According to the food writer Madhur Jaffrey, the Balti was “just a craze” from the 80s and early 90s which has now waned in popularity.</p> <p><strong>Like </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T&apos;Pau_(band)\" title=\"\"><strong>T’pau</strong></a><strong>? </strong>No, not like T’pau. T’Pau have a very busy 2015 planned, I’ll have you know.</p> <p><strong>Where did Balti come from in the first place?</strong> Good question. According to some sources, the style of cooking originated in the Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan. Others say the name actually comes from the Urdu word for bucket, referring to the wok-like pot in which Baltis are commonly served.</p> <p><strong>What does Madhur Jaffrey say?</strong> She’s not buying either. “I don’t think it has its origins in any place we would want to visit,” she told the Cheltenham literature festival.</p> <p><strong>What did she mean by that?</strong> She meant Birmingham.</p> <p><strong>Slander!</strong> Not at all – she was merely stating her belief that it was not a traditional cuisine. “I think it just grew up in Birmingham, then Leeds, and then a lot of places round there,” she said.</p> <p><strong>Is there any truth to this? </strong>Possibly. Some claim the first Balti was served in 1977 in a restaurant in Birmingham, but nobody even really knows where the word comes from. The earliest citation is from a 1982 menu; the origins of the name remain obscure.</p> <p><strong>Like T’pau?</strong> No, not like T’pau. T’pau are named after a Star Trek character. Everybody knows that.</p> <p><strong>Has Jaffrey’s Balti death sentence been independently confirmed? </strong>Not really.

But not both. And definitely not anything else.</p> <p><strong>I’m confused. How … </strong>Let me stop you right there. The word “how” is a trademark of <a href=\"http://www.lrn.com/leadership\" title=\"\">Dov Seidman and LRN</a>, and any further infringements on this intellectual property will result in legal action.</p> <p><strong>But how … </strong>Again, we take the matter of trademark infringement very seriously, and we will not hesitate to hit you with the full arsenal of our legal firepower should you continue to disobey our polite cease-and-desist request.</p> <p><strong>Fine, let’s start at the beginning. What’s going on? </strong>Nothing short of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/business/chobani-and-dov-seidman-wrestle-over-use-of-how-trademark.html\" title=\"\">a full-pitched legal battle for ownership of the word “how”</a>, that’s what. Seidman is the founder of LRN, an ethical workplace consultancy firm, and he uses the word “how” a lot.</p> <p><strong>How much? </strong>It’s his entire corporate philosophy. He’s even written a book called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucQ7JNV-sM8\" title=\"\">How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything</a>. The title doesn’t even scan properly. That’s how much he loves the word “how”.</p> <p><strong>OK. Now, what’s all this about yoghurt? </strong>Well, the yoghurt manufacturer Chobani recently unveiled its new slogan, “How matters”. And because of that, Seidman is suing them.</p> <p><strong>Does that warrant a lawsuit? Isn’t “how” too common a word to trademark? </strong>It’s less about the word and more about the context. Seidman argues that “How matters” equates the word “how” with Chopani’s attitude towards ethics, which is something he claims to have invented. “They’ve appropriated the foundation of my entire philosophy,” is how he put it.</p> <p><strong>And have they?</strong> Well, that’s for the courts to decide. But for the time being, it’s probably best if nobody else uses the word “how”, just in case.</p> <p><strong>Can you suggest any alternatives? </strong>Instead of asking “How are you?” try saying: “I demand that you describe your current emotions and circumstances.” Or replacing “How does this work?” with “Thing explanation now please”. Seidman can’t touch you for that.</p> <p><strong>Do say</strong>: “Who”, “What”, “Where”, “When” or “Why”.</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Is a lawsuit over a word even that ethical, anyway?”</p>","headline":"How using the word ‘how’ could get you sued","trailText":"Corporate consultant Dov Seidman is suing the yoghurt manufacturer Chobani over its new slogan, ‘How matters’, which

Are they the ones with the lead singer who sounds like he’s trodden on a nail? </strong>You’re not really narrowing it down. Did you mean: “Are they the ones with the lead singer who sounds like he’s trodden on a nail, and who also did the music to that horrible sofa advert from a few years back?”</p> <p><strong>Sure. </strong>Then in that case, yes. You have correctly identified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/feb/09/howbadcannickelbackbe\" title=\"\">Nickelback</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wow, I really hate Nickelback. </strong>So do the people behind <a href=\"https://dontletnickelback.tilt.com/don-t-let-nickel-back\" title=\"\">Dontletnickelback</a>. It’s a new crowdfunding campaign designed exclusively to stop Nickelback from ever performing in the UK again.</p> <p><strong>Fantastic! What are the rewards I can expect for donating? </strong>It depends – $1 will pay for an email written on your behalf to Nickelback’s management, urging them never to play another concert in the UK. Stump up $10 and they’ll send an email “full of explicit phrases and lots of capital letters and maybe even a rude emoticon or two”. There’s something for everyone.</p> <p><strong>Anything else? </strong>Pledge $50 and they’ll send some of Nickelback’s music to Nickelback, so that Nickelback can listen to themselves, realise how inept they are and immediately retire.</p> <p><strong>Be honest, though: is this likely to work? </strong>Probably not. Four years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/07/weezer-offered-10m-split-up\" title=\"\">fans tried raising $10m to convince Weezer to retire</a>, thereby halting the steady drip of reputation-eroding albums that the band insisted on releasing in quick succession. In retaliation, Weezer have just released their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/02/weezer-everything-will-be-alright-in-the-end-review\" title=\"\">best-reviewed album in about a decade</a>.</p> <p><strong>So this campaign might actually spur Nickelback on to create some of the best music of their career? </strong>Don’t be silly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/24/nickelback-popularity-contest-pickle\" title=\"\">it’s still Nickelback</a>. It’ll still sound like a bad Nirvana cover band fronted by a man who won’t stop treading on nails.</p> <p><strong>But aren’t Nickelback actually, you know, quite popular? </strong>Admittedly, yes. Every album they have released this millennium has made the UK album chart Top 10. Even their last, relatively unpopular, album went gold here.</p> <p><strong>So aren’t Nickelback fans a little bit annoyed about this crowdfunding campaign?</strong> Again, don’t be silly. Nickelback fans can’t read.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Don’t let Nickel back.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Why do I suddenly want to purchase a sofa?”</p>","headline":"Would you pay $1 to stop Nickelback playing in the UK?

Has it had its hair done? </strong>No, not that, you idiot. Between you and me I think it might look a little more, well ... planet-y than usual.</p> <p><strong>Surely that can’t be the case. We’ve been through this before, remember? </strong>I know, I know. Pluto had been a planet since its discovery in 1930, only to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/25/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration\" title=\"\">unceremoniously relegated to dwarf planet status by the International Astronomical Union in 2006</a>. And yet ...</p> <p><strong>And yet what? </strong>And yet the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysicists is lobbying hard for Pluto to become a planet again.</p> <p><strong>Why? We’ve just had all the textbooks reprinted.</strong> It’s all about the definition. According to the Harvard-Smithsonian news blog, even if Pluto is a dwarf planet, we should still treat it as a planet because: <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2014-25\" title=\"\">“A dwarf fruit tree is still a small fruit tree, and a dwarf hamster is still a small hamster.”</a> The centre had a debate, and then there was a vote, and the result was overwhelmingly in favour of Pluto’s reinstatement as a planet.</p> <p><strong>What happens if we do let Pluto back in? </strong>Well, there’s a chance that other distant trans-Neptunian objects – such as Triton or Eris or 50000 Quaoar or 90377 Sedna – could also qualify for official planetary status.</p> <p><strong>But this is madness! The floodgates will open! We’ll never be able to turn back the tide of shifty-looking would-be planets looking to get an unjustified cut of our solar system! </strong>All right, Farage, rein it in.</p> <p><strong>Fine. But does any of this actually matter? </strong>If you’re a member of the International Astronomical Union or the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysicists – basically the Sharks and the Jets of the planetary-definition game – then yes.</p> <p><strong>And what does Pluto make of all this? </strong>Pluto is a massive clump of rock and ice trapped in a lonely silent orbit through the dark recesses of space several billion miles away from Earth. As such, it could not be reached for comment.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Welcome back to the solar system, Pluto. We’ve missed you.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Now get out.

It's also a portmanteau of Merkel and Hollande, the old German chancellor and the new French president.</p><p><strong>So it's the new Merkozy? </strong>Exactly. But much less cosy than the old one.</p><p><strong>Because? </strong>Because unlike Mer and Kozy, Mer and&nbsp;De grew up on very different sides of the political tracks. She's an austerity-loving conservative and he's a stimulus-seeking socialist&nbsp;elected on the back of a pledge to renegotiate the eurozone's fiscal pact.</p><p><strong>Is that a problem? </strong>It is.</p><p><strong>Why so? </strong>Because Merkel insists that the fiscal pact is simply \"not up for debate\". She claims if they open up negotiations on the agreement, Greece will demand to renegotiate the troika package, other countries will follow suit and then everything that's ever been agreed in Europe since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia will have to be thrown out and rewritten from scratch. At which point every town, village and remote clifftop lighthouse in Europe will be simultaneously rendered worthless, ransacked by&nbsp;looters and set on fire.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a pretty intractable position she's got there. </strong>Nah, it's more flexible than it looks.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Yup. Hollande's off to see Merkel tomorrow afternoon as soon as he's been sworn in and experts reckon the pair should agree a compromise in no time.</p><p><strong>How exactly? </strong>By putting the fiscal pact to one side and putting together a \"growth pact\" to run alongside it, thus allowing both to walk away from discussions with their heads held high. The key question is whether the growth pact will be – as many supporters of Hollande are hoping – built around a fiscal stimulus funded by&nbsp;further borrowing, or – as Merkel's government is insisting it will have to be – a series of measures to&nbsp;improve European competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Hold on. Isn't \"measures to improve European competitiveness\" just another term for austerity? </strong>Pretty much, yep. That'd be why the French are saying \"Merde!\".</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"Merkel + Hollande = Merde ...\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"... so does Monti + Cameron =
