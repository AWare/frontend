So much has happened since that Im unsure as to what to share. I could tell you that going into labour after a 5km walk under the sun is a bad idea; that the drive to the hospital is never as straightforward as you planned; that going up and down stairs is the best way to launch full blown contractions; that going from 1.5cm to 10cm can happen a hell of a lot faster than you would ever imagine; that it is possible to deliver a child old-school, without an epidural; that just when you think it’s over, an ill-placed umbilical cord can make you age a decade in ten minutes; that even if they are covered in blood, cream cheese and black crap, you still want to kiss them and hug them and kiss them some more; that everyone tells you to sleep when they do, but no one tells you when to sleep if they don’t; that breastfeeding is part mechanics part perseverance and part magic; that meeting other father&amp;sons along the corridors of a hospital is the best icebreaker I have ever known; that my missus is now, without a doubt, the single bravest, strongest, most bad-ass woman I have ever met. And yet, all of that would be circumstantial – the truth is that right now Im shell-shocked and tired and excited and scared and jubilant and in general awe that I could have anything to do with something so amazing. I have no idea if I&#x27;m going to be a good father, but I know Im going to be one very happy one. And surely that’s a start</p>\n    </div>\n  \n  \n  </figcaption>\n  \n</div>\n<footer class=\"element-witness--footer\">\n  <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a
