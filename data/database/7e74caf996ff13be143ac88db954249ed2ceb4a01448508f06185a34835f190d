He said the whole life sentence was unduly harsh, comparing it to that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/ukranian-white-supremacist-murder-mosque-bombs-pavlo-lapshyn\" title=\"\">Pavlo Lapshyn, a white supremacist terrorist who was jailed for 40 years for killing a Muslim man</a> and planning to bomb three mosques.</p><p>\"It seems strange to me that a man can be sentenced to life for the death of one man and another man can be sentenced to 40 years for the death of one man and the attempted murder of many others,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007v5cz\" title=\"\">BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire</a> on Wednesday morning. \"I wonder what the difference is here … It seems strange that [the judge] can suggest there is no prospect of rehabilitation for my brother and there is a prospect of rehabilitation for [Pavlo Lapshyn] who openly stated he wished to create a race war.\"</p><p>During sentencing the judge highlighted the treatment of the Rigby's body, the lack of remorse shown by the defendants and the fact that Rigby had been carrying out a public service when he handed down the whole life tariff.</p><p>But asked if he believed there had been an element of Islamophobia in the sentencing decision, Jeremiah, said: \"Not only that but I think it was trial by the public. There was a lot of public outrage as could be understood… with the death of a soldier. I would suggest that [the judge] was simply giving in to that pressure. We all know …that my brother was the focus. I believe [the judge] was simply giving the public what they wanted.\"</p><p>Adebowale and Adebolajo hacked at Rigby's body with a variety of knives and a cleaver as they attempted to behead him on a busy street in Woolwich. Adebolajo had claimed his act of butchery was a military strike commanded by God and that he was a soldier of Allah.</p><p>At their sentencing in February, where Adebowale was ordered to serve a minimum of 45 years in jail, the pair fought with guards before being dragged from the court.</p><p>Jeremiah said on Wednesday that he was surprised when he first found out what his brother had done but refused to expand further. He said he believed there was a link between the attack in Woolwich and UK foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he said he believed his brother would not pose a danger to society if he was rehabilitated.</p><p>\"Were he to be rehabilitated I think he would lead a productive life – I think it's important not to forget that he has young children himself.\"</p>","headline":"Lee Rigby killer's brother says Adebolajo sympathises with family","trailText":"Jeremiah Adebolajo, brother of Lee Rigby killer Michael, tells BBC Radio 5 Live that life sentence was unduly harsh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395836166044/Lee-Rigby-murder-006.jpg","wordcount":"546","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T12:18:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/26/lee-rigby-killer-brother-adebolajo-sympathy-family","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/26/lee-rigby-killer-brother-adebolajo-sympathy-family","tags":[{"id":"uk/woolwich-attack","webTitle":"Woolwich attack","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/woolwich-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/woolwich-attack","references":[]},{"id":"uk/ukcrime","webTitle":"Crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"profile/matthewtaylor","webTitle":"Matthew Taylor","rcsId":"GNL038134","r2ContributorId":"16105","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Matthew Taylor is a reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewtaylor","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/matthewtaylor","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433031392","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395836157240/Lee-Rigby-murder-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Metropolitan Police","altText":"Lee Rigby murder","height":"54","credit":"Metropolitan Police/PA","caption":"Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Anyone with assets of more than £23,250 is expected to pay his or her own care home fees.</p><p>In a detailed statement responding to the newspaper's allegations, Bone said his home in Northamptonshire had been raided by police in March 2013, and that the following month he and his wife were questioned about a complaint raised by the county council.</p><p>He said that his wife had been in dispute with the council since 2009 about the funding of her mother's care needs and that in January 2013 a writ was issued claiming that she owed it money.</p><p>On Tuesday Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of the CPS special crime division, said: \"The CPS received a file of evidence from Northamptonshire police in relation to a 54-year-old woman and her 61-year-old husband on 13 November 2013.</p><p>\"Having carefully considered all of the available evidence, in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors, we have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any criminal offence.</p><p>\"We were asked to consider whether there was a case for fraud by abuse of position and theft by disposal of assets belonging to the woman's mother. We were also asked to consider whether there was a case of fraud by false representation to Northamptonshire council in relation to the mother's assets.</p><p>\"The evidence showed: firstly, that the woman's mother considered the suspects' conduct to be acceptable; secondly, that the suspects acted openly in declaring the sale of the mother's house to the council; thirdly, that no element of dishonesty could be proved. Therefore we have advised the police to take no further action.</p><p>\"We understand there is ongoing civil litigation. For the avoidance of doubt our advice to police relates solely to possible criminal action.\"</p><p>In a statement,  Bone said: \"First, Jennie and I have been humbled by the huge number of phone calls, texts, emails and cards we have received supporting us.</p><p>\"We are so very appreciative to everyone who has contacted us. It is amazing that we have had so many members of the public, who have taken the time to get in touch, or cross the road to shake my hand; they have not always been of our political persuasion, but they have all expressed their warmest appreciation of what Jennie and I do for the constituency.</p><p>\"It has also been interesting to hear of so many people who find themselves in a similar position to us.</p><p>\"What has been so frustrating about this whole episode is that it has been going on for over a year, without an opportunity for us to clear our names. Recently, we have suffered trial by media. One newspaper in particular has printed information that is incorrect and made allegations that are totally untrue. It seems that certain newspapers feel able to print information that is without foundation, despite being told in advance that that information is factually incorrect.</p><p>\"Jennie and I have just heard that we are not going to be charged with any criminal offence. This is obviously very good news and a vindication of our stance all along.

Today we have Laidler to thank for more than just a fine-looking landmark – we have an institution that's entertained generations of grateful Bradfordians and given us something to chirp about in a city that suffers from civic pride deficiency.</p><p>Despite its Edwardian splendour, the Alhambra was always conceived as a cultural playground for the decent, working people of an industrial town (without a bingo ball in sight). Indeed something of a novelty in 1914 was the fact that the \"cheap seats\" were upholstered in the same way as the dress circle, meaning the masses no longer had to settle for stiff wooden benches whilst enjoying their entertainment. </p><p>A century on, and the venue continues to be a social leveller in a city of countless backgrounds. To observe the Italian-marbled foyer before any performance of the Alhambra’s annual pantomime extravaganza (a tradition started by ‘King of Panto’ Laidler himself in the ‘30s) is to see all of Bradford… wealthy ladies from Ilkley… youth groups from Holme wood… Pakistani families from Girlington… a hardworking city coming together in the way Laidler could only have dreamed of when the theatre’s foundations were laid in 1912. </p><p>But her most importantly of all, the Alhambra is something of a rarity in 21st century Bradford – it’s an attraction. And a very successful one at that. The framed playbills adorning the walls under the Alhambra’s domes are testament to the theatre’s importance in Britain’s golden age of variety. Laurel &amp; Hardy, George Formby, Morecambe &amp; Wise - they all considered Bradford an important pin on the map. Today, bums are on seats to see prestigious West End productions, National Theatre plays or the latest Matthew Bourne masterpiece come to town. Sadler’s Wells is little more than a secondary school auditorium once you’ve seen Swan Lake performed under the Alhambra’s ornate plasterwork. </p><p>As the curtain goes up on the Alhambra’s latest coup – the world-renowned production of The Lion King – a new generation of Bradfordians will be mesmerised by what’s happening in their own town, and will hopefully grow to realise what a truly special place it is. Sharing a frontage with the National Media Museum and a potential new music venue in the old Art Deco Odeon building next door, let’s hope the theatre’s continued success acts a catalyst for a resurgence of the arts in a city that desperately needs it. </p><p>Happy Birthday, our Alhambra. You’re Bradford’s past, present, and<i> </i>future.</p><p><b>Follow Si Cunningham on Twitter: @sicunninghamz</b>  </p>","headline":"Happy 100th birthday to Bradford's Alhambra","trailText":"Conceived

practice of seeking royal consent for parliamentary bills may soon come to an end","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>A cross-party committee of MPs has questioned whether the Queen and the Prince of Wales should keep a residual power of veto over certain parliamentary bills.</p><p>MPs on the Commons political and constitutional reform committee said the royal process of consent fuels speculation that the monarch \"has undue influence on the legislative process\".</p><p>Under a convention dating back to 1728, the monarch must consent to any parliamentary bill affecting the crown. The Prince of Wales does the same for bills affecting the Duchy of Cornwall.</p><p>The MPs highlighted the way in which the Queen's solicitors, Farrer &amp; Co, have to be copied in to all correspondence seeking consent. They said: \"The process of consent is complex and arcane and its existence, and the way in which the process operates, undoubtedly does fuel speculation that the monarchy has an undue influence on the legislative process.\"</p><p>But the members were unable to cite examples where the Queen or Prince Charles withheld consent. Andrew Lansley, leader of the Commons, said a request for consent was effectively a demand by ministers for agreement from the monarch or her heir. \"A request for consent carries with it by implication ministerial advice that consent should be granted,\" Lansley said in written evidence.</p><p>The MPs on the committee said it is the government, rather than the monarch, which can use the process of consent to block a bill. Prof Rodney Brazier of Manchester University told MPs he could think of four examples between 1868 and 1999 when the government used the process to block a private member's bill.</p><p>In the most recent example, the then Labour MP Tam Dalyell said Tony Blair's government had advised that royal consent should be refused in 1999 over his bill to ensure military action could only be taken in Iraq with parliament's approval. The then government is likely to have argued that Dalyell's bill would have curbed the royal prerogative – the monarch's power, exercised by the PM, to declare war.</p><p>MPs are usually informed at the third reading stage whether consent has been granted. This is separate to the royal assent, which turns a bill into law after it has passed all its parliamentary stages.</p><p>The committee indicated that the time might be approaching when the practice should end. This could be decided by parliament and would not need a law change.</p><p>The MPs said: \"The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy. The Queen has the right to be consulted, to advise and to warn. But beyond that she should have no role in the legislative process. Consent serves to remind us that parliament has three elements – the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Queen-in-parliament. Its existence could be regarded as a matter of courtesy between the three parts of Parliament. Whether this is a compelling justification for its continuance is a matter of opinion.\"</p>","headline":"MPs question royal family's 'undue influence' on legislation","trailText":"Committee of MPs

after no action is taken following complaint by mother of Stephen Lawrence","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Britain's biggest police force has been accused of failing to investigate death threats that have been made against Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence.</p><p>The charge was levelled against Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, by Keith Vaz, the chair of the home affairs select committee, on Tuesday. It came as Vaz said Hogan-Howe had a reputation for promising to root out corruption and racism within the police force, but \"at the end of the day\" had failed to deliver.</p><p>Vaz also revealed that his committee is to launch an investigation into the culture and governance of the Met, following a series of scandals that have engulfed the country's largest police force.</p><p>Hogan-Howe had been called before the committee to explain why his force had shredded a large number of internal files relating to alleged corruption in the Met's botched investigation into the murder of Lawrence.</p><p>Vaz told Hogan-Howe: \"I spoke to Baroness Lawrence. She said she had a meeting with you in which it was put to her that you had evidence of people making death threats against her. This was done in the presence of a solicitor, yet nothing has happened as far as she can see with regards to anyone coming back to her to tell us about this very serious issue.\"</p><p>With going into further detail, Vaz added that \"promises were made\" about \"very serious matters\". Hogan-Howe said he would look into it \"immediately\".</p><p>In often testy exchanges, Vaz told the Met commissioner that he did not seem to have a proper grip of the controversy surrounding  the Lawrence investigation. Hogan-Howe had said that he had experienced one of the worst days in his police career when a report by QC Mark Ellison revealed earlier this month that the Met had spied on the Lawrence family. Its findings led home secretary Theresa May to order a public inquiry into the undercover policing of political groups.</p><p>Vaz announced the committee's inquiry into the Met despite Hogan-Howe dismissing the need for an inquiry as \"absolute nonsense\".</p><p>Scotland Yard said that at a private meeting with the commissioner on 13 March, Baroness Lawrence had mentioned threats made to the Stephen Lawrence Trust Twitter account, and that an officer was investigating. The force said: \"As stated by Keith Vaz at the home affairs select committee, we can confirm that Baroness Lawrence raised an issue regarding social media at a private meeting between her, the commissioner and the deputy commissioner on Thursday 13 March.</p><p>\"Her legal team were contacted shortly after the meeting in relation to the inquiry and permission sought to access the Stephen Lawrence Foundation Twitter account, as this was the account receiving the threat.</p><p>\"A few days later an officer from the MPS contacted Baroness Lawrence directly and on 21 March an officer contacted the Stephen Lawrence Foundation via email seeking further information.

But the family's celebrations were short-lived, as later the same day it was announced that the whole family was to be sent back to Mauritius.</p><p>Solicitors working on Yashika's case were told that it had been rejoined with that of the rest of her family, and that the appeal against their deportation had been rejected. On Tuesday evening, the news was broken to teachers and friends of two of the family's three children at the Oasis Academy Hadley, in north London, who have led a campaign to block the deportation supported by more than 100,000 people.</p><p>Headteacher Lynne Dawes said she thought the move was an attempt to dismiss their argument that deporting Yashika would split up her family. \"I'm not proud of my country treating people in this way,\" she said. \"Her mother is not coping, she's really struggling and is very tearful.\"</p><p>The family, including Yashika's mother Sowbhagyawatee, 38, sister Shaivya, 16  and brother Cherish, 11, will now be deported.</p><p>Lee Pedder, 18, a friend of Yashika, said: \"Our legal team are pushing them and we will continue to as well. If her entire family is going to be deported, we will support them all. This is a massively cynical tactic to try and shut up democratic oversight.\"</p><p>Estyhia Tangeli, 18, said the decision to deport both girls from the school, and the rest of the family, was disgraceful. She said: \"It makes them look worse as they will lose two valuable members of society; her sister is predicted As and A*s in her GCSEs she's about to sit.\"</p><p>Another friend, Shantelle Creed, 17, said: \"We're showing just how passionate and engaged we are and they're backing us into a corner. We won't stop.\"</p><p>Yashika's case also attracted support in Westminster. Conservative MP David Burrowes made a plea to the Home Office on her behalf. He said that British Airways had refused to deport the teenager on Tuesday afternoon, leading to her being sent back to Yarl's Wood detention centre, in Bedfordshire.</p><p>The family came to the UK in 2012, fleeing violent threats from a family member.</p><p>The shadow immigration minister, David Hanson MP, called at the weekend for the family's case to be reconsidered. A student at Yashika's school said that he phoned the office of Hanson's opposite number, the Conservative immigration minister James Brokenshire, and was told they were \"supportive\" of the campaign to keep Yashika in the country.</p><p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it and we consider every application on its individual merits. We do not routinely comment on individual cases.\"</p><p>British Airways refused to comment, citing data protection laws. James Brokenshire MP did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>","headline":"Mauritius teenager to be deported with family","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive:</strong> Yashika Bageerathi, 19, first led to believe she has been reprieved – then told her entire family will be deported","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395778496670/Yashika-Bageerathi-006.jpg","wordcount":"549","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T20:23:57Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/25/yashika-bageerathi-family-deported-mauritius","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/25/yashika-bageerathi-family-deported-mauritius","tags":[{"id":"uk/immigration","webTitle":"Immigration and asylum","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/immigration","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"world/mauritius","webTitle":"Mauritius","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mauritius","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/mauritius","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/natasha-clark","webTitle":"Natasha Clark","r2ContributorId":"51967","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Clearing_Pix/furniture/2012/7/20/1342774020626/Natasha-Clark-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Natasha Clark is a freelance journalist, currently studying an MA in newspaper journalism at City University.

More are due to arrive next month.</p><p>Following pressure from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and some Tory backbenchers, the government dropped its previous opposition to admitting refugees directly from the region, and eight weeks ago announced the new scheme in conjunction with UNHCR.</p><p>Syrian refugees admitted under the scheme will have all rights and benefits that go with \"humanitarian protection\" status, including access to public funds, access to the labour market and the possibility of family reunion.

Some of the entries were written in his own blood after he had self-harmed.</p><p>The coroner, Emma Carlyon, has ordered that the celebrity at the centre of the allegations be referred to as Mr X during the inquest at Truro in Cornwall.</p><p>On Tuesday Detective Constable Joanna Sodergren described how the teenager was found walking in the middle of a busy road near his home in Cornwall a month before his death. He told officers it was at least his 43rd attempt to take his own life.</p><p>Sodergren told the inquest: \"He spoke about being hurt by a couple of men in London which had lasted five months until he left. He was disgusted and he wanted to push it out of his mind.\"</p><p>Cowburn said he was not able to end his life because \"he wouldn't let me\". When asked who the \"he\" was, the teenager said he did not want to say as he was on television and in magazines.</p><p>The inquest has already been told that Cowburn, a fashion college graduate, met the celebrity in a pub and began working as his stylist.</p><p>Sodergren added: \"He said the man had brought him nice things and took him to nice places but had done sexual things to him. Asked if he had been raped or sexually assaulted he said he had not but agreed to them as he felt pressured to do the things. He said if he killed himself it would make it better as it would make it go away.\"</p><p>The detective said when was being driven away from the road where he was found officers heard Cowburn rapping and mentioning the celebrity's name.</p><p>After Cowburn was found dead at Longreach House mental health unit near Redruth in Cornwall in December 2010, local police informed Scotland Yard about his allegations. The star has not been arrested or questioned over Cowburn's allegations and has not been called to give evidence to the inquest.</p><p>Carlyon asked Sodergren if she was satisfied with the way the Met had dealt with the investigation. The coroner asked: \"Are you satisfied Ben was not subjected to criminal, forced or persuaded sexual activity?\"</p><p>Sodergren replied: \"I cannot comment on the Met's investigation.

She said she would have placed five of these into each small archive box.</p><p>Her Sun beauty column was weekly and lasted for six years, the jury heard.</p><p>The jury heard that Carter wanted to keep her historic cuttings because they were of value to her for work and although she had 15 cupboards in the Sun editor's office, the space in Brooks's new office was going to be severely restricted because \"they'd chopped Mr Rupert Murdoch's office in half and given us a small tiny space\".</p><p>The jury heard how Carter had developed her own cosmetics range and had asked management if she could open a beauty salon at News International. She had been given the go-ahead and bought equipment but this was put on hold because of budget cuts.</p><p>Carter told jurors that all seven boxes were filled with her beauty scrapbooks apart from two notebooks belonging to Brooks. One was an A5 notebook Brooks had given her in 1995 when she first started working for her as a temp at the News of the World and the other was a telephone record book with the year 2007 written on the front .</p><p>Asked by her defence counsel if Brooks played any part in the archiving of these notebooks, Carter replied: \"No\". Asked by Trevor Burke, QC, if Brooks was aware that Carter had gone into the office on the Sunday to pack up the office, she replied: \"No\". Did she ever discuss the boxes with Brooks? \"No, she would have thought I was mad.\"</p><p>The prosecution case, outlined in January, is that Carter requested the removal of the boxes on 8 July, two days before the News of the World closed, took the boxes home to conceal them for the police who were at the time investigating News of the World.</p><p>The boxes were labelled as \"Notebooks 1995 to 2007\" with a second line stating they were \"All notebooks from Rebekah Brooks, nee (Wade)\".</p><p>Carter said she accepted that she was responsible for the first part of the label but not the second. \"I would never have described her as such [nee Wade].</p><p>\"I would have put a Post It note on the top [of the boxes] just describing it,\" said Carter.</p><p>Asked why she wasn't more explicit and stated that they were her notebooks, Carter said she didn't think she was entitled to archive anything as a secretary.</p><p>Carter described herself as the \"eyes and ears\" of the newsroom in the News of the World and the Sun, both of which Brooks was editing before rising to the top position in the newspaper company.</p><p>Giving evidence for the first day in the witness box Carter said she had never taken notes for Brooks at meetings or attended any of the newspaper conferences, the daily meetings where the news agenda of the day is discussed with senior staff.</p><p>Although she studied shorthand, she had never used it in her 17 years working for Brooks.</p><p>The jury heard she was also a friend of Ross Kemp, who she knew in sixth form at school, but had nothing to do with his later introduction to Brooks.</p><p>She joined Brooks as a temp in 1995 and became her full-time secretary in 1996. Carter told jurors she never saw Brooks act as a \"working journalist\" and that she was always in a \"managerial role\".</p><p>Asked what Brooks's management style was, Carter responded: \"Fast, everything had to be done immediately.\" Her job, she told the jury, was to \"make sure the office ran as smoothly as possible\" and that Brooks's private life was also run as smoothly as possible.</p><p>Carter has been charged with one count of conspiring to conceal potential evidence from police by removing permanently seven boxes of notebooks and other material from the archive of News International between 6 July 2011 and 9 July 2011.</p><p>The jury heard on Tuesday that the boxes contained scrapbooks of cuttings of Carter's beauty column in the Sun even though they were labelled as Brooks's notebooks.</p><p>Carter said the normal pad Brooks used both as deputy editor of the Sun and editor of the News of the World was an A3 desk pad. She would take the top sheet off and place it underneath and a backlog of these loose sheets would be removed and temporarily stored every three weeks.</p><p>She was in the witness box for the first time on Tuesday after being invited to start her defence following the absence of Clive Goodman, the former royal editor of the News of the World who was midway through cross examination before he was taken ill.</p><p>The jury heard that Goodman's evidence would be parked until a later date.</p>","headline":"Phone-hacking trial: Brooks 'had nothing to do' with archiving notepads","trailText":"<p>Ex-secretary of former Sun editor tells jury notebooks in allegedly concealed boxes mainly contained beauty scrapbooks.

The confusion for some of her classmates has obviously arisen from the fact that although she looks like them, her penchant for Christmas carols and enthusiastic handing out of Christmas presents mean that in some ways she doesn’t behave like them. The obvious explanation that has occurred to these children is that either she is not a Muslim full stop, or that she must have one parent who is Christian - hence the enthusiasm for Christmas. This is a playground version of the same dynamic being played out on the Fox News interview; the failure to understand why someone who identifies themselves as being a Muslim would want to have anything to do with Jesus.</p><p>This view that Jesus is alien to Islam, and not a figure of interest to Muslims, is one that I have come across time and again both among Muslims and Christians. When I spoke to my daughter’s teacher about what could become bullying behaviour, I suggested the need for a discussion in class about the centrality of Jesus and Mary in Islam. She really didn't seem to grasp where I was coming from.  <br></p><p>My respect for Jesus, which I have tried to instil in my daughter, stems from the fact that as a Muslim I was brought up with the figures of Jesus and Mary. Mary, or Maryam in Arabic, is particularly revered and held up as a symbol of piety and chastity for women. There are any number of girls, my daughter’s classmates among them, named after her in the Muslim world. As a Muslim growing up in the UK, attending a Catholic junior school, I interacted with Mary and Jesus on a daily basis. The Lord’s prayer, Hail Mary and the Apostles' Creed, which I recited every morning during assembly, were as familiar to me as the Ayat-ul-Kursi (the Verse of the Throne), Surah Al-Fateha and the four Quls that I recited before going to sleep every night. Therefore, the need to understand how the Christian belief sat alongside my own was an urgent one. To come across Zealot, a book on the life of Jesus written by a man not only with scholarly credentials but who had for a period of time converted to Christianity before reverting back to Islam, was fascinating.</p><p>However, while I found Zealot a riveting read it did make me wince on occasion. There is always a certain tension when a religious figure is viewed from a historical, rather than a faith, perspective. It is not possible to get away from the fact that all religions contain certain beliefs that require a leap of faith, so to speak. In Islam these include the Meraj or Night Journey where the Prophet Muhammed travelled from Mecca, to Jerusalem, to heaven and back in a single night. In Christianity there are the beliefs of the Immaculate Conception and the resurrection. It is precisely the tension between these leaps of faith and the historical corroboration, or lack of, that makes Zealot an interesting yet at times uncomfortable read.</p><p><b>• Reza Aslan will be

There will be two flows. First, as Boris approvingly suggests, retiring baby boomers will lend their children money to put together a deposit for a house. Second, as he skips over, they will use the money as a deposit of their own to buy flats or houses to be rented out...</p><p>The trouble is, the consequences will not be as benign as the Mayor seems to think. Because housing isn't quite like other goods. Look at it like this: if lots more people put down deposits on new cars, car manufacturers will simply expand supply. Since car-making is highly competitive, and the supply of raw materials fairly easily increased, all that extra demand will not have much effect on the price. </p><p>With housing, by contrast, the supply is almost wholly unresponsive to price. If you increase the number of people who can afford to buy homes at current prices, then the main effect will be to raise prices high again to make housing about as unaffordable as it was before.</p></blockquote><p>So much, yet again, for Mayor Johnson's big bubble of total faith in the self-correcting urge of market forces - especially where housing is concerned. And yet, as the Economist says, his hunch about baby-boomers may well be right. Property prices in London are now so utterly extreme that even people like me - good job, a bit put by, long-term owner-occupier - shudder at the price tags on local two-bedroom flats, and this in a neighbourhood which, though suddenly <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/claptonian/gentrification/\">gentrifying at spectacular speed</a>, is still very far from being the capital's priciest. </p><p>What hope do the children of even London parents in my sort of position have of avoiding the capital's (also too expensive) private rented sector and buying somewhere vaguely near where they grew up, let alone all those who are much worse off? Unless they strike it very rich, the hopes of many of them are already pretty small - and may well indeed end up depending on mum and dad tipping out their pension pots. So, well spotted, Mr Mayor. But how grateful for this whole, desperate state of affairs do you expect us be?</p>","headline":"London housing crisis: Boris's bubble of belief","trailText":"<p>The London mayor has applauded the budget's pension reforms for creating new property investment opportunities, but not everybody shares his glee</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nzd7","wordcount":"590","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-01T11:22:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/mar/25/boris-johnson-budget-pension-property-london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/mar/25/boris-johnson-budget-pension-property-london","tags":[{"id":"uk/davehillblog","webTitle":"Dave Hill's London blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/davehillblog","references":[]},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/boris","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davehill","webTitle":"Dave Hill","rcsId":"GNL064289","r2ContributorId":"21999","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/29/Dave_Hill.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dave Hill is a novelist, blogger, occasional broadcaster and long-standing writer for the Guardian.

Conservatives for Managed Migration amid fears cap is impractical and risks damaging economic growth","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Britain's future as a trading nation is being threatened by the Tory cap on immigration, a leading Conservative backbencher has warned as he called on David Cameron to stop trying to \"out-Ukip Ukip\".</p><p>Mark Field, the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster who was speaking ahead of the launch of a new moderate group on immigration, said the cap was impractical and would not be met in this parliament.</p><p>Field is launching the  Conservatives for Managed Migration group amid fears among moderate Tories and business leaders that Cameron risks damaging economic growth with his pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.</p><p>The government has all but admitted that it will fail to meet the target by the next election after official figures released at the time of last week's budget showed the Treasury expects net migration to run at 150,000 next year.</p><p>The prime minister is still officially committed to the target to cut net migration to  tens of thousands even after figures released last month by the Office for National Statistics showed a net flow of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/27/net-migration-uk-jumps-30-percent\" title=\"\"> 212,000 migrants to Britain</a> in the 12 months to the end of September. This compared with 154,000 in the previous year.</p><p>Business leaders are concerned that the government, which is powerless to stop migration from the EU, is preventing talented migrants from entering Britain from outside the EU. Field said  Britain was in danger of losing future \"ambassadors for the UK\" from India, China and South Korea.</p><p>The backbencher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"There is a fundamental problem with having what we now have which is this net migration policy which targets headline numbers alone. Very few voters out there believe we can deliver on it. All the evidence suggests it is now moving in the wrong direction. Very few businesses believe it is practical. It risks sending out the wrong signals about our openness and Britain's traditional openness as a trading nation to the world at large.</p><p>\"One of the problems is that we have been victims of our own success. One of the reasons why we are not able to achieve the net migration figure is that our economy is so over performing and outperforming our neighbours that many people are coming from Spain and Portugal and France – [they] want to come to these shores, fewer people want to leave and therefore net migration is going up and up.\"</p><p>Field called for a calm debate and for the Tories to distance themselves from the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, who has called for immigration controls even if they damaged economic growth.</p><p>He said: \"We need a more calm debate about this.

About 300 new or expanded jobs will be created, taking the net number of leavers to 1,300 out of a workforce of 150,000.</p><p>The Unite union condemned the treatment of employees, who it said deserved better. The union, which represents 7,000 Royal Mail managers, said if management made forced redundancies it would consider balloting for strikes.</p><p>Brian Scott, Unite's officer for Royal Mail, said: \"First the government sells off Royal Mail on the cheap and now the newly privatised service is ruthlessly sacrificing jobs.</p><p>\"We do not believe that it's a coincidence that this announcement has been made just before the company prepares to announce its first full set of accounts since privatisation. It's more proof that Royal Mail's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation.\"</p><p>Royal Mail shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index, dropping 1.5% to 575p. The formerly state-owned postal service <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/royal-mail-share-investors-300-profit\" title=\"\">floated on the stock market in October</a> in what critics said was an underpriced sale that benefited City investors. The company said at the time that it would have to become more efficient to compete with private operators.</p><p>The company announced its first job cuts since privatisation days before its financial year-end on 30 March. Royal Mail posts its first set of annual results to the City in May.</p><p>Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said the cuts were drastic and deeply concerning. The CWU mainly represents frontline postal workers but it said it would fight to protect jobs.</p><p>The union's top Royal Mail representatives will discuss the cuts at a scheduled meeting on Tuesday and may make a further announcement then.</p><p>The company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/09/royal-mail-workers-pay-increase\" title=\"\">hammered out a landmark deal with the CWU</a> late last year that enshrined workers' rights and appeared to usher in an era of post-privatisation industrial peace. Royal Mail said it would consult with both unions about the cuts.</p><p>Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: \"We are continuously improving our efficiency, whilst maintaining our high quality of service. We need to do so in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets. This is the best way to ensure the continued delivery of the universal service and the good quality jobs we provide for our people.\"</p><p>The company said the job cuts would cost it about £100m and that total \"transformation costs\" for the financial year ending 30 March would be £230m – £70m higher than it had predicted.</p><p>About £25m of the cost savings will take effect next year, partly making up for a likely increase of between £70m and £80m in the cost of pensions. Royal Mail said the job cuts were not a response to the rising pension costs.</p><p>Royal Mail said about 50,000 employees had left since 2003 and that it had a good record of cutting jobs by not replacing leavers, finding people new jobs and voluntary redundancy.</p>","headline":"Royal Mail faces strikes over plan to shed 1,600 staff","trailText":"<p>Unions threaten ballot for industrial action after bosses said plan that includes forced redundancies would save company £50m</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390556143874/Royal-Mail-006.jpg","wordcount":"535","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T08:24:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/25/royal-mail-shed-1600-jobs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/25/royal-mail-shed-1600-jobs","tags":[{"id":"uk/royal-mail","webTitle":"Royal Mail","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-mail","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/royal-mail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/post","webTitle":"Postal service","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/post","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/post","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/financial3","webTitle":"Financial","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432992648","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390556097533/Royal-Mail-005.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Matthew Lloyd","altText":"Royal Mail","height":"276","credit":"Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images","caption":"Royal Mail says the job cuts will save £50m.

SSE was the last supplier to pass on the government's levy cuts and reduce customer bills this winter – now they are the first to freeze prices until 2016. We welcome this commitment.</p><p>\"After another winter of rationing heating and hot water to cope with rising bills, SSE customers have at last been offered the peace of mind they desperately needed. It's our hope that the remaining big five energy firms follow SSE's lead and look at ways to offer consumers the same reassurance.\"</p><p>SSE also announced it is carrying out a legal separation of its wholesale arm – which includes energy production and storage – from its retail division which sells energy to homes and businesses.  It promised that staff would not face compulsory redundancies as it cuts jobs in a bid to save £100m a year. The company, formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, also said it was making arrangements to deal with the effects of the Scottish independence referendum, while insisting it remained neutral on the outcome.</p><p>The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said SSE's price freeze pledge increases the pressure on other energy companies to do the same. \"This will be welcome news for SSE's customers and shows that the government's work to reduce energy bills is working by lowering policy costs and driving competition. This shows that the big six are starting to realise they need to take big action if they want to keep their customers, who have been switching supplier in record numbers.</p><p>\"SSE have shown today that the big energy firms are able to cut their costs and profits, and be confident about their ability to weather potential uncertainty in the wholesale markets, to give bill payers long-term price security. Customers of the others will be asking whether their suppliers will do the same. The government encourages people to shop around for the best deal.\"</p><p></p><h2>What they said in 2013</h2><p></p><p><strong>Sir Roger Carr, chairman of British Gas owner Centrica</strong>, warned that price controls could be 'a recipe for economic ruin for a company'.</p><p></p><p><strong>SSE's Alistair Phillips-Davies</strong> said the freeze would 'lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses'</p><p></p><p><strong>Paul Massara, chief executive of RWE npower</strong>, said: 'If the Labour party can commit to reducing policy costs on household energy bills, stopping the smart meter roll-out, preventing commodity cost increases and accept that there won't be any investment in new power stations and infrastructure, then we could freeze our prices.'</p><p></p><p><strong>Angela Knight, head of Energy UK</strong>: 'Freezing the bill may be superficially attractive, but it will also freeze the money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs and livelihoods of the 600,000 plus people dependent on the energy industry and make the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone.'</p><p></p><p><strong>Adam Scorer, director at Consumer Futures</strong>, said: \"The prospect of a price freeze may ramp up prices in the short term and dismantling the structure of the market may put off decisions by energy companies or others to invest in new, cleaner generation capacity\".</p><p></p><p><strong>John Longworth, British Chambers of Commerce chief</strong>: 'Short-term price controls and green energy commitments could have a negative effect on Britain's energy security.'</p><p></p><p><strong>John Cridland, CBI director-general</strong>, said: 'The proposed energy price freeze will deter much-needed investment and is at odds with Labour's pledge to decarbonise the economy and create a million green jobs.'</p>","headline":"SSE pledges to hold gas and electricity prices until

Instead, because of a legal technicality, he will have to make do with £8,000 damages.</p><p></p><p>However, legal experts said the unanimous judgment in Durkin's favour could unleash a tidal wave of similar claims from people who argue that their lives were ruined after black marks were put on their credit files.</p><p></p><p>Andrew Smith QC, who represented the married father of two in court, indicated the ruling would make it much harder for banks and other financial firms to report people to credit reference agencies, leading to them being blacklisted for credit. He said the judgment meant that where a consumer disputes that he or she defaulted on a loan or credit agreement, the bank or firm cannot put a default notice on their credit file until the matter has been resolved.</p><p></p><p>\"It's victory, but they didn't have jurisdiction to help me in the end, which is disappointing,\" Durkin told the Guardian immediately after the judgment. \"But I'm pleased for the consumer. A lot of people will benefit from this – it's massive.\"</p><p></p><p>Had Durkin lost, he would almost certainly have faced bankruptcy, as he could have been hit with a legal bill for an estimated £300,000, on top of his own £250,000 legal bill.</p><p></p><p>His legal team is now likely to argue that HFC Bank, a division of HSBC, and PC World – the other party in the case – should pay their own costs, plus at least some of Durkin's.</p><p></p><p>Durkin took his case to the UK's highest court after claiming HFC wrecked his credit rating following a dispute over a credit agreement he signed when he bought the £1,500 laptop at his local PC World in Aberdeen in 1998.</p><p></p><p>He argued that being wrongly blacklisted meant he was unable to buy a home. Papers lodged with the court said Durkin alleged the bank's conduct \"amounted to extortion\".</p><p></p><p>The saga began on 28 December 1998, when Durkin, an offshore construction surveyor, went to PC World to buy a laptop. The sales assistant pointed out a particular model, but it was in a sealed box, so it was not possible to check whether it had the right modem. It is claimed that the assistant suggested Durkin buy the laptop, saying that if there was a problem he could return it and get his £50 deposit back. Durkin bought the computer, handed over his £50 and signed a credit agreement with HFC Bank, which provided PC World's in-store finance, for £1,449 to cover the balance. When he got home he found the laptop did not have an built-in modem, so he took it back the next morning. But the manager on duty refused to take the computer back, refund his £50 or cancel the agreement.</p><p></p><p>Durkin left the laptop at the shop, then went to work offshore, but when he got home a fortnight later he found the laptop waiting for him. He again took it back to the shop, where it stayed, and later sued PC World for the £50. The company paid up without admitting liability. Durkin assumed that was the end of the matter, but HFC Bank said he was still required to make payments under the terms of the agreement. He says he explained what had happened, but the bank warned that if he did not pay up, possible consequences included \"difficulty in the future in obtaining a mortgage or other credit\".</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, HFC Bank put a default notice on his Experian and Equifax credit files. Durkin says he tried without success to get these black marks removed, and they stayed on his files until at least 2005. This had a major impact on his finances and, he claimed, prevented him from buying a home in Spain in 2003.</p><p></p><p>The case eventually made it to Aberdeen sheriff court where, in March 2008, Durkin won his case. Sheriff James Tierney ruled he had been entitled to reject the laptop and cancel the sale and the credit agreement. The court awarded damages of £116,000 to Durkin. But, two years later, that decision was overturned by judges at the court of session in Edinburgh. They ruled that even though the sale of the laptop had been cancelled, the contract of sale and the contract of loan were separate agreements, and Durkin was not entitled to cancel his credit agreement. That meant the information put on his file about being in default was factually accurate, the court added.</p><p></p><p>Giving the judgment at the supreme court, Lord Hodge said Durkin had \"validly rescinded the credit agreement by giving notice to HFC in about February 1999\". But, in terms of the damages Durkin was seeking, Hodge said the Court of Session Act 1988 \"limits the role of the supreme court in relation to such appeals\", and that therefore the damages resulting from HFC's \"breach of its duty of care\" were confined to \"injury to Mr Durkin's credit in the sum of £8,000\".</p><p></p><p>Hodge said the bank could have tested the effectiveness of the credit agreement by suing Durkin, adding: \"It should not have intimated the default without a reasonable basis for the belief that it had occurred.\"</p><p></p><p>The legal row is seen as an important test case for thousands of people who say their lives have been ruined after black marks were put on their credit files, and is likely to open the floodgates to many similar cases.</p><p></p><p>Durkin said: \"Although I am disappointed that the supreme court was unable to restore to me the full damages awarded by the sheriff – even though it was clear they were sympathetic to my position – this decision is a great victory for all consumers, and I am proud to have been the driving force behind it. As a result of the decision, no consumer will have to endure again what I had to put up with: the loss of the ability to buy a family home because of wrongful blacklisting.</p><p></p><p>\"Taking a case to any court is a huge stress, but taking it to the highest court in the land with all the risks that go with it was the most stressful thing that anyone could voluntarily put themselves through.</p><p></p><p>\"But sometimes you have to do what is right and not what is easy. This case was not all about me – it was about principle for all consumers. I always felt that PC World and HFC Bank had acted disgracefully towards me, and I have now been proved right.\"</p><p></p><p>Durkin said he was grateful to his legal team and everyone who had worked on a pro bono basis to take the case.</p><p></p><p>\"But I am most grateful for an end to this matter now, having fought a long and difficult battle which at last is over,\" he added.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Smith said he had already received instructions from about 20 people who wished to follow Durkin's example in taking legal action on the grounds that they had suffered as a result of defaults being wrongly put on their files.</p><p></p><p>He said: \"There may be many people who have in the past been wrongly listed as being in default who potentially have rights to litigate now.\"</p><p></p><p>The case raised significant issues as to whether credit reference agencies such as Experian and Equifax \"are exposed to the risk of litigation if they incorrectly report or list someone as being in default\".</p>","headline":"Supreme court victory for man in 16-year battle with HSBC and PC World","trailText":"Bitter sweet verdict for Richard Durkin, who says his
