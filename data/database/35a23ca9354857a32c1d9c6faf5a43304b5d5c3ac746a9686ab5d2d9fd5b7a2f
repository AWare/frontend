But ice forming later than usual in recent years has compelled them to move to much thicker floating ice shelves.</p><p>Experts believe the unusual behaviour could indicate that the penguins are adapting to environmental change.</p><p>Lead scientist Dr Peter Fretwell, from the BAS, said: \"These charismatic birds tend to breed on the sea ice because it gives them relatively easy access to waters where they hunt for food.</p><p>\"Satellite observations captured of one colony in 2008, 2009 and 2010 show that the concentration of annual sea ice was dense enough to sustain a colony. But this was not the case in 2011 and 2012, when the sea ice did not form until a month after the breeding season began. During those years the birds moved up on to the neighbouring floating ice shelf to raise their young.</p><p>\"What's particularly surprising is that climbing up the sides of a floating ice shelf - which at this site can be up to 30 metres high - is a very difficult manoeuvre for emperor penguins. Whilst they are very agile swimmers they have often been thought of as clumsy out of the water.\"</p><p>The findings are reported in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE.</p><p>Because of their reliance on sea ice as a breeding platform, emperor penguins have been classified as \"near threatened\" in the IUCN's \"red list\" of endangered species.</p><p>Dr Barbara Wienecke, from the Australian Antarctic Division, who also took part in the research, said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals, however, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations.</p><p>\"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\"</p><p>Whereas sea-ice is frozen salt water, ice shelves consist of glacial ice that has flowed from the land to the sea.

The finding raises serious questions about the ethics of banding penguins for research and casts doubt on years of data produced by tagging the birds in this way.</p><p>Flipper banding, a technique that involves placing a band usually made of stainless steel under penguins' flippers to identify them, is used by some researchers to identify them and gather long-term information about their behaviour and ecology.</p><p>The latest available figures, from a study published in 2000, show that between 1988 and 1996, 36,000 penguins were flipper banded by scientists.</p><p>The study, published today by French researchers in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/\" title=\"\">Nature</a>, followed 100 penguins over 10 years, half of them with the bands and half without.</p><p>\"At the end of the study we had much higher numbers of non-banded than banded birds,\" said Claire Saraux, at the University of Strasbourg who co-authored the study.</p><p>Bands also heavily impacted the birds' breeding success. \"Banded birds would arrive later at the colony to breed and so they would begin breeding later. Our idea is because of the drag effect, they spend more time at sea and it takes them longer to swim back to the colony, so they are at a disadvantage,\" said Saraux.</p><p>The drag effect of the bands means the penguins swim slower and expend more energy than they otherwise would. In 1994, Prof Rory Wilson of Swansea University conducted a study which found that penguins with flipper bands used 24% more energy to swim.</p><p>The authors of the report say that while tracking penguins is essential to understanding changes in their population and the effects of various factors including rises in sea temperatures, flipper banding is problematic because it may distort the results.</p><p>\"As we show in our paper there is a drop in breeding success and it is known in sea birds that when this fails it induces immigration to other colonies so then there is a problem if you use flipper banding to study immigration. It will skew the numbers,\" said Yvon Le Maho, the report's lead author.</p><p>To track the non-banded birds in their study, Le Maho and Saraux used tiny electronic chips with radio transmissions. Le Maho says this is a possible alternative to flipper bands but that it presents other challenges.</p><p>\"The only difficulty is that once a bird is only with an electronic tag you need an antenna for identification – so to study immigration you need antennas in different colonies – you cannot do it simply by observation as you do with flipper bands but again [flipper bands] skew the data,\" he said.</p><p>Wilson, who has been studying penguins for three decades, said: \"The big question is does what you get from the study justify the cost – and the costs are increased mortality without a shadow of a doubt and decreased reproductive success.\"</p><p>\"It is going to be very difficult as a scientist to come back and defend flipper banding and the hope is that if people don't stop flipper banding they're at least cognisant of what it implicates,\" he said.</p><p>Wilson says although the practice has been in decline in recent years, there is no comprehensive ban or policy against it internationally.</p>","headline":"Tagging penguins limits survival chances, study shows","trailText":"<p>Survival rates for king penguins with flipper bands dropped by 16% and the birds

No such observation had ever been recorded before, as far as he knew, and Levick, a typical Edwardian Englishman, was horrified. Blizzards and freezing cold were one thing. Penguin perversion was another.</p><p>Worse was to come, however. Levick spent the Antarctic summer of 1911-12 observing the colony of Adélies at Cape Adare, making him the only scientist to this day to have studied an entire breeding cycle there. During that time, he witnessed males having sex with other males and also with dead females, including several that had died the previous year. He also saw them sexually coerce females and chicks and occasionally kill them.</p><p>Levick blamed this \"astonishing depravity\" on \"hooligan males\" and wrote down his observations in Greek so that only an educated gentleman would understand the horrors he had witnessed. Back in Britain he produced a paper (in English), titled <em>Natural History of the Adélie Penguin</em>. However, the section about the animal's sexual proclivities was deemed to be so shocking it was removed to preserve decency. Levick then used this material as the basis for a separate short paper, <em>Sexual Habits of the Adélie Penguin</em>, which was privately circulated among a handful of experts.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-391407027'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/9/1339253841673/Adelie-penguins-with-chic-001.jpg' alt='Adelie penguins with chick' width='220' height='204' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Two Adélie penguins with a chick. Steve Bloom/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Levick's observations  turned out to be well ahead of their time. Scientists had to wait another 50 years before the remarkable sexual antics of the Adélie were revealed. By this time his pamphlet and its detailed records of Adélie shenanigans had been lost to science.</p><p>But now a copy of <em>Sexual Habits of the Adélie Penguin</em> has been unearthed, thanks to sleuthing by Douglas Russell, curator of birds at the Natural History Museum, who discovered a copy among records of the work of Scott's expeditions and has had it published in the journal <em>Polar Record</em>, with an accompanying analysis of Levick's work.</p><p>\"The pamphlet, declined for publication with the official Scott expedition reports, commented on the frequency of sexual activity, auto-erotic behaviour, and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females, including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks and homosexual behaviour,\" states the analysis written by Russell and colleagues William Sladen and David Ainley. \"His observations were, however, accurate, valid and, with the benefit of hindsight, deserving of publication.\"</p><p>Levick's lost masterpiece certainly has its eye-watering moments with its descriptions of male Adélies who gather in \"little hooligan bands of half a dozen or more and hang about the outskirts of the knolls, whose inhabitants they annoy by their constant acts of depravity\". Injured females are mounted by members of these \"gangs\", others have their chicks \"misused before the very eyes of its parents\". Some chicks are crushed and injured, others are killed.</p><p>It is startling stuff, though Russell told the <em>Observer</em> that recent studies have helped understand the behaviour of these \"hooligan\" penguins. \"Adélies gather at their colonies in October to start to breed. They have only a few weeks to do that and young adults simply have no experience of how to behave. Many respond to inappropriate cues. Hence the seeming depravity of their behaviour. For example, a dead penguin, lying with its eyes half-open, is very similar in appearance to a compliant female. The result is the so-called necrophilia that Levick witnessed and which so disgusted him.\"</p><p>In addition, the penguin is the most humanlike of all birds in its appearance and its behaviour is most often interpreted in anthropomorphic terms, added Russell. For this reason, Adélie behaviour, when it was observed for the first time in detail, seemed especially shocking. \"Levick was also a gentleman, travelling with a group of men in very difficult circumstances, witnessing behaviour he neither expected nor understood,\" said Russell. \"It is not surprising that he was shocked by his findings.\"</p><p>The discovery of Levick's paper is important because its helps shed new light on a species that has been called the bellwether of climate change. \"The Adélie needs pack ice from which to dive to get fish. When that ice disappears, numbers may crash – and we will have a clear warning that things are getting bad,\" said Russell.</p><p>Levick's experiences with the Adélie penguins were not the only root of his suffering in the Antarctic. In February 1912, he and five other members of Scott's team were waiting to be picked up by the expedition ship, Terra Nova, but found that pack ice had blocked its route. The men had to spend an entire Antarctic winter huddled in an ice cave with no provisions and only an occasional seal or penguin to eat. \"They ate blubber, cooked with blubber, had blubber lamps,\" recalled one expedition member. \"Their clothes and gear were soaked with blubber, and the soot blackened them, their sleeping bags, cookers, walls and roof, choked their throats and inflamed their eyes.\"</p><p>Remarkably, the men all survived and Levick returned to England in 1913 – in time to sign up for the first world war. He served in the Grand Fleet and at Gallipoli, and after the war founded the British Schools Exploring Society in 1932, of which he was president until his death in June 1956. An obituary described him as \"a truly great English gentleman\".</p><p>• Levick's notebook is on display at the Natural History Museum until 2 September as part of the <a

Over the coming month, more than half a million <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/51d23041e4b0202f5347ab9d/420058\" title=\"\">sandhill cranes</a> will descend on the plains of the midwest where they'll take a breather en route to their breeding grounds in the north. Roosting on the Platte river at night, they take to the wing at sunrise and fill their stomachs with&nbsp;grain from the plentiful cornfields before returning to the banks as the sun sets replete with some much-needed calories for the&nbsp;onward journey.</p><p>It's a well-earned break. By the time they touch down in Nebraska, the cranes will have undertaken an epic journey from their wintering grounds in Mexico and the southern&nbsp;states, covering about 200-400 miles a day. And with the breeding grounds of some&nbsp;subspecies as far flung as Hudson Bay and even eastern Siberia, the journey for many is&nbsp;far&nbsp;from over.</p><p>Returning to \"stage\" along the same stretch of the river each year, the weary travellers are not only sure to find food and a spot to sleep, but also the chance to find a partner for life. With 80% of&nbsp;North America's sandhill cranes congregating along the river, the odds are good for the singletons; by&nbsp;the time the birds head off in early April, many will have found a&nbsp;mate.</p><p>Sporting grey plumage, white cheeks and a jaunty splash of red above their beaks, these handsome birds make for quite a spectacle as they strut their stuff along the river. And joining them are hundreds of enthusiasts who flock to the region every spring, armed with binoculars and cameras to catch sight of the phenomenon.</p><p>For those on the wrong side of the pond, there's no need to get in a flap at the thought of missing out – an online \"crane cam\", located at the Rowe Sanctuary on the edge of the Platte river, provides a remote glimpse of the action.</p><p>Just go to <a href=\"http://rowe.audubon.org/crane-cam\" title=\"\">rowe.audubon.org/crane-cam</a> to have a gander.</p>","headline":"Sandhill cranes descend on the&nbsp;plains of the US midwest","trailText":"A riverside in Nebraska is a welcome refuelling stop for these elegant birds en route from Mexico to their breeding grounds","newspaperPageNumber":"10","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/4/1393957781115/Cranes-gathering-together-007.jpg","wordcount":"310","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"431297427","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8757691","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nicola Davis","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2054017","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-10T11:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/07/sandhill-cranes-plains-nebraska-platte-breeding-migration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/07/sandhill-cranes-plains-nebraska-platte-breeding-migration","tags":[{"id":"environment/birds","webTitle":"Birds","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/birds","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/birds","references":[]},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife","references":[]},{"id":"world/animals","webTitle":"Animals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/animals","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/animals","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"world/nebraska","webTitle":"Nebraska","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nebraska","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nebraska","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicola-davis","webTitle":"Nicola Davis","rcsId":"Nicola Da","r2ContributorId":"58443","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/8/30/1377879747391/Dr-Nicola-Davis-004.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicola Davis joined the Observer as commissioning editor of Tech Monthly in 2013.

Migrating geese and waders are critically endangered as their breeding grounds start to vanish","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2000-04-03T07:17:18Z","body":"Five million geese and 7.5m sandpipers and other wading birds are threatened by global warming in the Arctic, a report warns today . <P>An estimated 10m geese and 14m sandpipers, dunlins and stints breed in the Arctic before migrating to Asia, Britain, Europe and North America.  <P>Released by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the study says that in a warmer world more than half of the Arctic tundra could be taken over by forests by 2070, removing vital breeding grounds from critically endangered birds such as the red breasted goose, the tundra bean goose, the spoon-billed sandpiper and the emperor goose.  <P>The study is published as leading scientists from northern nations head for an \"Arctic summit\" this week in Cambridge to assess the problems of climate change for life at the edge of the ice. Its authors, Christoph Zockler and Igor Lysenko of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge, looked at the impact of temperature change on the nesting success of geese, and the effect of warming on the birds' natural habitat.  <P>They found that the Greenland white fronted goose, which winters only in the British Isles and numbers only 33,000, could be in serious trouble, with the western part of Greenland getting colder and tundra disappearing. Another British visitor bird, the knot, could flourish in warmer weather but would be affected by the sea level rises.  <P>The two scientists considered two scenarios. In one -where the planet's average temperature warms by 1.7C by 2070 - the red breasted goose would lose 50% of its habitat. But if the worst fears of climate scientists are realised, and the planet's average temperature rises by 5C, the red breasted goose would lose 99% of its nesting places.  <P>Governments are under pressure to limit discharges of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which fuel global warming. Ute Collier, of WWF's climate change programme, said: \"Birds do not have political boundaries, they are global, breeding in the Arctic and migrating elsewhere.\"  <P>There are about 10,000 species of birds. About 1,000 of these are at risk of extinction   already. So far, most concern has been about temperate and tropical forest birds. But the Arctic is sensitive to any climate change, and many predictions of global warming expect temperature rises in the sub-Arctic regions to be much greater than in the tropics.  <P>Winter is in retreat. The growing season in Europe is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. Sea levels have crept higher throughout the century. Six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s; the other four all happened in the late 1980s.  <P>Arctic birds are vulnerable even when their breeding conditions improve. With an earlier spring and higher June temperatures, they could do well and so could trees moving up from the south. But the following year, with more birds competing for fewer nesting spaces, robust species would survive while others perished. The study predicts the spoon-billed sandpiper, which numbers only up to about 2,800, will lose 56% of its habitat.  <P>Dr Collier said: \"There is still a lot we can do. If we get emissions down in the next 20 to 30 years, we will probably only see about half the increase in these temperatures. Species can adapt to slow change. It is an important message.\"","headline":"Warmer Arctic puts 12m birds under threat","trailText":"Five million geese and 7.5m sandpipers and other wading birds are threatened by global warming in the Arctic, a report warns today .

The result was a <a href=\"http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm\">treaty system</a> that ensures Antarctica will continue to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not become an object of international discord. <br />  <br />Yet as nations <a href=\"http://www.atcm2009.gov/\">gather again</a> to celebrate the Antarctic treaty system's 50th anniversary this spring, new scientific research indicates that many species of penguins, some of the Antarctic's most iconic residents, are in deep trouble.   <br />  <br />While the plight of the polar bear may be better known, emperor penguins are also going to be hit hard by the effects of global warming. Made famous by the documentary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB_GisVFboU\">March of the Penguins</a>, these flightless birds use the Antarctic's sea ice as a breeding ground and base for feeding on krill, fish and squid. But projected changes in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/04/07/ST2009040700783.html\">Antarctic sea ice due to global warming</a> will dramatically change the environment for these penguins and countless other species. <br />  <br />Indeed, a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/01/tech/main4222124.shtml\">2008 study</a> by a number of leading penguin experts warned that \"50% of Emperor colonies ... and 75% of Adelie colonies ... that currently exist at latitudes north of 70 degrees S are in jeopardy of marked decline or disappearance, largely because of severe decreases in pack-ice coverage.\" <br />  <br />Making matters worse, these penguins increasingly must compete with man for their principal food: a small, yet invaluable shrimp-like animal known as <a href=\"http://www.krillcount.org/krill.html\">Antarctic krill</a>. Measuring only five to six centimetres in size, krill comprise the largest biomass in the Southern Ocean. These tiny creatures, rich in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/01/medicalresearch.health\">omega-3 oils</a> used in health supplements, are seen by some corporations  as a potential source of big profits. <br />  <br />The Norwegian-based firm <a href=\"http://www.nutraingredients.com/Industry/Aker-BioMarine-joins-budding-krill-oil-market\">Aker Biomarine</a>, one of the globe's leading krill fishing companies, recently applied to have its Antarctic krill fishery certified by the <a href=\"http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/in-assessment/southern-ocean/aker-biomarine-antarctic-krill\">Marine Stewardship Council</a> (MSC). The council attempts to provide market-based tools to promote sustainably caught fish. To accomplish this, the MSC works with fisheries, seafood companies, scientists, conservation groups and the public to promote the best \"environmental choice\" in seafood. Yet while the council's mission is important, certifying the krill fishery would stymie further efforts to more effectively conserve and manage Antarctic resources.   <br />  <br />Certifying a fishery like Antarctic krill is far more complex than it may seem. Although overall catches appear relatively low as compared to total krill abundance, uncertainties exist about the local impact of fishing operations since they often overlap with the feeding areas of krill predators.   <br />  <br />When it comes to krill and other forage species, MSC's standards fall far short of achieving its goal of sustainability. In certifying a fishery, the council considers the sustainability of fish stocks - seeking to minimize environmental impacts and maximize effective management. The problem is that it measures mortality rates as though the animals were in an aquarium without predators. In reality, krill are part of a living system where there are many pressures apart from fishing.  Yet, the MSC's process to assess potential krill certification does not take adequate account of the role that krill serve in anchoring the Antarctic food chain.   <br />  <br />Furthermore, according to a recently published study by the National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research Programme, \"Over the past 50 years, winter temperatures on the [Antarctic] Peninsula have risen five times faster than the global average.\" Krill are sensitive to warmer waters and thus less abundant there. Nonetheless, climate change and the complexity of ecosystem interactions are not adequately accounted for in the current management process.   <br />  <br />Governments, acting jointly through administrative bodies of the Antarctic treaty system (such as the <a href=\"http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/cc/intro.htm\">Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</a>) need to impose precautionary fishery management measures sufficient to ensure that enough krill are left to meet the needs of penguins and other predators.

This meant thay could stock up on more food to fuel their spring flight.</p><p>Ross Dwyer and three colleagues measured the moonlight and cloud cover against the amount of artificial light in the Forth estuary at night using <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/\" title=\"\">satellite images from the US Air Force</a> – the first time such technology has been used in animal behaviour research.</p><p>The team then worked out how the light affected the birds' foraging behaviour by attaching tiny radio transmitters to the backs of 20 redshanks. The devices monitored the birds' location and contained posture sensors to detect how often the birds put their heads down to feed on their diet of molluscs, worms and crustaceans.</p><p>The birds generally forage for food by sight during the day, which provides them with the most food. Feeding in the day for shorebirds during winter does not produce enough energy for them to survive, so many species are forced to feed less efficiently at night by locating prey through probing and sweeping the sand with their bills.</p><p>Dwyer said: \"Artificial light from industrial areas strongly influenced the foraging strategy of our tagged birds. It was as if the 24-hour light emitted from lamps and flares on the Grangemouth oil refinery site created, in effect, a perpetual full moon across the local inter-tidal area which the birds seemed to capitalise on by foraging for longer periods at night and switching to a potentially more effective foraging behaviour to locate prey.\"</p><p>Intertidal zones along exposed coastlines and estuaries provide essential habitat for migrating shorebirds, who spend winter feeding and building up their body reserves to make the return trip to summer breeding grounds. Every year millions of waterbirds arrive from the Arctic to UK coasts, but until now scientists have not known how these birds respond to the bright lights of coastal cities and industry.</p><p>Light pollution is more commonly thought to have negative effects on wildlife, particularly animals that move between the land and sea. Previous research found artificial light caused <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/12/tourism-turtles-kenya-population\" title=\"\">newly hatched turtles to head away from the sea</a> and caused seabirds such as <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/34089/\" title=\"\">petrels to collide with lighthouses</a> and other lit structures.</p><p>Redshanks are medium-sized wading birds named for their long bright orange or red legs.

But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/10/early-spring\" title=\"\">recent winters have been ending earlier</a> than ever before, according to a new assessment of Britain's wildlife that reveals global warming could be disrupting the delicate balance of nature.</p><p>The analysis confirms that spring and summer are occurring earlier, but also shows that this trend appears to be accelerating. The shift could pose problems for animals, birds and fish that rely on springtime flowering of plants to supply food for their young.</p><p>Stephen Thackeray, a biologist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Lancaster, who co-led the research said: \"This is about the desynchronisation of events during the year. Animals and birds time their reproduction to coincide with periods when there will be an abundance of food. If changes mean there is not enough food available then this could have negative consequences for their offspring.\"</p><p>The new study compiled 25,000 records of springtime trends for 726 species of plants, animals, plankton, insects, amphibians, birds and fish across land, sea and freshwater habitats. It analysed them for changes in the timing of lifecycle events, such as egg laying, first flights and flowering, a science known as phenology.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123233053/abstract\" title=\"\">results showed that more than 80% of trends between 1976 and 2005 indicated earlier seasonal events</a>. On average, the study showed the seasonal timing of reproduction and population growth shifted forward by eleven days over the period, and that the change has accelerated recently.</p><p>Thackeray said: \"This is the first time that data have been analysed with enough consistency to allow a meaningful comparison of patterns of changing seasonal timing in the UK among such a diverse range of plants and animals.\"</p><p>The study used records drawn from the work of thousands of volunteers who, as part of the UK phenology network, have made painstaking observations of the behaviour of wildlife in gardens and public spaces. It also relies on professional scientists, who have analysed habitats such as the plankton content of water drawn from lakes and coastal waters.</p><p>The research, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1354-1013\" title=\"\">Global Change Biology</a>, found large differences between species in the rate at which seasonal events have altered. Changes have been most rapid for many organisms at the bottom of food chains, such as plants and the animals that eat them. Predators have shown slower overall changes in the seasonal timing of their lifecycle events. This could spell problems, as the seasonal timing of reproduction is often matched to the time of year when food supply increases, so that offspring receive food needed to survive. A key question, the scientists say, is whether animals higher up the food chain can adapt to the faster rates of change in the plants and animals they feed on.</p><p>Sarah Wanless, who also co-led the research, said: \"It is important to realise that this analysis doesn't identify which predator-prey relationships are most at risk from disruption due to changes in timing. What is does do is highlight that the recorded changes need urgent investigation, particularly for species with high economic or conservation importance.\"</p><p>Not all of the species showed a shift to earlier lifecycle events. Some, such as seabirds, now lay their eggs later in the year than they did before. But the scientists said the overall results show that climate warming is having an impact, and that the effect could get worse as temperatures continue to rise.</p><p>Richard Smithers of the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Woodland Trust</a> said: \"Phenology is the canary in the cage. The results of this new study make real our changing climate and its potential to have profound consequences for the complex web of life.\"</p><p>Thackeray said it was difficult to generalise about how the changing climate has affected individual species across Britain, because most of the observations were for specific locations. One study found that oak trees were producing leaves 0.9 days earlier each year, while another found blue tits had changed their time of egg laying by 0.3 days a year. Other research found that hazel flowered a day earlier, and orange tip butterflies took their first flights 0.7 days earlier.</p><p>The study involved scientists from 12 UK research institutions, including Butterfly Conservation, Freshwater Biological Association, People's Trust for Endangered Species and the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at the University of Worcester.</p><p>Many of the organisations have now started follow-on research to see which species could be negatively affected by the change in timings and what could be done to help.</p><p>Writing in the journal, the scientists warn: \"If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, future climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching, further disrupting the functioning, persistence and resilience of major ecosystems and having a major impact on ecosystem services.\"</p>","headline":"Earlier springs could destroy delicate balance of UK
