These insects share a fondness for feces, subsisting either partially or entirely on animal dung. Scarabs are coprophagists -- shit eaters. There are more than 5000 species of dung beetles, and although they are found on every continent except Antartica, nearly all of them occur in warmer and moister regions of the world. They devote their adult lives to locating, collecting and secreting away the dung of animals. Most scarabid species specialise on the dung of one or a few animal species, and they prefer the droppings of herbivores to those of omnivores, and both are preferred to the turds produced by meat-eating animals. </p><p>This specialisation has led to problems. For example, after cattle were introduced to Australia, parts of that continent were plagued by huge swarms of flies that laid its eggs on cow shit during the summer months. Since the resident dung beetles specialised on marsupial turds, cattle poop remained untouched and over the years, vast areas were transformed into a giant, nearly continuous cow pat. Taking advantage of this situation, flies rapidly grew into pestilential swarms. In the 1970s, 20 or so species of African dung beetles were introduced to deal with the problem, which then reduced the number of flies by as much as 90 percent.</p><p>Ancient Egyptians celebrated scarabs for their diligence and industry and indeed, a single elephant turd, which can weigh in excess of three pounds (roughly one-and-a-half kilos), is typically dispersed within just a few hours by tens of thousands of these insects. <img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7455/8727199091_1bc1627551_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"77\" />Even today, dung beetles are admired: for example, the New York Entomological Society uses a scarab in its logo, replacing its prized dung ball with the planet Earth -- make of that what you will (right). </p><p>Although some beetles simply drag away bits of fresh poop and deposit them in waiting subterranean chambers, many dung beetles form their prized poop into a ball, which they then roll away, pushing with their front legs and using their hind legs to hold the ball as it spins on an invisible axle. Some species work as a team, and in other species, the male does the poop-pushing whilst the female catches a ride on top. </p><p>After the dung ball has reached its burial chamber, the female lays one or more eggs inside (this differs between species, of course), and when the larva hatches, it is surrounded by dinner. In some species, the adults remain with the dug ball to protect their growing brood, a form of parental care. </p><p>Sometimes, dung beetles get lost, which is probably not difficult when standing on your front legs to push a dung ball around. When this happens, the beetle stops rolling, climbs aboard  the dung ball and orients itself by observing the sun, moon and polarised light. At night, they orient themselves using the Milky Way -- making them the only animal (beside humans) to use the Milky Way to navigate [doi:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cub.2012.12.034\">10.1016/j.cub.2012.12.034</a>]. </p><p>This charming video shows us a little more about dung beetles:</p><p>[<a href=\"http://youtu.be/Q1zbgd6xpGQ\">video link</a>]</p><p><strong>Cited:</strong> </p><p>Dacke M., Baird E., Byrne M., Scholtz C. &amp; Warrant E.

One of my favourite bird families, the birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae), live only on New Guinea, a few nearby islands, and a small area of northern Australia. The birds-of-paradise form a family of songbirds comprised of 39 (or 41) species. These birds, whose ancestor was a member of the crow family, evolved a spectacular range of plumage colours, structures and patterns that the males display in complex courtship dances to woo females. </p><p>Long known about by Western scientists, artists and explorers, these birds are poorly understood because few people have seen them in nature. They live in the most remote, rugged and inacessible areas on Earth, which makes them almost impossible to watch, to study, and to photograph. </p><p>\"Nature seems to have taken every precaution that these, her choicest treasures, may not lose value by being too easily obtained\", as Wallace wrote in a paper published in the <em>Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</em> in 1862 (p. 160). </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/12851574605_bff54ac331_q.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> Enter the Birds-of-paradise Project. In 2003, wildlife photojournalist Tim Laman was on assignment for National Geographic to photograph the birds-of-paradise. He teamed up with Ed Scholes, a graduate student at the <a href=\"http://www.ku.edu/\">University of Kansas</a> who was studying the <em>Parotia</em> birds-of-paradise for his Ph.D. </p><p>When Laman's National Geographic article was published in 2007, they had managed to photograph half of all birds-of-paradise species. Of course, this inspired Scholes and Laman to plan to document the remainder of these birds. The <a href=\"http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478\">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/explorers/grants-programs/expeditions-council/\">National Geographic Expeditions Council</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx\">Conservation International</a> provided the funding necessary for the team to conduct additional expeditions into ever more remote parts of New Guinea. </p><p>By the time they photographed the last species eight years later, Scholes and Laman had made 18 expeditions, stayed in 51 different field camps, climbed hundreds of trees, built dozens of blinds, made thousands of video and audio recordings, spent more than a year and a half of cumulative time in the field, and taken more than 39,000 photos. The last species they documented? The Jobi manucode, <em>Manucodia jobiensis</em>, a glossy blue-black bird that outshines an obsidian.  </p><p>You can purchase some of Laman and Scholes' remarkable photographs, which are featured in their book, Birds of Paradise: Revealing the World's Most Extraordinary Birds [National Geographic, 2012; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781426209581\">Guardian Bookshop</a>;  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1426209584/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1426209584/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>].

The reader sees what computer code looks like, and gains a general appreciation for how it provides the framework for how a computer game makes decisions.

True, it's a children's book, but it could have presented more substance and detail. For example, although the book primarily focuses on the history of video games consoles like Playstation, X-Box and Wii, it provides no sense for how these technologies fit in with the larger technological landscape nor for where video game technology is headed. The explanations provide only the briefest of glimpses into the function of video games. Additionally, the photographs that include people are heavily male-dominated, including only one female programmer, one female store clerk -- and no female gamers. Further, this book is overpriced. </p><p>Targeted to children between the ages of 10 and 13 years old, this book is a credible introduction to the technologies associated with video games but there is little of substance that would interest anyone with more than the most basic knowledge of video games or programming (even if they happen to be in the target group).</p><p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p><p><em>Disclaimer: This review is based on a PDF e-galley provided by NetGalley and read using bluefire reader.

But while the poems are all involved in some way with the rural Midwest, particularly with the people and land of the northwestern Illinois dairy farm where Austin Smith was born and raised, they are anything but merely regional. As the poems reflect on farm life, they open out to speak about childhood and death, the loss of tradition, the destruction of the natural world, and the severing of connections between people and the land.<br />This collection also reflects on a long poetic apprenticeship. Smith's father is a poet himself, and Almanac is in part a meditation about the responsibility of the poet, especially the young poet, when it falls to him to speak for what is vanishing. To quote another Illinois poet, Thomas James, Smith has attempted in this book to write poems \"clear as the glass of wine / on [his] father's table every Christmas Eve.\" By turns exhilarating and disquieting, this is a remarkable debut from a distinctive new voice in American poetry.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> I've been reading this book, one poem per day, for a few weeks now. Although I didn't particularly relate to the poems about family, the poems about farm life -- especially the poem about how to euthanise a horse -- stayed with me for quite awhile. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/10408096785_a92890454c_m.jpg\" width=\"157\" height=\"240\" /> Nothing: From absolute zero to cosmic oblivion – amazing insights into nothingness [New Scientist, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846685187\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846685184/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846685184/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DR20LEI/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Zero, zip, nada, zilch. It's all too easy to ignore the fascinating possibilities of emptiness and non-existence, and we may well wonder what there is to say about nothing. But scientists have known for centuries that nothing is the key to understanding absolutely everything, from why particles have mass to the expansion of the universe -- so without nothing we'd be precisely nowhere.<br />Absolute zero (the coldest cold that can exist) and the astonishing power of placebos, light bulbs, superconductors, vacuums, dark energy, 'bed rest' and the birth of time -- all are different aspects of the concept of nothing. The closer we look, the bigger the subject gets. Why do some animals spend all day doing nothing? What happens in our brains when we try to think about nothing?<br />With chapters by 20 science writers, including top names such as Ian Stewart, Marcus Chown, Nigel Henbest, Michael Brooks, Paul Davies and David Fisher, this fascinating and intriguing book revels in a subject that has tantalised the finest minds for centuries, and shows there's more to nothing than meets the eye.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> For being a book about nothing, this book is really quite something. It has six chapters, each of which explores some aspect of nothingness, and is comprised of between three and five essays by different authors, all of which can be read between subway stops. I deliberately chose to read the essays by the book's female contributors and they were all delightful. For example, Valerie Jamieson's essay, \"Boring-ology: a happy tedium\", which describes her search for the most tedious activities known to humans -- watching grass grow, watching paint dry and the like -- was quite fun. Other informative and well-written essays include \"Wastes of Space?\" where author Laura Spinney chases down the evolutionary reasons that humans have vestigial structures -- wisdom teeth, appendix, coccyx; Helen Pilcher's \"When mind attacks body\" where she investigates how voodoo gets its power to kill; and Jo Marchand's essay, \"Heal Thyself\", investigates the power of the placebo effect and of positive thinking to tap into our inner medicine chest to speed healing, slow aging and reduce stress. This engaging book is worth reading, either in one big gulp or in a series of shorter intervals. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3687/10362968033_a1a4a5432e_m.jpg\" width=\"152\" height=\"240\" /> Social: Why our brains are wired to connect by Matthew D. Lieberman [Oxford University Press, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199645046\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199645043/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307889092/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CCPII14/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Why are we influenced by the behaviour of complete strangers? Why does the brain register similar pleasure when I perceive something as 'fair' or when I eat chocolate? Why can we be so profoundly hurt by bereavement? What are the evolutionary benefits of these traits? The young discipline of 'social cognitive neuroscience' has been exploring this fascinating interface between brain science and human behaviour since the late 1990s. <br />Now one of its founding pioneers, Matthew D. Lieberman, presents the discoveries that he and fellow researchers have made. Using fMRI scanning and a range of other techniques, they have been able to see that the brain responds to social pain and pleasure the same way as physical pain and pleasure; and that unbeknown to ourselves, we are constantly 'mindreading' other people so that we can fit in with them. It is clear that our brains are designed to respond to and be influenced by others. For good evolutionary reasons, he argues, we are wired to be social. <br />The implications are numerous and profound. Do we have to rethink what we understand by identity, and free will? How can managers improve the way their teams relate and perform? Could we organize large social institutions in ways that would work far better? And could there be whole new methods of education?<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Now this is a compelling and thought-provoking book. I read chapter four, \"The cost of free will\", and was intrigued by the studies cited and the ideas that the research findings appeared to support. The chapter ends with an interesting quote that gives me (as an atheist) some provocative ideas to mull over:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Finally, just because something doesn't really exist doesn't mean that believing that it does is pointless. Fantasy doesn't really exist but the world would be a much more impoverished place without storytelling. (p. 153.)</p></blockquote><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/10362898655_1af3ccd788_m.jpg\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" /> Careless Thought Costs Lives: The Ethics of Transplants by Janet Radcliffe Richards [Oxford University Press, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199678778\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199678774/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199678774/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/changethis/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Everyone knows that transplantation can save and transform lives, but thousands die every year on waiting lists because there are not enough organs available. If more people could be persuaded to donate, more lives could be saved. But is individual reluctance to donate the root of the problem? Individual choices are made against the background of prevailing laws, conventions and institutions, and many of those present direct or indirect obstacles to organ procurement, from both the living and the dead. If any of those cannot be justified, the deaths they cause are similarly unjustified. <br />In The Ethics of Transplants, Janet Radcliffe Richards, a leading moral philosopher and author of The Sceptical Feminist and Human Nature after Darwin, casts a sharp critical eye over these institutional barriers to organ procurement, and the logic of the arguments offered in their defence. Her incisive reasoning forces us to confront the implications of unexamined intuitions, leads to several unexpected conclusions, and in doing so demonstrates the crucial importance of clear thinking in public debate.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Since medical technology has advanced to a point where organ transplants are not uncommon, this raises a suite of important ethical considerations. The author, a philosopher, is mainly targeting readers who have little or no knowledge of philosophy. She outlines her arguments and caveats for obtaining organs that are suitable for transplant -- but she does not discuss the issues associated with who should get those limited organs nor how we should choose recipients. This interesting book is thought-provoking and would be a useful guide for medical doctors and other health-care workers as they develop their own ethical guidelines for organ transplants.</p><p>What book(s) are you reading?

Temperatures were down six degrees; ice sheets kilometres thick buried much of Europe and North America and sea levels were 130m lower. The following 15 millennia saw an astonishing transformation as our planet metamorphosed into the temperate world upon which our civilisation has grown and thrived. One of the most dynamic periods in Earth history saw rocketing temperatures melt the great ice sheets like butter on a hot summer's day; feeding torrents of freshwater into ocean basins that rapidly filled to present levels. The removal of the enormous weight of ice at high latitudes caused the crust to bounce back triggering earthquakes in Europe and North America and provoking an unprecedented volcanic outburst in Iceland. A giant submarine landslide off the coast of Norway sent a tsunami crashing onto the Scottish coast while around the margins of the continents the massive load exerted on the crust by soaring sea levels encouraged a widespread seismic and volcanic rejoinder. <br />In many ways, this post-glacial world mirrors that projected to arise as a consequence of unmitigated climate change driven by human activities. Already there are signs that the effects of climbing global temperatures are causing the sleeping giant to stir once again. Could it be that we are on track to bequeath to our children and their children not only a far hotter world, but also a more geologically fractious one?<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Call me a sceptic with regards to the relationship between climate change and earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic collapses, but this book presents cogent, clearly-argued evidence that supports this premise. I read chapter 5, \"Earth in Motion\", which discusses volcanoes, particularly those that I knew as near neighbours in my youth (one of which exploded and dropped part of itself onto my head). The author discusses ancient volcanic collapses -- how we know they happened, what we know of them from computer models and what the climate conditions were that triggered them -- and compares these findings to what we see happening today due to climate change. Needless to say, although the data and evidence are fascinating, they are not comforting. Oh no, not comforting at all. I am still trying to wrap my brain around a 400 metre tall tsunami wave, such as those generated by a volcanic collapse that crashed into Hawaii's Kohala volcano. Hugely fascinating reading. Great nightmare material (best not read immediately before bedtime). </p><p>The author tells us a little about his book:</p><p>[<a href=\"http://youtu.be/QDWNPbGjm38\">Video link</a>]</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2829/9217028882_94f52d583e_m.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" /> Reproductive Politics (What Everyone Needs to Know) by Rickie Solinger [Oxford University Press, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199811410\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199811415/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199811415/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BVJ7JAI/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> The term \"reproductive politics\" was coined by feminists in the 1970s to describe contemporary Roe v. Wade-era power struggles over contraception and abortion, adoption and surrogacy, and other satellite issues. Forty years later, questions about reproductive rights are just as complex -- and controversial -- as they were then. Focusing mainly on the United States, Reproductive Politics explores the legal, political, religious, social, ethical, and medical dimensions of this hotly contested arena. <br />Tracing the historical roots of reproductive politics up through the present, Rickie Solinger considers a range of topics from abortion and contraception to health care reform and assisted reproductive technologies. Solinger tackles some of the most contentious questions up for debate today, including the definition of \"fetal personhood,\" and the roles poverty and welfare policy play in shaping reproductive rights. The answers she provides are informative, balanced, and sometimes quite surprising. <br />Offering a wide range of information in an accessible and engaging manner, Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know orients readers and provides the knowledge necessary to follow the debates in this important and continually evolving field.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Written in no-nonsense language, this book is sobering and disturbing. It's essential reading, and it's well-written, but dang, it's a bit scary in places, too. This book could be a good inspiration for a fictional account of what could happen if the worst case scenario comes about.</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/9217259074_c6e1918972_m.jpg\" width=\"188\" height=\"240\" /> A Victorian Naturalist: Beatrix Potter's Drawings from the Armitt Collection by Anne Stevenson Hobbs, Eileen Jay and Beatrix Potter [Frederick Warne &amp; Co., 1992; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0723239908/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0723239908/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> One of the most unusual collections of Beatrix Potter's art is held by a small trust in the English Lake District, the Armitt Library in Ambleside, Cumbria.

It's filled with full-colour reproductions of Beatrix Potter's paintings and sketches that are held by the Armitt Museum, along with some of her handwritten letters and black-and-white photographs of her and some of her family and friends. The book tells the story that I want to read, that of her \"lost years\" as a naturalist, but the writing is far less engaging than the illustrations, which are, to my eye, the primary reason to obtain this book.</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/9214513783_d6624caae7_m.jpg\" width=\"182\" height=\"240\" /> The Crossley ID Guide: Raptors by Richard Crossley, Jerry Liguori and Brian Sullivan [Princeton University Press, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691157405\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691157405/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691157405/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Part of the revolutionary Crossley ID Guide series, this is the first raptor guide with lifelike scenes composed from multiple photographs -- scenes that allow you to identify raptors just as the experts do. Experienced birders use the most easily observed and consistent characteristics -- size, shape, behavior, probability, and general color patterns. The book's 101 scenes -- including thirty-five double-page layouts -- provide a complete picture of how these features are all related. Even the effects of lighting and other real-world conditions are illustrated and explained. Detailed and succinct accounts from two of North America's foremost raptor experts, Jerry Liguori and Brian Sullivan, stress the key identification features. This complete picture allows everyone from beginner to expert to understand and enjoy what he or she sees in the field. The mystique of bird identification is eliminated, allowing even novice birders to identify raptors quickly and simply.<br />Comprehensive and authoritative, the book covers all thirty-four of North America's diurnal raptor species (all species except owls). Each species is featured in stunning color plates that show males and females, in a full spectrum of ages and color variants, depicted near and far, in flight and at rest, and from multiple angles, all caught in their typical habitats. There are also comparative, multispecies scenes and mystery photographs that allow readers to test their identification skills, along with answers and full explanations in the back of the book. In addition, the book features an introduction, and thirty-four color maps accompany the plates.<br />Whether you are a novice or an expert, this one-of-a-kind guide will show you an entirely new way to look at these spectacular birds.<br /><ul><li> The most complete guide to North American raptors, written by some of the foremost experts</li>\n<li> The first raptor guide using Richard Crossley's acclaimed, innovative composite images that show birds as they actually appear in the field</li>\n<li> 101 stunning color plates -- including thirty-five double-page layouts -- composed from thousands of photographs</li>\n<li> Comparative, multispecies plates and photos of mystery species that allow readers to test their growing identification skills</li>\n<li> Complete with introduction, 34 color maps, and detailed species accounts</li></ul> <br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> If you think this book is a field guide, well, you'd be wrong. Written by North America's top raptor birders, this book is filled with photographic quizzes in the front half of the book, and in the back half are colour-coded range maps that accompany expanded life history information about the diurnal \"raptors\" in North America. The three North American vulture species are included, even though they are not raptors, and owls -- even day-flying owls -- are excluded. Inside the front cover is a photo guide for identifying soaring birds along with relevant pages in the book for more information. If you want to learn how to identify North American raptors at a glance whilst they are mere specks in a cloudy sky, then this book is the one you want. Beautifully executed, this book is suitable either for a course of self-study or as a textbook for a raptor ID class. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/9214439865_d1e93b68fa_m.jpg\" width=\"153\" height=\"240\" /> The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia (9th Edition) by Frank Knight, Graham Pizzey &amp; Sarah Pizzey [Harper Collins, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0732291933/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0732291933/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> The definitive and most respected guide to Australian bird identification, this book is a must for both experts and amateurs. First published in 1980, Graham Pizzey′s Field Guide to the Birds of Australia combines a depth and breadth of knowledge with beautiful, full-colour illustrations by Frank Knight. Comprehensive and fully updated, this 9th edition of the Guide is more user-friendly than ever before. Species entries have been re-ordered and updated to reflect the new taxonomy, and the book has been expanded to include eighteen new species as well as a new section on vagrant species. It also features new information on bird family groups, more than 750 distribution maps based on the most recent bird atlas data, as well as a new Quick Find Index, to assist with quick identification of birds in the field. This is the essential reference for every bird enthusiast.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> This is the best, most complete, field guide to the birds of Australia. However, that said, I noticed an error on my quick inspection of the book: the red-collared lorikeet, <em>Trichoglossus rubritorquis</em>, is listed as part of the rainbow lorikeet radiation, <em>T. haematodus</em>, although almost all authorities consider the red-collared lorikeet to be a separate (although closely-related) species. Some users may be dismayed by the lack of arrows (or other method) in the illustrations as an aid to quickly picking out distinguishing field marks. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3823/9214351835_08efcb5f89_m.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"240\" /> Britain's Hoverflies: An Introduction to the Hoverflies of Britain by Stuart Ball and Roger Morris [Princeton University Press, 2013; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691156590\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115659X/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115659X/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/changethis/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Britain's Hoverflies is a beautifully illustrated photographic field guide to all the genera of hoverflies found in Britain, focusing on the species most likely to be identified.

How can reposting on Twitter kill a movie's opening weekend? How can you use mathematics to find your celebrity look-alike? What is Homer Simpson's method for disproving Fermat's Last Theorem? Each topic in this refreshingly inviting book illustrates a famous mathematical algorithm or result -- such as Google's PageRank and the traveling salesman problem -- and the applications grow more challenging as you progress through the chapters. But don't worry, helpful solutions are provided each step of the way.<br />Math Bytes shows you how to do calculus using a bag of chocolate chips, and how to prove the Euler characteristic simply by doodling. Generously illustrated in color throughout, this lively and entertaining book also explains how to create fractal landscapes with a roll of the dice, pick a competitive bracket for March Madness, decipher the math that makes it possible to resize a computer font or launch an Angry Bird -- and much, much more. All of the applications are presented in an accessible and engaging way, enabling beginners and advanced readers alike to learn and explore at their own pace -- a bit and a byte at a time.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Printed on glossy paper and filled with colourful photographs, illustrations and diagrams on nearly every page, this book discusses mathematical ideas that can help us make sense of the digital world. The author's offbeat viewpoint comes from a truly unusual background; he studied mime with the legendary Marcel Marceau whilst pursuing his doctorate in applied maths. Of course, that the first draft of this book was completed whilst the author on sabbatical at the University of Washington in Seattle (my alma mater) probably helped inspire him, too. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/13902447969_ebd8c5213b_m.jpg\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" /> Everyday Calculus: Discovering the Hidden Math All Around Us by Oscar E. Fernandez [Princeton University Press, 2014; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691157559\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691157553/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691157553/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00HBFGEQ6/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Calculus. For some of us, the word conjures up memories of ten-pound textbooks and visions of tedious abstract equations. And yet, in reality, calculus is fun, accessible, and surrounds us everywhere we go. In Everyday Calculus, Oscar Fernandez shows us how to see the math in our coffee, on the highway, and even in the night sky.<br />Fernandez uses our everyday experiences to skillfully reveal the hidden calculus behind a typical day's events. He guides us through how math naturally emerges from simple observations -- how hot coffee cools down, for example -- and in discussions of over fifty familiar events and activities. Fernandez demonstrates that calculus can be used to explore practically any aspect of our lives, including the most effective number of hours to sleep and the fastest route to get to work. He also shows that calculus can be both useful -- determining which seat at the theater leads to the best viewing experience, for instance -- and fascinating -- exploring topics such as time travel and the age of the universe. Throughout, Fernandez presents straightforward concepts, and no prior mathematical knowledge is required. For advanced math fans, the mathematical derivations are included in the appendixes.<br />Whether you're new to mathematics or already a curious math enthusiast, Everyday Calculus invites you to spend a day discovering the calculus all around you. The book will convince even die-hard skeptics to view this area of math in a whole new way.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Yep, another maths book! This book follows one mathematician as he goes through a typical Friday, from the moment when he awakens to \"smell the functions\" to evening when he seeks the best seat in the house at a local Tandoori restaurant. Although there are lots of mathematical formulae, the author explains how to use them in practical ways, such as calculating lost productivity due to sending email, texts and tweets, using integrals to estimate train wait times, and explaining the commonalities shared by your retirement income and traffic. Written in a bright conversational tone, this book wonderfully integrates calculus into everyday life. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/14011551327_1942859d53_m.jpg\" width=\"215\" height=\"240\" /> Count Like an Egyptian: A Hands-on Introduction to Ancient Mathematics by David Reimer [Princeton University Press, 2014; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691160122\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691160120/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691160120/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IPSAKIG/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> The mathematics of ancient Egypt was fundamentally different from our math today. Contrary to what people might think, it wasn't a primitive forerunner of modern mathematics. In fact, it can't be understood using our current computational methods. Count Like an Egyptian provides a fun, hands-on introduction to the intuitive and often-surprising art of ancient Egyptian math. David Reimer guides you step-by-step through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. He even shows you how fractions and decimals may have been calculated -- they technically didn't exist in the land of the pharaohs. You'll be counting like an Egyptian in no time, and along the way you'll learn firsthand how mathematics is an expression of the culture that uses it, and why there's more to math than rote memorization and bewildering abstraction.<br />Reimer takes you on a lively and entertaining tour of the ancient Egyptian world, providing rich historical details and amusing anecdotes as he presents a host of mathematical problems drawn from different eras of the Egyptian past. Each of these problems is like a tantalizing puzzle, often with a beautiful and elegant solution. As you solve them, you'll be immersed in many facets of Egyptian life, from hieroglyphs and pyramid building to agriculture, religion, and even bread baking and beer brewing.<br />Fully illustrated in color throughout, Count Like an Egyptian also teaches you some Babylonian computation -- the precursor to our modern system -- and compares ancient Egyptian mathematics to today's math, letting you decide for yourself which is better.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Why bother learning about Egyptian arithmetic? The author argues:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There are a number of reasons to learn Egyptian mathematics. Puzzle lovers will find it fun and challenging. History lovers will gain insight into the Egyptian mind-set. However, I believe the most important reason to study Egyptian mathematics is because it is so different. We're taught throughout our entire education that math simply is. We learn laws and memorize steps, never questioning what is laid out before us, for if math is \"fact,\" how could mathematics be wrong? When you're exposed to a different system, you're forced to reconsider the immutability of \"the math.\" [...] </p><p>The joy of mathematics has to be beaten out of us by endless drills and subjugation to seemingly arbitrary rules. Perhaps by starting over, this time with Egyptian mathematics, you'll get a fresh chance to revive some of the delight you felt as a child. It's time to get back in touch with the math nerd in us all. (pp. ix-x)</p></blockquote><p>An interesting combination of history, ancient literature and mythology, arithmetic puzzles and mathematics, and lavishly illustrated with numerous colour diagrams, this engaging book is unusual, thought-provoking and just plain fun to read. </p><p>What book(s) are you reading?

But when the swallows returned to their familiar nest sites a few weeks ago, they were undeterred by this peculiar impediment: they quickly learned how to open the doors by flying in front of the infrared motion detector, as you see in this video:</p><p>Reading on a mobile device? Here's the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/gs6n4XKApqc\">video link</a>. </p><p>\"Who knew they would figure out how to open [the doors]!\" exclaimed Joanne McGachie, <a href=\"http://www.uvic.ca/\">University of Victoria</a> communications officer, in email. </p><p>\"We don't really know how long they have been doing this\", writes Ms McGachie in email. \"Presumably just since nesting season began, perhaps a few weeks.\" </p><p>According to writer and bird biologist Dick Cannings, who works with <a href=\"http://www.bsc-eoc.org/\">Bird Studies Canada</a>, the migrating swallows probably spontaneously learned how to open these doors upon returning to their previous nest site, after trying to get in by flying back and forth in front of the doors.</p><p>\"That flying back and forth obviously triggers the motion sensor to open the doors and that would be quickly reinforced each time they tried to enter\", writes Mr Cannings. \"Probably straight-up operant conditioning.\"</p><p>According to Ann Nightingale, former president and current volunteer with the <a href=\"http://rpbo.org/\">Rocky Point Bird Observatory</a> in Victoria, swallows have nested in the parkade for more than two decades. </p><p>\"They really do go right up to the sensor and call\", writes Ms Nightingale in email, after watching these birds a few days ago. \"Although one bird can trigger [the door], it opens faster if there are two or three birds fluttering in front of the sensor. When the door opens, usually a few other birds fly through as well.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes it takes the birds several passes before they get into the right position to trigger the sensors\", writes Ms McGachie in email. </p><p>Despite the fact that the other end of the parkade is open, the swallows prefer to use their usual entrance, where the automatic doors are now located. And although there are some gaps in the steel screen around the plumbing pipes near the doors, the birds still choose to open the doors instead of squeezing through those permanent (albeit smaller) openings. </p><p>The determined parent birds don't (yet) appear to have any chicks. </p><p>\"It appears that the birds are still in the nest building and brooding stages -- it doesn't look like any chicks have hatched yet\", writes Ms McGachie. \"I walked around the area and I would estimate there are about 10 nests -- some are very well hidden, and only revealed by the droppings on the floor.\"</p><p>Although these birds' newfound talent is impressive, it's not unique: ornithologists and birders have long known that swallows are inventive nesters and devoted parents.<br /> <br />\"I have seen swallows do remarkable things when they pick a nest site\", writes David Fraser in email. Mr Fraser is the Unit Head for Species Conservation Science at British Columbia's <a href=\"http://www.gov.bc.ca/env/\">Ministry of Environment</a>. </p><p>Mr Fraser elaborated: \"A pair of Barn Swallows nesting in a mechanical garage at a high elevation coal mine in the Canadian Rockies near Sparwood would go in and out with the trucks. A pair of Tree Swallows nesting in an empty pipe on the back of a truck in the same mine site -- as the truck drove around the mine site servicing the diggers, the swallows would seek the truck out to feed their young. And the colony of Bank Swallows on the terminal moraine of a surging glacier in the Yukon ranks as one of the most opportunistic (and risky) nest sites I've seen.\"</p><p>Swallows are aerial insectivores, feeding on flying insects that they capture on the wing. They often live in close association with humans, building their distinctive mud nests almost exclusively on man-made structures such as barns and parking garages and under bridges. </p><p>The most familiar and widespread swallow species, the barn swallow, <em>Hirundo rustica</em>, has recently experienced worrying population declines of roughly 30 percent all across Canada for reasons that are not clear [<a href=\"http://www.avibirds.com/saps/NA/Canada/EN/Barn%20Swallow2011.pdf\">PDF</a>]. For this reason, barn swallows are currently classified as Threatened in Canada and are protected under Canada's Species at Risk Act.</p><p>\"Most of us were shocked that such a common bird has declined to levels to warrant inclusion on Canada's Species at Risk list\", writes Ms Nightingale in email. \"Let's hope that the managers of the University of Victoria's Bike Centre recognize the significance of this colony and let them go about their business in peace for a few months of the year.\"</p><p>Although it appears that all these birds are barn swallows, Ms McGachie says a few cliff swallows, <em>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</em>, may also be present in the parkade. </p><p>Unfortunately, these swallows may not be welcomed back next year. </p><p>\"We're looking at options to discourage their residency in future years\", writes Ms McGachie. \"But of course they will be left alone during this year's nesting season\".</p><p>The State of Canada's Birds 2012: <a href=\"http://www.stateofcanadasbirds.org/overview.jsp\">An Overview of National Status</a>. </p><p>Many thanks to all these fabulous people who, at a moment's notice, happily commented and shared their fascinating stories and photographs so I could share the story of this video with you:</p><p>Joanne McGachie, <a href=\"http://www.uvic.ca/\">University of Victoria</a> communications officer [emails; 27 &amp; 28 May 2014]<br /><a href=\"http://dickcannings.com\">Dick Cannings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bsc-eoc.org/\">Bird Studies Canada</a> biologist [email; 28 May 2014]<br />Ann Nightingale, former president and current volunteer with <a href=\"http://rpbo.org/\">Rocky Point Bird Observatory</a> in Victoria [emails; 29 May 2014]<br />Bob Reese, birder and wildlife photographer [emails; 29 &amp; 30 May 2014]<br />David Fraser, Unit Head for Species Conservation Science at British Columbia's <a href=\"http://www.gov.bc.ca/env/\">Ministry of Environment</a> [emails; 29 May 2014]</p><p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p><p>When she's not out birding, GrrlScientist can also be found here: <a href=\"http://www.scilogs.com/maniraptora/\">Maniraptora</a>.
