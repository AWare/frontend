But I'm more interested in two of its more specific boasts: its growing reputation as a gourmet hotspot – where slow-cooked, traditional Southern food is experiencing a revival – and the fact that it was voted Sexiest City in America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. What more incentive does a greedy single girl need to head down south?</p><p>Before I've had a chance to size up the local talent, I am seduced by the prettiness of the genteel port city itself. Founded by the English in 1670, it has picturesque streets lined with palm trees and original, old-timey gas lamps, in front of pastel-painted townhouses with pillars and porches, just begging for a languid afternoon spent lounging with a mint julep. Still so low-rise is the perfectly preserved city that a cruise liner parked in the harbour looms over the rooftops and spires like an ocean-going Godzilla.</p><p>My first pit stop is at a tiny diner, the Dixie Supply Bakery &amp; Café (<a href=\"http://www.dixiecafecharleston.com/\" title=\"\">dixiecafecharleston.com</a>) at 62 State Street. It's only open for breakfast and lunch, and most of the menu hovers around the $5 mark. Famed throughout the state for its tomato pie  – flavour-packed tomatoes layered with cheese, garlic, basil and spring onions, in a pie crust, served in slices with a hunk of homemade amber-coloured cornbread – it also specialises in the rib-sticking southern dish of shrimp and grits. Grits – a semolina-like paste, made from ground corn cooked with milk and cream –  is something of an acquired taste, which, I must confess, I have not yet acquired.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397626279'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951383662/Shops-in-Rainbow-Row-Char-001.jpg' alt='Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston.' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>While the city has a growing reputation among the foodie fraternity, and was an early adopter of the locally grown movement, its cuisine is firmly anchored in the past – from rustic barbecue joints to a rash of new fine-dining restaurants. These include the award-winning Husk (<a href=\"http://www.huskrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">huskrestaurant.com</a>) named Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appétit magazine in 2011, where nothing grown or farmed outside of the south is served.</p><p>English settlers arriving here in the 17th century made full use of the pigs left behind by the Spanish, and found its protected peninsula teeming with hundreds of species of seafood. Native Americans taught them which crops would thrive in the swampy, alligator-infested environment, namely corn, sierra beans, and squash. And the arrival of a wave of French Huguenots in the 18th century, drawn by the city's pledge of religious tolerance to all, brought desserts to the party, plus even more emphasis on pork, introducing charcuterie and cassoulets.</p><p>Less nobly, Charleston was also the centre of the slave trade in the 18th century: three out of four enslaved Africans arrived in America through this port city. But the ships which docked in the harbour brought with them not only slaves but also cooking and farming practices, introducing rice, okra – eaten fried or in soup – collard greens, aubergines and peanuts. And after more than half a century of celebrating convenience foods, the Lowcountry, as the region is known, is returning – like much of America – to its culinary roots.</p><p>Central to this is barbecue – by which the locals mainly mean pork, the definitive ingredient of southern cooking. At Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Que at 288 King Street, I round off a day of non-stop munching with tender pulled pork, slow-cooked for seven hours, and served with a cheese biscuit (which is nothing like a biscuit, and something like a scone), and collard greens, boiled with and flavoured by juicy lumps of bacon.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397626280'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951454834/Peninsula-Grills-coconut--001.jpg' alt='Peninsula Grill's coconut cake' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Peninsula Grill's coconut cake, Charleston</figcaption></figure><p>Charleston's compact size makes it one of the few US cities where it is possible to spend a few days without needing a car. But while exploring the city on foot helps you digest all that hearty southern food, it also means you may end up walking past Kaminsky's Baking Company (<a href=\"http://www.kaminskys.com/\" title=\"\">kaminskys.com</a>) on N Market Street, famed for its desserts and, dangerously, open until 2am. Just as perilous is Market Street Sweets up the road, with its lip-smacking pralines, peanut brittle and bear-claw caramels. A uniformed temptress calls \"Free samples\" from the doorway, like the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Next door, the Peninsula Grill (<a href=\"http://peninsulagrill.com\" title=\"\">peninsulagrill.com</a>) serves its celebrated, sensual coconut cake in 1lb slabs, for sharing.</p><p>As I stagger home, trying to dodge the sweet treats, I realise, a little too late, that I have assiduously road-tested the cuisine, but not surveyed the city's sexiness. But with my mind now firmly on finding something with a stretchy waistband, the men of Charleston will just have to wait for another, less gluttonous, day.</p><p><em>• Flights to Charleston were provided by US Airways (</em><a href=\"http://www.usairways.com\" title=\"\"><em>usairways.com</em></a><em>), which flies from Gatwick to Charleston, via Charlotte, North Carolina, from £555 return.

You can still visit the site of this pivotal moment in American history: <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/inde/index.htm\" title=\"\">Independence Hall</a>, a colonial building in the Old City neighbourhood, where Benjamin Franklin impersonators direct chattering tour groups, and carriage-hitched horses clickety-clack down the cobblestoned streets. It is the second most interesting thing in this handsomely preserved district. The first is a restaurant called <a href=\"http://www.forkrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Fork</strong></a>.</p><p>Businesses like Fork jump-started the area's renaissance. Many of us who grew up in Philadelphia remember the Old City of the not-too-distant past, when derelict buildings formed a coal necklace around the city's historical gems. But Fork – a light-filled, amber enclave with high ceilings and an open kitchen – changed how Philadelphians dined when it opened in 1997. It is doing so again, with a new chef, Eli Kulp, who is currently cooking some of the city's most fascinating food.</p><p>Kulp infuses gnudi (gnocchi made from ricotta cheese and a little bit of flour) with lavender, turns whole Muscovy ducks into feasts worthy of a Peking dynasty, and bakes incredible sponge-like, squid-ink bread that looks like something you'd find while scuba diving in the Seychelles. His big goal this year is to start a snail farm, but first he'll replace Fork's adjacent grocery with High Street on Market, a cafe serving gutsy sandwiches by day and hyper-creative dinners at night.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417848090'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379430499118/Vernick-Food--Drink-phill-001.jpg' alt='Vernick Food & Drink, philly' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vernick Food + Drink</figcaption></figure><p>Formerly the chef of the trendsetting Torrisi Italian Specialties in Manhattan, Kulp is part of a recent wave of acclaimed chefs who've moved from New York to start a new life in the city that has long lived in the Big Apple's shadow.

These are places where you might bump into Michael Solomonov, chef of the sterling Israeli restaurant <a href=\"http://www.zahavrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Zahav</strong></a>). The Vietnamese community has made the strongest and most delicious mark on the local food scene since the Italians of the 1920s.</p><p>Thousands traded southern Italy for South Philly, and established businesses along 9th Street (now known as the Italian Market) and Passyunk Avenue (always known as \"Pa-shunk\" Avenue) in the early 1900s. Some linger on the latter: pungent delis such as <strong>Mancuso's</strong> (1902 East Passyunk Avenue), where mozzarella balls bob in bins of cloudy saltwater, and <a href=\"http://www.marrasone.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Marra's</strong></a>, whose 90-year-old pizza ovens are said to be built with bricks of Vesuvian stone.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417848092'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379430750181/Buratta-at-Le-Virtu--001.jpg' alt='Buratta at Le Virtu\r' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Burrata at Le Virtu\r\n</figcaption></figure><p>Today, the Avenue is less spaghetti and more taccozzelle and 'nduja, thanks to enterprising indie restaurants like <a href=\"http://www.levirtu.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Le Virtu</strong></a>, while the gelato, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.capogirogelato.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Capogiro</strong></a>, comes in flavours like Dark &amp; Stormy and Saigon cinnamon.</p><p>On the north side of town, near the Delaware river, the Irish pubs and Polish clubs of close-knit Fishtown and Port Richmond now co-exist with craft-beer oases like <a href=\"http://memphistaproom.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Memphis Taproom</strong></a> and cantinas like <a href=\"http://www.locopez.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Loco Pez</strong></a>, beloved by residents for its frequent dollar-taco nights.</p><p>Recover at <a href=\"http://www.mercercafephilly.com/Mercer_Cafe_Philly/Home.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Mercer cafe</strong></a>, a sunny luncheonette that makes Philly's butteryest cream-chipped beef, a stick-to-your-ribs breakfast of creamy beef gravy heaped over toast.

Miers, the chef behind Wahaca, heads to Los Angeles to find inspiration in the city's vibrant street-food scene – scroll to the end of the article for her pork belly recipe","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T02:11:27Z","latitude":34.1157564,"body":"<p>Thomasina Miers stands on a&nbsp;sunny petrol station forecourt in Highland Park, a neighbourhood to the northeast of Los Angeles, enthusiastically eating a marinated beef-tongue taco. \"It's so delicious,\" she says through a&nbsp;mouthful of corn tortilla, coriander and tomatillo salsa.</p><p>This low-rise residential area, an hour and a world away from the Walk of Fame, bristles with signs for cheap loans and fast food. It is not on any tourist map. Star-tour buses don't pull up round here. But rather than celebrities, we're looking for Mexican street-food trucks, picking out their vivid orange, blue and pink awnings or distinctive fin-shaped roof vents from among the stucco-covered houses, corner shops and drive-throughs.  At the La Estrella and El Pique trucks, we found what we crave. We order more&nbsp;tacos, a&nbsp;beef torta (sandwich) and a&nbsp;buttery hot quesadilla and wolf them as the traffic whizzes past, juices running down our chins.</p><p>Miers, former <em>MasterChef</em> winner and co-founder of the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, is researching her next venture – a&nbsp;two-year pop-up restaurant opening next month on London's South Bank with a street-food menu. She's here because there are 11 million Mexican-Americans living in California, making up 30% of the population.</p><p>\"LA has such a huge Mexican population,\" she says. \"In terms of food trends, America, and particularly California, is often five to 10 years ahead of the UK, so it is interesting to see where they're at, particularly with Mexican, which you can find here as easily as getting a hamburger.\"</p><p>Angelenos also have more than 100 years of Mexican street-food history – the arrival and popularity of horse-drawn tamale carts caused the same kind of bureaucratic angst in the 1880s as the influx of taco trucks has done in the past couple of years – so residents have exacting standards. They want rich, slow-cooked sauces, chillies of every hue and heat, soft corn or wheat tortillas piled with meaty fillings, and they want them day and night. There are hundreds of hole-in-the-wall taco stands and trucks to keep them happy.</p><p>As we work our way round the best of them, Miers grins from ear to ear. Her interest in Mexican food was piqued when she was in her early 20s and ran a bar in Mexico City. She came home to find she couldn't get authentic Mexican anywhere in the UK and so resolved to open her own casual restaurant. Six years and five Wahacas later, the hunch she and her business partner Mark Selby had about the gap in the market has been proved right and her obsession with Mexico's food has only grown. Yuca's is one of LA's oldest street-food joints – a small shed and plastic awning next to a car park – and she can't help but order almost every&nbsp;dish, while Selby tries to keep things in control.</p><p>\"I'm on belt hook three at the moment,\" he says ruefully, \"and I'd like to stay that way.\" Ignoring him, Miers adds a plate of carne asada tacos (grilled beef) to a&nbsp;conchinita pibil (Yucatan-style pork) and machaca (shredded beef) tacos, pickled jalapeño peppers, and a&nbsp;chile verde bean and cheese burrito. This  is their first lunch of six today.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390571954'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/5/23/1337783542686/Thomasina-Miers-eating-to-008.jpg' alt='Thomasina Miers eating tongue tacos from La Estrella food truck' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thomasina Miers eating tongue tacos from La Estrella food truck</figcaption></figure><p>Our tour continues to take us to corners of Los Angeles most tourists would miss. We visit Olvera Street in Downtown and eat $3 rolled-up beef taquitos with warm avocado sauce from Cielito Lindo. We hit Las Glorias del Buen Comer in Silver Lake – home to an impressive collection of plastic floristry – for creamy shrimp enchiladas in  a green coriander sauce; chilaquiles made with fried stale tortillas,  salsa and scrambled egg; and huge poblano chillies stuffed with soft white cheese.</p><p>At Grand Central Market we watch tripe being packed into split gorditas, deep-fried maize-dough pockets, and are given carnitas (pork tacos) to try by a group of men leaning on a&nbsp;red Formica lunch counter, swigging coke out of huge old glass bottles. The sawdust-covered walkways lead to stalls selling jar after jar of dried chillies and piles of tomatillos (a&nbsp;fruit resembling a green tomato) and jicama, which look like turnips and taste like water chestnut.</p><p>The best dishes of the day are served in Guisado's, a small, plain shop in Boyle Heights, a Latino neighbourhood east of Downtown. After we order most of his menu, owner Armando de la Torre takes us to the grocery shop next door where, incongruously, he gets his corn cooked, skinned, hoppered and ground, and then hand-makes it into tortillas or adds lard to make masa for tamales (stuffed steamed breads)  or conchas (sweet pastries).</p><p>His daughter Natalie loads our table with cardboard plates of tacos topped with tinga de pollo (spiced shredded chicken), skirt steak simmered in pimento sauce, fiery grilled fish with chilli diablo, and a&nbsp;chicken mole (a traditional sauce that takes at least a day to make properly). We try chicharron, made with black beans and slow-cooked pork scratchings. It's much more appetising than it sounds: the fatty pork rinds render down and what's left is melt-in-the-mouth pigginess.</p><p>Only one dish defeats us: a chilli taco with habanero ketchup so spicy that it leaves anyone who tastes it red-faced and gasping. Legend has it one visitor managed four in one go. \"Eat one, get another free!\" says Armando cheerfully as he pours us a shot each of smooth tequila royale reposado to sip. We are, finally, sated.</p><p>Next day, the main aim is to find  a Kogi truck. Kogi shot to local and then national fame in 2008 when the first of a fleet of five vans popped up selling a surprisingly successful blend of Korean and Mexican food – a&nbsp;signature dish is soy-marinated short rib tacos with coriander and cabbage – and has since spawned dozens of imitators. Its trucks change location up to three times daily and can only be located via Twitter, where Kogi has 96,000 followers; in 2010 its&nbsp;head chef, Roy Choi, was named best new chef in the US by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> magazine – quite an accolade for a kitchen the size of a caravan.</p><p>We find the truck (and its lengthy queue) outside an office block next to the Fox studios in Century City and feast on kimchi quesadillas, which are sweet, gingery cheese and pickled cabbage tortilla sandwiches, and Kogi sliders: miniature brioche buns with Korean bulgogi-marinated short-rib burgers. We finish the meal with  an entirely unnecessary and ridiculously moreish home-made chocolate bar with squidgy chilli salt caramel and peanuts.</p><p>\"Coming here, you can see authentic Mexican cooking and lots of its famous street food, but you can also see where else this food can go,\" says Miers. \"This is some of the most exciting, innovative food we've tried. This trip is giving me masses of ideas to work with!\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390571955'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/5/23/1337783615938/Santa-Monica-beach-the-us-008.jpg' alt='Santa Monica beach, the usual pull for Los Angeles tourists' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Santa Monica beach, the usual pull for Los Angeles tourists</figcaption></figure><p>Half an hour later we pull up at Komodo, another Korean-Mexican-Asian-Californian truck, where somehow find room in our stomachs to try delicate fish and grape tacos with pickled cucumber and sesame oil and pork meatballs that are charred and crisp on the outside and pink and lightly spiced inside. Although they're incredibly tasty, even Miers agrees that ordering two portions of truffled potato fries was a mistake; we attempt to cleanse our palates with lychee juice.</p><p>Our final stop of the day is Mariscos Chente, a seafood restaurant where we sample drunken shrimp and chipotle prawns and drink vast micheladas – beer mixed with Clamato (clam and tomato) juice and lime, served in a&nbsp;chilli-salt rimmed glass. Then it's back to the hotel, where we swim lengths of the pool in a&nbsp;bid to make room for dinner.</p><p>Oddly, Los Angeles's very high-end Mexican restaurants don't seem to deliver food that's as exciting as the city's street food. In the evenings we try two of the best: Border Grill, founded by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, and Red O, which belongs to Rick Bayless. These three chefs have done more than anyone to popularise and legitimise Mexican food in America. But although the meals were fine, it was as though the punchy mouthfuls of flavour we'd been ploughing through all day didn't taste the same inside, off pieces of fine china and eaten with cutlery; they didn't give us the same intense sense of the place and its inhabitants as the foods they cook and eat every day could. However good a&nbsp;posh restaurant's heirloom tomato tostadito or yellowtail ceviche might be, they couldn't beat those tongue tacos eaten in the roar of the traffic.<br />• <em>Thomasina Miers' new recipe book </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781444722390\" title=\"\">Wahaca – Mexican Food at Home </a><em>is out next month</em></p><h2>Essentials</h2><p>Rebecca Seal's accommodation was provided by the W Hotel Hollywood (<a href=\"http://www.whotels.starwoodhotels.com\">whotels.starwoodhotels.com</a>) and she flew to LA with British Airways (<a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">ba.com</a>)</p><h2>Food stops</h2><p><strong>La Estrella and  El Pique</strong><br />Corner of York and Avenue 54, Highland Park, CA 90042 <br /><strong>Yuca's</strong><br />2056 Hillhurst Avenue, Los Feliz, CA 90027 (001 323 662 1214)<br /><strong>Cielito Lindo</strong><br />E-23 Olvera Street, CA 90012 (001 213 687 4391; <br /><a href=\"http://www.cielitolindo.org\">cielitolindo.org</a>)<br /><strong>Las Glorias del Buen </strong><br />Comer 620 Silver Lake Boulevard, Silver Lake, CA 90026 (001 213 484 9090)<br /><strong>Grand Central Market</strong><br />317 South Broadway, Downtown, CA 90013 (<a href=\"http://www.grandcentral square.com\">grandcentral square.com</a>)<br /><strong>Guisado's</strong><br />2100 East Cesar Chavez Avenue, Boyle Heights, CA 90033<br /><strong>Kogi</strong><br />Check @KOGIBBQ for daily locations<br /><strong>Komodo</strong> <br /><a href=\"http://www.Komodofood.com\">Komodofood.com</a> <br />for daily locations<br /><strong>Mariscos Chente</strong><br />4532 South Centinela Avenue, Culver City, CA 90066 (001 310 390 9241)<br /><strong>Border Grill</strong><br />445 South Figueroa Street, Downtown, CA 90071 (001 213 486 5171)<br /><strong>Red O</strong><br />8155 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, CA 90046 (001 323 655 5009; <a href=\"http://www.redorestaurant.com\">redorestaurant.com</a>)</p><h2>Thomasina Miers's pork belly carnitas</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390571956'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/5/23/1337783457747/Pork-Carnitas-001.jpg' alt='Pork Carnitas' width='356' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Carnitas is one of the most mouth-watering dishes in the Mexican repertoire: succulent chunks of pork that are slowly braised in their own fat, just like duck confit </strong></p><p>Serves 6–8 <br />pork belly boned<br />lard 500g <br />bay leaves 2<br />garlic 5 cloves, bashed<br />oranges 2, sliced<br />peppercorns 1 tsp <br />cola drink 500ml<br />thyme a handful of sprigs<br />sea salt</p><p><strong>How to do it</strong><br />Preheat the oven to 130C/gas mark 1.

Meals are squeezed into the temporal crawlspaces between meetings and shifts. Restaurants lurk in any corner they can find, so food crops up in the oddest places as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/mar/06/newyork.travelfoodanddrink\">Benji Lanyado</a> found out on his last visit to New York. </p><p>But culinary life isn't confined to restaurants. Harried commuters rushing to board a train scarf down a bite from all manner of meals-on-wheels: aluminum street food carts, mail trucks converted into kitchens, humble stainless steel trailers. This isn't only a New York thing, of course. But this is: within the space of a few blocks, there's a breadth and density of street food from nearly every continent and a passion for its refinement. For under $10, an atlas of food can be yours. </p><p>Though many chefs begin their careers cooking in the sidewalk streetcart, the successful ones rarely stay there. We've already discovered the best <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2007/oct/03/travelnews.newyork\">street food</a> on the street, but now let's delve indoors to where the hasty cuisine of carts has been stabilised and blossomed in the comforts of a kitchen. </p><h2>Punjabi</h2><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-333573247'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/04/16/punjabi.jpg' alt='Punjabi restaurant, New York' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Tucked into a basement on East 1st St, this desi vegetarian food counter, is easy to find - just look for the line of idling and parked yellow cabs outside. Long opening hours and cheap food make it a favourite among cab drivers getting off their shifts as well as impecunious East Villagers. The tiny store sells everything from samosa to lentils and rice for just over $3, to remixes  of Eminem tinged with bhangra.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Punjabi: 114 East 1st St, +1 212 533 9048</p><h2>Otafuku</h2><p>A few blocks north and a subcontinent away, Otafuku serves takoyaki — the ultimate Japanese street food. Takoyaki look like profiteroles but are baked balls of wheat batter and octopus cooked on a griddle. The two-man team behind the sliver-thin counter also make griddled cabbage pancakes called okonomiyaki. The takoyaki themselves come six to a $5 order, topped with fish shavings (benito flakes), and a barbecue-like sauce. The okonomiyaki come with corn, pork or chicken. They're best eaten in the summer time on the bench outside or across Stuyvesant Street on the steps of the Hebrew Technical Institute's Lucas Steinam School For Metal Working. </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Otafuku: 236, E. 9th Street, New York, +1 212 353 8503</p><h2>Shachi's Venezuelan Restaurant </h2><p>Moving east into Brooklyn, the various ethnic enclaves offer up their own takes on the street foods of their calles and ulicas (streets). At the very base of the Williamsburg bridge, as Brooklyn fans into Orthodox Jews to the south and Latinos to the north, Shachi's Venezuelan Restaurant colonises a storefront in between a bank and a cheque cashing joint.  The restaurant specialises in arepas, traditional cornflour pockets stuffed with everything from plantains and stewed steak to chicken salad. The pabellon is a compact package of juicy stewed meat, beans, queso blanco, sweet plantains tucked together under the protection of the crisp arepa crust.  Lunch specials include an arepa and a fresh mango juice for $7. </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Shachi's: 197 Havermeyer St, Brooklyn , +1 718 388 8884</p><h2>Lomzynianka</h2><p>Walking north on Bedford past McCarren Park, the neighbourhood morphs from Latino to hipster to, finally, Polish.  Once you've hit Lomzynianka on Manhattan Avenue, you'll swear you've entered Warsaw. The restaurant is proud home to the $3 order of pierogi and the $1 cup of borscht. The slosh of Polish consonants of Greenpoint's large Polish community serves as sonic accompaniment in the kitschy dining room to the hearty fare and the cheap beer. </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> <a href=\"http://www.lomzynianka.com\">Lomzynianka</a>, 646 Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn, +1 718 389 9439</p><h2>Streecha</h2><p>If, however, you're a real connoisseur of Eastern European cuisine, and it's varenyky dumplings you prefer instead of pierogi dumplings, head back into Manhattan to a tiny East village basement a block away from the Ukranian Museum of New York City. Streecha is Ukrainian for meeting hall and it's only open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The thousands of potato dumplings and gallons of borscht are made by a close-knit community of Ukrainian septuagenarian parishioners from the Catholic Church next door. A steaming plate of varenyky, a cup of silky vinegary borscht and a slice of traditionalapple cake will cost you less than five dollars.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Stricha: 24 E. 7th Street, New York, NY</p>","headline":"NY street food without the street","trailText":"<p>New York's multicultural street food is unrivalled - and the most successful vendors take their wares and set up shop. <strong>Joshua Stein</strong> brings you some of the tastiest</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/04/16/NYStreetFood1.jpg","wordcount":"706","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"333555381","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Joshua Stein","internalPageCode":"744988","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2008-04-18T09:56:58Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/16/travelfoodanddrink.newyork","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/apr/16/travelfoodanddrink.newyork","tags":[{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/travelfoodanddrink","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/travelfoodanddrink","references":[]},{"id":"travel/newyork","webTitle":"New York","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/newyork","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/newyork","references":[]},{"id":"travel/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/usa","references":[]},{"id":"travel/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/restaurants","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/restaurants","references":[]},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/travel","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/travel","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/restaurants","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/restaurants","references":[]},{"id":"profile/joshuastein","webTitle":"Joshua Stein","r2ContributorId":"28227","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/24/joshua_stein_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Joshua David Stein covers the Eastern Seaboard of the United States for the Guardian.

Charleston and New Orleans would be much more fruitful for my purposes, she says.</p><p>This isn't the first baffled response I've had since planning my food tour of \"Music City\", which, with its country music heritage, baloney-touting honky-tonk bars and landlocked location, has never been known as one of the US's culinary meccas.</p><p>Until now, that is. Because there's a new energy to Nashville's food and drink scene that has been getting it noticed lately. It's being driven by a crew of home-grown entrepreneurs and creatives drawn to the city's reinvigorated music scene (thank you Jack White) and laid-back lifestyle. It is also driven by a newfound interest in southern barbecue and soul food – currently starring on menus from New York to London – with food scenesters raving about collard greens, pulled pork, chicken and grits.</p><p>Two days later I'm sitting at the wide wooden counter at The Catbird Seat (1711 Division Street, +1 615 810 8200, <a href=\"http://www.thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com</a>), Nashville's hottest culinary destination, watching two chefs assemble vivid, artful dishes with a mixture of balletic synchronicity and rock'n'roll swagger. The Catbird Seat is an open-kitchen restaurant, where Erik Anderson and Josh Habiger cook in front of their 36 guests, personally delivering their creative, seasonal seven-course set menus ($100).</p><p>The two chefs have CVs spanning some of the world's best restaurants: <a href=\"http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Alinea</a> in Chicago, London's <a href=\"http://www.stjohnrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">St John</a>, <a href=\"http://noma.dk/\" title=\"\">Noma</a> in Copenhagen and California's <a href=\"http://www.frenchlaundry.com/\" title=\"\">French Laundry</a>. That's some form, and it's palpable – with both Anderson and Habiger just named Best New Chefs 2012 by US-based Food &amp; Wine magazine.</p><p>\"To start, these are your snacks,\" says Anderson, stretching out a tattooed arm and placing a long plate in front of me. \"Hot chicken skin with dill, spice and Wonder Bread puree; corn bread cooked in duck fat with bacon cream, and a Northern Cross oyster with yuzu and cucumber.\"</p><p>What follows is a procession of inventive, exciting modern American dishes that meld traditional and cutting-edge techniques and incorporate southern flourishes. Among them is steak tartare with Arctic char roe, caper \"butts\" and chive flowers; grilled, braised pork belly doused in a \"ramp vichyssoise\" made from the intense wild garlic that grows so ubiquitously here; and, my favourite, a dish of wood pigeon with white asparagus tips and hay-infused caramelised yoghurt.</p><p>When I meet the chefs the next day at their favourite coffee shop –  Fido (1812 21st Avenue South, +1 615 777 3436, <a href=\"http://bongojava.com/fido.php\" title=\"\">bongojava.com/fido.php</a>) in the trendy Hillsboro Village neighbourhood, with burgers from $9 – they look more like members of the bands Anderson managed in a former life than exponents of high gastronomy, with their checked shirts, messy hair and breakfast tacos. It's exactly this laid-back approach that defines the Nashville food scene.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-392967296'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/7/4/1341415851847/Princes-Hot-Chicken-Shack-001.jpg' alt='Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville' width='460' height='253' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville</figcaption></figure><p>\"I think that being here allows us to have a lot more fun and keep it unpretentious,\" says Habiger. \"You can go to Prince's [Hot Chicken Shack], or <a href=\"http://www.monellstn.com/ndininginfo.html\" title=\"\">Monell's</a> and sit at a family-style restaurant with a bunch of people you don't know and eat some amazing country food. It's not like New York City, where it's a race to get stars.\"</p><p>Prince's Hot Chicken Shack (123 Ewing Dr # 3, +1 615 226 9442) is a local institution that's been serving its scorchingly spicy southern fried chicken (from $4) in the same location on the rundown outskirts of the city for 27 years. The chicken skin snack from the night before was inspired by this classic.</p><p>\"It's a Nashville staple, so we do a riff on that so it's kind of familiar to people. They sit down for a meal and they're getting something that's just a tiny bit recognisable but really different as well,\" says Anderson, whose favourite haunt is another restaurant that enjoys updating southern traditions. City House in Germantown (1222 4th Avenue North, +1 615 736 5838, <a href=\"http://cityhousenashville.com/\" title=\"\">cityhousenashville.com</a>) is a buzzing, warehouse-style eatery where chef Tandy Wilson serves Italian-meets-southern sharing plates such as crispy pizza topped with \"belly ham\" ($13), and catfish (another Nashville stalwart, $22) with a mustard, onion, horseradish and lemon marmalade \"Jezebel\" sauce.</p><p>Local lad Wilson, who opened City House five years ago, is often cited as having sparked the city's food revolution with his new take on local flavours. \"Lots of people had married French food and southern, and I found those similarities with Italian food, which, like the food here, is about letting the ingredients speak for themselves,\" he says. \"A lot of our nation's food comes from European and African influences but you see more things that are uniquely American in the south than anywhere else. Catfish is extremely southern, and corn bread we don't mess with – it's done in a very specific manner, in a large skillet, with lard and quality buttermilk. That's as southern as it gets.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-392967297'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/7/4/1341415781428/Dessert-at-The-Capitol-Gr-001.jpg' alt='Dessert at The Capitol Grille in Nashville' width='460' height='514' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dessert at The Capitol Grille in Nashville</figcaption></figure><p>It's this notion of indigenous foods that inspires the progressive southern cooking of chef Tyler Brown at the city's Capitol Grille in the Hermitage Hotel (231 6th Avenue North, +1 615 244 3121, <a href=\"http://www.capitolgrillenashville.com\" title=\"\">capitolgrillenashville.com</a>, daily specials $14). I meet Brown at a 65-acre farm four miles from his downtown kitchen, where the produce obsessive grows heritage vegetables, keeps bees and raises cattle.</p><p>\"We wanted to grow in the old style,\" he says from under a glorious handlebar moustache. \"Different field peas that people have been growing in their families for years, heirloom corn, old varieties with a story to them …\"</p><p>At the restaurant he uses these ingredients to reimagine traditional recipes such as \"dirty farro\", a take on Louisiana \"dirty rice\" made with farro (spelt grains)  spices, carrots, country ham and sweet, juicy clams.</p><p>Looking back while moving forward seems to be rather a theme here. Proper old-fashioned sodas with house-made syrups, evil malted shakes and ridiculously tasty draught root beer are the thing at The Pharmacy (731 Mcferrin Ave, +1 615 712 9517, <a href=\"http://www.thepharmacynashville.com\" title=\"\">thepharmacynashville.com</a>, burgers from $7) in the up-and-coming East Nashville neighbourhood.</p><p>Over the road at Holland House (935 West Eastland Avenue, +1 615 262 4190, <a href=\"http://www.hollandhousebarandrefuge.com\" title=\"\">hollandhousebarandrefuge.com</a>, mains from around $20) a prohibition-style \"refuge\", the barmen sport tweed waistcoats and shake creative cocktails amid vintage chandeliers and reclaimed furniture.  This is where 30-year-old head chef Kristin Beringson crafts what she calls \"simple farm-to-table food with a southern twist\". Her beautifully presented dishes include pulled pork flatbread with local apple and red cabbage-cranberry slaw, and sea bass with chorizo-saffron broth and skillet cornbread. \"Nashville is catching up with places such as Portland and New York. It's exciting, and it's really fun to be in the middle of all this.\"</p><p>My thoughts exactly – and that's just one of many reasons why you should visit \"Nash Vegas\".</p><p><em>• Travelbag (0871 703 4240, </em><a href=\"http://www.travelbag.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>travelbag.co.uk</em></a><em>) provided the trip.

Mark Dancey</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dear Mexican …</strong></p><p><strong>I'm a Brit who's travelling to New Mexico and Texas this summer. We love our Tex-Mex in England – all that chilli and yellow cheese! So where can I get the good stuff?</strong><br /><em>The Boy with the Nachos in His Side</em></p><p>You're not going to find much chilli and yellow cheese in New Mexico (or even in Texas – the two states have about as much in common as Doctor Who and Star Wars). New Mexico is most famous for its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_chile\" title=\"\">hatch chillies</a>: fulsome, fleshy peppers from the southern part of the \"Land of Enchantment\" that the locals either eat whole, or grill and put inside cheeseburgers – the <a href=\"http://lotaburger.com/\" title=\"\">Blake's Lotaburger</a> chain is famous for its version – or turn into a stew. New Mexico's Mexican food is unique because it dates back to the days of the Spanish conquistadors, back when you Brits were still eating each other at Jamestown.</p><p>You should think of Texas, meanwhile, as a large, unwieldy country of countries with edible brimstone (salsa) the sole unifier. Since you want to visit New Mexico as well, you'll probably only be able to travel via El Paso – and stop at Chico's Tacos (5305 Montana Avenue, +1 915 772 7777, no website) and order the rolled tacos – what we call taquitos.</p><p>In case you travel elsewhere in Texas, here's a brief Tex-Mex primer: in San Antonio, the natives eat puffy tacos, which look like a Cornish pasty inflated to its golden, crispy extreme. South Texas is famous for its <em>barbacoa</em> (a slow-roasted cow's head) and <em>cabrito</em> (slow-roasted kid – as in the goat, not a small child). Texas also is the land of nachos, so do me a favour, Boy, remind them that they stole the idea of vile yellow goop poured over crunchy trash from your Welsh rarebit.</p><p><strong>Do we have authentic Mexican food in the UK?</strong><br /><em>Finito Benito's</em></p><p>Yes, and no. My friends who have travelled across the pond always return with horror stories about the Mexican food there, and all agree with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/04/mexico-top-gear\" title=\"\">the Top Gear <em>pendejos</em></a> – Mexican food in Britain <em>is</em> refried sick. But it's still Mexican food. See, all tacos are created equal but some tacos are more equal than others. When people ask about \"authentic\" food, they mean regional Mexican specialities that haven't achieved widespread popularity. A good place to try these dishes in the UK is at one of <a href=\"http://wahaca.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wahaca</a>'s eight London restaurants. Its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal\" title=\"\"><em>mescal</em></a> comes from Mexico's rural regions, <em>tinga</em> is a chicken preparation from Mexico City, and <em>pibil</em> (slow-roasted pork) is the pride and joy of the Yucatan.</p><p><strong>If you could only have one Mexican meal in Texas or New Mexico, what would it be and where would you have it?</strong><br /><em>This Sporting Salsa Life </em></p><p>That's like a Mexican asking a Brit which Mr Bean bit is his favourite. Instead of directing you to the big cities, I'm throwing a rural beauty your way: Chope's Bar and Cafe in La Mesa, New Mexico (16145 New Mexico 28, +1 575 233 3420). It's a 40-minute drive west from El Paso but worth the trek. Chope's is a tiny restaurant selling some of the best <em>pozol</em>e (a stew made from local pork and chillis harvested from the Mesilla valley, in which La Mesa is situated) in the state, and its sister bar is right next door, a heaven for lushes of all nationalities. Make sure to end your La Mesa adventure with a pecan-based dessert, as the scenic drive you'll take goes through the largest pecan grove in the world.</p><p><strong>Ask A Mexican at themexican @</strong><a href=\"http://www.gustavoarellano.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>askamexican.net</strong></a><strong>, follow him on Twitter </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GustavoArellano\" title=\"\"><strong>@gustavoarellano</strong></a><strong> or ask a video question at </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/askamexicano\" title=\"\"><strong>youtube.com/askamexicano</strong></a></p><p>• <strong>For more information on holidays in the USA, visit </strong><a href=\"http://www.discoveramerica.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>DiscoverAmerica.com</strong></a></p>","headline":"Tex-Mex food for thought with ¡Ask a Mexican!","trailText":"<p>¡Ask a Mexican!

A stint in southern France, followed by an opportunity to study under a Michelin-starred chef from Brittany, lit a fire beneath Blackshear to start her own truck dedicated to French street food (the only one of its kind in town). The Crepe Complete – an egg sunny side up with Black Forest ham, Swiss cheese and baby arugula – is a must, but you can also have your crepe with a sweet Nutella-and-banana filling for dessert. You'll find Crepe a Diem at the Franklin Farmers Market every Saturday morning, at White's Mercantile or the <a href=\"http://www.12southfarmersmarket.com\" title=\"\">12 South Farmers Market</a> for dinner Tuesdays (4pm to 8pm) or outside the <a href=\"http://yazoobrew.com/\" title=\"\">Yazoo Brewing Company</a> on Fridays. <br />• <em>Crepe a Diem's Twitter feed </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crepeadiem\" title=\"\"><em>@crepeadiem</em></a><em>) for location updates and </em><a href=\"http://www.crepeadiem.com\" title=\"\"><em>crepeadiem.com</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Smokin Thighs</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432467762'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/5/1394037440794/Smokin-Thighs-New-Orleans-001.jpg' alt='Smokin Thighs, New Orleans\r' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>While fried chicken is the <em>pièce de résistance</em> around Nashville, Matthew Carney opted to start a food truck centered upon poultry that is smoked, not fried.

At the farmers' market at <a href=\"http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/markets/psu/\" title=\"\">Portland State University</a> (a&nbsp;typically low-key descriptor for this food-lover's heaven: sprawling and picturesque) dozens of stalls are piled high with brightly hued produce, home-baking, local-made <em>charcuterie</em>, and, of course, street food. Here we meet up with Karen Brooks, Portland's best-known (and best-loved) restaurant critic. Karen is the queen of the culinary scene. Her book, <a href=\"http://www.chroniclebooks.com/titles/the-mighty-gastropolis-portland.html\" title=\"\">The Mighty Gastropolis</a>, is the essential tool for anyone planning a visit. We'd like to explore a little further afield than the city centre pods, so which of her \"pavement gourmets\" should we hit next?</p><p>Karen's recommendation is to try&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tiffinasha.com/\" title=\"\">Tiffin&nbsp;Asha</a>, at North Beech Street, on an arty stretch&nbsp;of historic Mississippi Avenue (a rare, non-pod cart). The food is so on&nbsp;the money I'm still pining for it now. Former pastry chef Elizabeth Golay's take on&nbsp;southern Indian food is&nbsp;the stuff of&nbsp;obsession. Her pakora-fried chicken&nbsp;in the lightest, frilliest <em>dosa</em> pancake, perked up with homemade chutneys and spiked by \"gunpowder\" spice mixes, is officially one of the most delicious things I've tasted, ever.</p><p>Karen also tells us not to miss the city's lauded falafel stands – it's fair to say that fried chickpeas have never been so luxurious, so revelatory. Also at her behest, we check out the coffee from microroaster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OleLatteCoffee\" title=\"\">Olé Latte</a> back on SW&nbsp;Alder; with its roster of single-origin espresso beans and \"pay-it-forward\" programme, it's a shot in the arm for a caffeine-addicted city that thinks it has seen it all.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438316298'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401373708596/Wolf--Bears-001.jpg' alt='Wolf & Bear's' width='460' height='283' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Wolf & Bear's</figcaption></figure><h2>Tweet street: using&nbsp;social&nbsp;media</h2><p>Soon we feel confident enough to strike out on our own.

As <a href=\"http://www.lesechos.fr/info/inter/020450556461-pierre-de-gasquet-nicolas-sarkozy-a-inaugure-la-diplomatie-du-hot-dog-.htm\">Les Echoes noted</a>, the restaurant \"fréquenté en son temps par Martin Luther King\".</p><p>Sadly, the only problem with Ben's Chili Bowl is that while the atmosphere is great, the food is mediocre, even by fast food standards. The signature \"chili\" is oily and very salty, and is itself mild but served at a ferociously hot temperature. <a href=\"http://clesnes.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/03/30/obama-narrete-pas-decouter-nicolas/\">Le Monde's Washington correspondent</a> summed it up pretty well: \"une institution devenue assez touristique où l'on mange des hot-dogs\".</p><p>Still, the other option for Sarkozy was lunch at the White House with noted raconteur Tim Geithner and his gang of econo-wonks. Even Ben's nuclear chili sounds good in comparison.</p><p>Ben's, though, has a hell of a backstory, as part of the neglected African-American heritage of Washington DC. It was opened in 1958 by an immigrant from Trinidad, <a href=\"http://dcist.com/2009/10/ben_ali_founder_of_bens_chili_bowl.php\">Ben Ali</a>, a dental student at nearby <a href=\"http://www.dentistry.howard.edu/\">Howard University</a>, and his wife Virginia. But the reason it's a landmark (apart from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003383.html\">sheer longevity</a>) is its role in DC's U Street corridor, once known as the \"black Broadway\". The <a href=\"http://www.benschilibowl.com/ordereze/Content/2/Summary.aspx\">restaurant's website recounts</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Top performers could be found playing sets in clubs along the corridor, as well as eating and just \"hanging out\" at Ben's. It was not uncommon to see such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Bessie Smith, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Nat King Cole, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Martin Luther King Jr or Bill Cosby at \"The Bowl.\"<br /></p></blockquote><p>Bill Cosby was a regular visitor, and for years a notice hung behind the counter reading: \"List of who eats free at Ben's: Bill Cosby. No one else\". In 2008 <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2008/12/obama-family-makes-the-eat-free-list-at-bens.html\">the sign was amended</a> to add the Obama family to the list – although when <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/01/10/obama_gets_a_half-smoke_at_ben.html\">Obama himself did visit</a>, before his presidential inauguration in 2009, he paid in full.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-361065887'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/31/bens_free.jpg' alt='Old Ben's Chili Bowl sign' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Old Ben's Chili Bowl sign. Photograph: Alicia Griffin</figcaption></figure><p>Washington was convulsed by race riots in 1968, along with many other parts of the US, in the wake of King's assassination. Ben's was one of the few businesses to stay open during the riots that devastated sections of the capital. The restaurant's website says: \"<a href=\"http://www.interchange.org/Kwameture/nytimes111698.html\">Stokely Carmichael</a> of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, which was located across the street, obtained special police permission to allow Ben's to stay open after curfew to provide food and shelter for activists, firefighters and public servants desperately trying to restore order.\"</p><p>Since then the restaurant has appeared as local colour in movies – the most recent being <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473705/\">State of Play</a> – and has turned into a stop on the Washington tourism trail as well as being a late-night fast food joint. In 2008 the Ali family opened another restuarant and bar, called <a href=\"http://www.bensnextdoor.com/ordereze/\">Next Door</a>, which is rather more up-market, in keeping with the gentrification of the U Street corridor.</p><p>The other notable event of the Sarkozy déjeuner was Carla Bruni's delight at the half-smoke sausage in her hotdog – the half-smoke being Washington DC's sole indigenous contribution to world cuisine.</p><p>What's a half-smoke? The funny thing is no one can agree on anything other than the fact that it's a Washingtonian delicacy. The Washington City Paper wrote an <a href=\"http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/561/the-missing-link\">exhaustive article on the subject</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Depending on whom you ask, the half-smoke is simply a smoked sausage. Or it's a sausage that's been smoked only halfway — whatever that could possibly mean. Or maybe it's a half-smoke because some cooks prefer to split it in half when it goes on the grill. Or its \"half\" comes from the fact that it's often made from equal portions of beef and pork. But then how do you explain all those half-smokes downtown that are advertised as all-beef?</p></blockquote><p>So, no-one knows – but whatever they are, you can buy half-smokes at every hotdog stand in the District. They taste slightly spicier than normal franks.</p><p>So if you want to avoid the crowds, and eat some decent fast food, where to go in DC? For locals the chain of choice is often the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/entre/2009-06-07-fast-food-hamburger-franchise_N.htm\">Five Guys burger bar</a>, with multiple outlets around Washington, where a custom-made burger, fries and Coke can be had for $10. The Obamas go for Five Guys burgers on a regular basis – both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8532264\">Barack</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/02/first_lady_michelle_obama_lunc.html\">Michelle</a>. The fries are excellent. And the hotdogs are pretty good too. Or there's the huge <a href=\"http://www.lauriolplaza.com/\">Lauriol Plaza</a>, a longstanding Mexican restaurant on 18th Street in Adams Morgan – a favourite of Bill Clinton's.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: My colleague Saptarshi Ray points out in comments below that I didn't mention a personal favourite fast food place: the <a href=\"http://www.welldressedburrito.com/\">Well Dressed Burrito</a>. The WDB is <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-well-dressed-burrito-washington\">very good</a> indeed – try the \"daily special\" burrito for $6.25. But because it's hard to find, hidden away down an alley off 19th St NW between M and N streets, and has short lunchtime opening hours (11.45am to 2.15pm) Monday to Friday only, it's not going to work for many tourists.

On the coast of Maine, much of the gastronomic wealth comes, of course, from the sea, including produce that old-fashioned Yankees would never think of eating, such as sea urchin roe, seaweed and sea cucumber.</p><p>The coast of Maine may be my favourite place in the world, for its rocky beauty, the character of its people, its sense of history, and its food. One of my happiest memories is of the six months I lived and worked in a house by a small harbour. The coast is big. It takes four-and-a-half hours to drive it by the fastest route, which cheats by running partly inland. Stretched out, the coastline would run for more than 3,000 miles, and that's not counting islands (see <a href=\"http://mainecoastguide.com/cruising/where.html\" title=\"\">mainecoastguide.com</a>).</p><p>The town that gives the strongest sense of coastal Maine life is <strong>Stonington</strong>, at the foot of Deer Isle, connected to the mainland by a tall, narrow bridge. Stonington has by far Maine's largest concentration of lobster boats. It's very picturesque, with limited evidence of either the good or ill effects of tourism, and it lies on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Bay\" title=\"\">Penobscot Bay</a>, which is a candidate for most beautiful bay in the world.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417901108'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379419906687/Buying-lobster-at-a-fishe-001.jpg' alt='Buying lobster at a fisherman cooperative Stonington ' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Fishermen unload their haul at Stonington, Maine's lobster capital. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>To see the bay properly, take the \"mail boat\" from Stonington to Isle au Haut, a few miles south at the edge of the bay. Then, if you're back in town early enough, you can watch the lobstermen unload their catch. From there, head to 36 Main Street and eat a lobster with the locals at the <strong>Harbor Cafe</strong> (+1 207 367 5099).</p><p>Back on the mainland, hang a left at Brooksville for the Cape Rosier peninsula. Near Harborside, lovers of organic veg will enjoy a stop at the famous <a href=\"http://www.fourseasonfarm.com/farmstand/index.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Four Seasons Farm</strong></a> (609 Weir Cove Road, fourseasonfarm.com), run by eminent gardener Eliot Coleman, to buy produce, books and artworks from the local artist collective.</p><p>To the south-west, the other side of Rockland, lies what is probably the north-east's best spot for oyster-farming, the Damariscotta river. It's really a long tidal inlet, in whose lower portion the cold water and balance of salt produces slow-growing, full-flavoured, fine-textured oysters. If you want to open them yourself, buy them at the little shop at <a href=\"http://www.oysterfarm.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Glidden Point Oyster Co</strong></a>. If you'd rather have someone else do the work, sample them at <a href=\"http://www.kingeiderspub.com\" title=\"\"><strong>King Eider's Pub</strong></a> right in Damariscotta town.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417901109'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379420451911/Bondir-Restaurant-In-Camb-001.jpg' alt='Bondir Restaurant In Cambridge' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vermont lamb at Bondir in Cambridge. Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>When I first began to eat in <strong>Boston</strong> some years ago it was a gastronomic backwater, and appeared to suffer from a strong, lingering Puritan influence. Of course, it had been known for certain foods — baked beans (which can be excellent), cod (ditto), and the incredibly old-fashioned-sounding <a href=\"http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/indian_pudding/\" title=\"\">Indian pudding</a>, which is cornmeal mush with molasses. Now Boston restaurants are totally up to date. Some of the best get their humanely raised, organically fed poultry, rabbit, pork, and other things from <a href=\"http://peteandjensbackyardbirds.com/farm-photos.htm\" title=\"\">Pete &amp; Jen's Backyard Birds</a> up the road in Concord, Massachusetts. Taste these excellent meats at <a href=\"http://bondircambridge.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bondir</strong></a>  a contemporary restaurant in Cambridge, just over the Charles river.</p><p>Cranberries, an ultra-American, originally wild fruit, are harvested at the end of September and early October. It's fascinating to see the harvested red berries floating in a flooded bog, but those berries are only for processing. For keeping, they must be harvested dry, which is done nowadays by machine. Kristine and Robert Keese of <a href=\"http://organiccranberries.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Cranberry Hill Farm</strong></a> (+1 508 888 9179, organiccranberries.com) in Plymouth, Massachusetts, became the first certified-organic cranberry growers in the US  almost 20 years ago. In season, you might catch their two-day harvest, and buy straight from the growers (call first).</p><p>The food of <strong>Philadelphia</strong>, in the shadow of New York, is underappreciated by those who haven't been. I've come to know the city and its ever-increasing number of good restaurants only as an adult. At weekends, the famous <a href=\"http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Reading Terminal Market</strong></a> is full of energy and jammed with people coming to buy from the countless purveyors, including Amish. Buy a soft Philadelphia pretzel ($2) in the market at <a href=\"http://www.millerstwist.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Miller's Twist </strong></a>.</p><p>Philadelphia is known for scrapple, a loaf made of cornmeal with pork scraps, including liver, plus spices – a polarising food. It's served sliced and fried crisp on the outside. I once immersed myself in the topic, doing a blind scrapple tasting, looking for the best. It's diner food, widely available, including at the market, and no one who loves it seems to complain about the quality anywhere.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417901110'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379420687805/Diners-eating-Chesapeake--001.jpg' alt='Diners eating Chesapeake Bay crabs at The Crab Claw Restaurant St Michaels Chesapeake Bay Maryland' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Diners eating Chesapeake Bay crabs. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Heading south-east from Philly, the former manufacturing city of <strong>Baltimore</strong> is still an important seaport. It sits on the wide Patapsco river where it joins Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore has grit and character. Chefs draw on the enormous and wonderful bay, which is one of the world's most biologically rich bodies of water.</p><p>Blue crabs are not only delicious, they are also the most important food that comes from the bay, in terms of quantity. They're at the soft-shell stage from May to September. It's fascinating to watch the crabs moult, which takes place in \"floats\" – special crab pens on the water or at the water's edge. They're easy to spot in places on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, such as around Crisfield. But Baltimore is where the chefs cook them best.</p><p>I grew up in Maryland and love its hilly farmland, settled more than three centuries ago. Much of it has been swallowed up by housing, but a new generation of small farms provides great local ingredients. A key Chesapeake item, nearly lost in the 20th century and now being revived, is the pretty, and tasty, hot fish pepper, an African-American chilli once associated with Baltimore's oyster- and crabhouses, which explains the name. As the fish pepper ripens, it becomes green-and-white striped, before turning brilliant red. A great proponent of Chesapeake food is Spike Gjerde, the chef at Baltimore's <a href=\"http://www.woodberrykitchen.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Woodberry Kitchen</strong></a>. There you can buy dried fish pepper and fish pepper hot sauce, as well as eat the pepper and other prime ingredients in various dishes.</p><p>So there you have it, a foodie trip down the whole of the north-east. From Maine to Maryland, the landscape and ingredients are so diverse that you might feel like you're in two different countries.</p><p><strong>Edward Behr is the author of</strong><a

Big characters, adventurous in business, dangerous at backgammon, generous with rum – but I never fully survived a drive that started at their place, or followed their directions.</p><p>The first time I drove from their yard I was held overnight at the Mexican border post they recommended, where my residency was cancelled despite paying gratuities. That post phoned the next and I was detained there as well, my residency cancelled again, after paying gratuities the first post told the next I was good for. It all eventually led to me living and writing in Ireland, hence the boys' responsibility – plus here borders are open, and officers are content to just be smug.</p><p>In the meantime, though, I roamed as a tourist over that border. The second time I left the Riveras, seeing that I was driving nearly seven litres of Americana, the boys loaned me a radar detector, which in the end only beeped after a sheriff's deputy reached the window to book me for speeding. Then I was busted for the detector as well. And still I returned – but by the third time I hit Rivera territory, I just parked the car in their yard and had them drive me to the airport after a fortnight of lending each other money and choosing who would make Leroy go for beer.</p><p>A few months after I left, they sold the car.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397645344'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350042131165/DBC-Pierre-on-the-road-001.jpg' alt='DBC Pierre on the road' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>DBC Pierre on the road</figcaption></figure><p>It's a long introduction, I know; but things are richer with context, and it lays a context for this: in the end I devised a road trip from Houston that avoids the Rivera brothers altogether. A weekender like a TV movie, where a girl slams a motel door, where pumpjacks and crickets compete in the night, where guitar players called Cletus drink rye. A ready-meal road trip that we can take today, a mixture of neon lights and nooks and crannies; because although the perfect drive is the one without a destination, if we're travelling from here we don't have the time to ask that many gas station attendants the way to the interstate. With these instructions, all the realities and hospitalities, the expected and unexpected beauty of central Texas can unfold without need of a map; we just have to get to Houston.</p><p>Even without a destination, a good road trip will have a goal, however; and this, if not risky, should at least mess with temptation – chasing fruitless infatuations, gambling, escaping an abusive partner, or a suicide pact with a friend are all valid fuels for the road. For this starter road trip, the goal must be Texas barbecue: the best in the land, beef as soft as sashimi, served by the pound, on paper.</p><p>For vegetarians there can be turkey and beans.</p><p>To do it properly we need to rent a Dodge Charger, if not a small truck. It's not a long drive for a weekend, maybe an eight-hour round trip. If you draw the route on a map, you'll see it's a small triangle in south central Texas – but bear in mind that Texas is almost three times the size of the UK, plus any itinerary should have room to sit and hear the world creak in a breeze. As this page goes to press it's 28C in central Texas, and humid. Grackles chatter in trees.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397645345'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958983798/Blacks-BBQ-001.jpg' alt='Blacks BBQ' width='460' height='423' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Black's Barbecue in Lockhart, Texas.

I once saw Larry Hagman here, back when he really thought he was JR – suddenly we risk seeing him again. If we're travelling with children or parents, now is the time to leave them; children can shuttle to the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html\" title=\"\">Johnson Space Center</a>, parents to the Houston Medical Centre, arranging to meet on Monday before the flight back.</p><p>Pick up the car. Before setting the mirrors, tune the radio to 102.5FM, KMKS, a Bay City station with range. Leave the airport and turn right on to the Sam Houston Tollway, heading west to Interstate 10, the Katy Freeway. This junction is the closest we come to the Rivera brothers. Keep moving. If you're a ZZ Top fan, we pass the turn off to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1380&amp;bih=871&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=s0Bb3slaKBUI0M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zztopgreatest.htm&amp;docid=NEHZqyiBasGuqM&amp;imgurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zzlagrange.jpg&amp;w=754&amp;h=743&amp;ei=JVN1ULzZAaHU0QXUo4GoBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=185&amp;vpy=144&amp;dur=1226&amp;hovh=223&amp;hovw=226&amp;tx=137&amp;ty=110&amp;sig=103750408551928658366&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=153&amp;tbnw=155&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:71\" title=\"\">La Grange</a>, and can detour and pose at the road sign. If not then, two-and-a-bit hours west along I-10, keep an eye out for signs to Luling and Lockhart.</p><p>For these two-and-a-bit hours a local might say there's not much to see – but it's a good time to reflect on how hard it is to imagine John Wayne riding through these subtropics; and to calculate that there are 254 counties in Texas, a mixture of wet, dry, and moist counties, alcoholic beverage-wise. Moist counties are wet and dry depending when and where you are.</p><p>Take a right into Luling on 183, cross the railway lines, and across the road to the left (633 East Davis Street) sits City Market – the holy grail of beef brisket. If it's before six in the evening, go in for a pound in butcher's paper, with a jalapeño, some potato salad, bread or beans. After six, mark the spot to return for breakfast or lunch. Note the heavy smell in the air around here – crude oil. This is a town where oil pumpjacks spring out of backyards and roadsides, many decorated, turned into moving characters, cowboys, grasshoppers, girls, planes.</p><p>Drive a few miles up 183, watching out for skunks if it's dark – hit one and never smell the same again – and just before Lockhart, the Plum Creek Inn (<a href=\"http://www.plumcreekinn.net/\" title=\"\">plumcreekinn.net</a>), our motel, appears on the left. What can we say, a motel – big rooms, a swimming pool, air conditioners, no Laura Ashley. In the movie of your life a girl slams a door. Maybe some neon fizzes and crackles. Critters make noise in the grass.</p><p>From here it's a quick drive to the old town centre of Lockhart – mecca of barbecue, and somewhere small to wander and soak up. Find North Main Street, at the far side of the courthouse square, and stroll north to Lilly's at number 110, a beer shop and pool joint – practise your Spanish, one of those nice ladies is Lilly – or walk on one block to Black's Barbecue (<a href=\"http://www.blacksbbq.com\" title=\"\">blacksbbq.com</a>) the oldest continuously owned barbecue restaurant in Texas.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397645346'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958911674/San-Antonio-riverfront-001.jpg' alt='San Antonio riverfront' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The San Antonio Paseo del Rio river walk, Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>And after collapsing to late-night TV – maybe something with a motel in it – there's only one way to spend Saturday if the car is pointed up highway 183: follow it a while more to Austin, through Mustang Ridge and past Bergstrom Airport, veering left down East 7th Street to East 6th Street. This is the home of live music in the south, a mellow chaos of blues, rock and country. Get lit up at Shakespeare's Pub (<a href=\"http://www.shakespearesaustin.com/main.html\" title=\"\">shakespearesaustin.com</a>) then trawl the street for the bands that most pull you in.</p><p>To recover on Sunday, with our mayhem all rinsed out, a long drive down Interstate 35 to San Antonio is the key – for my money San Antone is one of the three most beautiful cities in the US. Hang out by the river, visit the Alamo, eat an enchilada and ponder – this is where Mexico lost its northern state of Texas in battle.</p><p>Then, driving down I-10 back to Houston, reflect: the Rivera boys are still levelling the score.</p><p>• <em>DBC Pierre's first novel </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571215164\" title=\"\"><em>Vernon

The great American road trip goes west, not east, and it ends at the barrier of the Pacific Ocean. Westward like the pioneers, you travel through ever bigger, emptier and more dramatic landscapes. The skies get taller. The horizons stretch out. You reach the great national parks of the Rockies, where wolves and bears and something close to wilderness still exists, and drive on through the red rock canyonlands of Utah and Arizona.</p><p>The worst mistake is to be in a hurry. The drive from New York to California is 2,800 miles if you make the mistake of taking the most direct route. If you loop and detour as you should, it's closer to 3,500 miles, and you want at least 10 days and preferably three weeks or more. Use the interstate highways when you have long stretches to cross, but be sure to meander down plenty of backroads.</p><p>Unless you have the sort of personality that can't stand it any other way, keep the planning to a minimum. A cross-country road trip should be a loose, freewheeling, improvisational adventure, full of surprises and sudden friendships with extraordinary strangers.</p><p>Bars are always good places to meet people. So are independent bookstores – where they survive. The staff invariably know the best places to eat and drink locally, and if there happens to be a cool band playing that night, or a wrestling contest in the back of a local feed store, they can usually tell you about that too. Be observant. America is a land of many signs and billboards, and this is how you'll find your way to, say, the World's Largest Prairie Dog, or a saloon called something like Bad Barb's Vapors.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397644698'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967311338/Richard-Grant-001.jpg' alt='Richard Grant' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Richard Grant on the road</figcaption></figure><p>If a weird rock formation glimpsed off in the distance looks appealing, get yourself over there. A hummingbird might buzz your face; a coyote might trot past. Maybe you'll experience a moment of perfect silence, or run across an eccentric burying an old fridge full of modern artefacts as a time capsule for future archeologists.</p><p>I used to go across the country with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, and sleep in the back of whatever shitheap car I had bought for the trip. These days I'm not so pure. I like a dependable vehicle and I stay in motels until I reach the western deserts and mountains. Then I look for remote public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (<a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html\" title=\"\">blm.gov/wo/st/en.html</a>) where I can camp for free and build a fire, usually without sticking to a designated area. I pack a sleeping bag and sometimes a tent, and I never get on the road without a camp stove, an espresso pot, and a pound or two of good ground coffee. Motel and gas station coffee is almost uniformly awful. A bottle of whiskey is a true friend if you find yourself in a dry county down south, and a gallon of water can quite literally save your life if you break down on a desert backroad in summer. I also pack a knife, fork, matches, can-opener and corkscrew, and a small grill to prop over a campfire.</p><p>Gastronomic despair is a real possibility, especially on interstates. The same fast food restaurants cluster at every exit — Mickey-D's, Burger Thing, Junk In The Box, Pizza Butt, Dead Lobster and Taco Hell. There are now websites devoted to eating well across the country, and while I check them obsessively in gas stations and motels, the results are usually disappointing. The websites are crowd-sourced, which means that most of the reviewers don't know what they're talking about. <a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/boards\" title=\"\">Chowhound.com</a> is the best of them, but I'd advise looking up the recommendations of  top American food writers such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/oct/13/foodanddrink.features5\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Steingarten</a> or Jonathan Gold.</p><p>The most direct route across the US takes you through the flat cornfields of the Midwest, where American food, and arguably American culture, is at its least zesty. I advise a more southerly course, for the music and storytelling and because the south has barbecue. The meat, which is usually pork shoulder and ribs until you reach Texas, where it changes to beef brisket, is rubbed or marinated with spices and tenderisers, and then cooked slowly for many hours over woodsmoke in a pit or chamber. Hot damn! Done right, it's amazingly succulent and tangy, and there are dozens of regional variations. An Alabama prison guard once told me his favourite barbecue was \"so good it make you wanna hurt somebody!\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397644699'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967238887/Mississippi-Riverboat-001.jpg' alt='Mississippi Riverboat' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A riverboat on the Mississippi. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Presumably, you will have supplied yourself with some suitable American music for the journey. If the blues sounds good in Clapham, try listening to Muddy Waters or Fred McDowell when driving through the swamps and cotton fields of the Mississippi delta. Better yet, stop off in a raw backcountry juke joint, buy a pint of moonshine from the man outside and hear the last surviving bluesmen playing it live. You will feel very foreign, but not unwelcome.</p><p>Tom Waits has a knack for getting you through the last miles to a motel when you're dead tired. When you're driving through a thunderstorm at night on the high plains of Colorado, try Bob Dylan. Gram Parsons sounds just right in the desert, and so do the new tripped-out DJ sounds of Gonjasufi.</p><p>The first time I drove across the country, I felt so liberated and happy – and so dejected when we reached the end of the road and stared out at the Pacific. So I drove back the other way to New Orleans, and then up to Montana, and down to Arizona. For a couple of years, I lived on the road, sleeping in cars and tents and other people's houses, doing odd jobs and pieces of journalism. You hear a lot of windy nonsense trumpeted about freedom in America, especially by politicians, but when you're roaming around the enormous public lands of the American west, sleeping next to a different campfire every night, you're about as free as you can realistically get in this day and age, and that's the best reason there is to hit the road.</p><p><em>• Read more about Richard's travels at </em><a href=\"http://www.richardgrant.us/\" title=\"\"><em>richardgrant.us</em></a><em>.

A brutal cold wind whips in off the lake, direct from the Canadian wilderness. Among the huddle of buildings is a small brewery and an outfitting store (We Welcome Hunters and Trappers). Further up, a clapboard house is, appropriately, called End of the Trail.</p><p>We have driven more than 1,000 miles to get here, to the very edge of the US. To give our two-year-old daughter, Nell, the experience of being in the wilds, my husband and I have brought her on a road trip through Michigan, to its remote Upper Peninsula, on a route rated  one of North America's best for autumn colour. We are in effect circumnavigating Lake Michigan, with a few detours.</p><p>The name Michigan comes from the Native American word <em>michigama</em>, meaning great lake. With 3,288 miles of shoreline, Michigan has more coast than the US's entire eastern seaboard. Our journey takes us through scenic inland waterways, giant dunes, old-growth forests, and vast inland seas.</p><p>With Chicago behind us, we head up the eastern shore of Lake Michigan in a rented motorhome, our passport to the wilds when travelling with a young child. We cover many miles in the first couple of days, cruising up Route 31. Beyond the highway and strip malls are small, genteel towns with immaculate harbours, catering for well-heeled tourists and second-home owners.</p><p>In the warm autumn light we pass farmers' markets and fruit farms. In tented shelters by the road, trestle tables are piled high with wooden boxes of blueberries, apples and raspberries. Michigan is well-known as a fruit-growing state, and Traverse City is famed as the cherry capital of the US. The state is also home to around 100 vineyards and wineries, producing particularly good rieslings. We dine well as we travel north.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397644417'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966873674/Kari-Herbert-and-Nell-at--001.jpg' alt='Kari Herbert and Nell at Hurricane Bay' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Kari with daughter Nell at Hurricane Bay</figcaption></figure><p>At night, we opt for rustic state forest campsites, often in areas of outstanding natural beauty. We cook over a fire, reading and talking by candlelight. In the darkness, we can see the glow of other campfires and hear nothing but the distant murmur of voices and the wind in the trees. We're alone, but with others nearby; there is comfort in these woods. In the mornings, Nell plays on the golden beaches by the clear waters of Lake Michigan, and dances through piles of leaves and pine cones in the forests.</p><p>Our first major destination is Sleeping Bear Dunes national park, named after a Chippewa legend which tells how a forest fire on the lake's western shore drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake. After many miles of swimming, the mother bear reached safety and waited on a high bluff for her cubs to join her. Too tired to continue, the cubs drowned within sight of the shore. The great spirit Manitou created two islands to mark where the cubs disappeared and a solitary dune to represent the mother.</p><p>Wind and erosion have greatly reduced the size of the \"bear\" over the years; nevertheless, this 35-mile stretch of towering dunes, forests and beaches is consistently voted as one of the most beautiful places in the US. We pay $10 to take the seven-mile Pierce Stocking scenic drive – a gentle loop through woodland with spectacular viewpoints over forests and lake.</p><p>Down on the lakeshore the dune climb is also popular, particularly for kids. On top of the giant dune, we are 150m above the lake, which stretches almost 60 miles west towards Wisconsin, hidden by the curve of the Earth. We continue north, passing Traverse City and Elk Rapids and a sign announcing the 45th parallel – halfway between the equator and the North Pole. Cheered by this unexpected landmark, we pull over for a cup of tea and a slice of apple pie.</p><p>Miles of blueberry and corn fields and acres of vines are punctuated by immaculate tall red barns and stands of pine, aspen and maple. Halloween is fast approaching. Pick-ups at roadside stalls are filled with pumpkins and dark-skinned gourds.</p><p>The leaves are beginning to deepen: golds of the trembling aspen and white birch, burnished copper of white ash, and russets and deep blood-reds of sugar maple and black gum trees. We'd been told many times that the autumn colours get better the further north you go. This is true of many things in Michigan: fewer bugs, fewer tourists, cleaner air. We want to get to the wilds, to big country, to solitude.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway figures large in this landscape. His lazy childhood days beside Walloon Lake and in the nearby streams and woods fundamentally influenced his writing. Many of his short stories were based here.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397644418'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966820720/Lake-Superior-the-Shipwre-001.jpg' alt='Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast.' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>We take a short detour to Horton Bay on Lake Charlevoix, a favourite spot for those following a Hemingway trail. Beside the General Store is the Red Fox Inn, where Hemingway stayed as a young man, and whose owner, Vollie Fox, taught him to fish. Handpainted signs tell the story. The wonderful store, too, is full of memorabilia. The store owner, Chip Lorenger, spreads a well-used map on the bar and directs us to some of his favourite places.</p><p>Taking his advice we head out on the backroads following a route taken by Hemingway and his first wife after their wedding in 1921. \"See all that,\" Hemingway told his bride. \"Talk about the beauty of the Bay of Naples! I've seen them both, and no place is more beautiful than Little Traverse in its autumn colours.\" We cannot help but agree as we swing round the bay and make our way on route 119 towards the great <a href=\"http://www.mackinacbridge.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Bridge</a>, gateway to the Upper Peninsula and roughly the halfway point of our journey. To mark this – and to enjoy a hot bath and good food – we leave the motorhome and catch a ferry to <a href=\"http://www.mackinacisland.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Island</a>.</p><p>Cars are prohibited here, so residents and visitors use bicycles or horse-drawn carriages. It is a slightly unreal but enjoyable escape into nostalgia. Numerous fudge shops pump their sweet, chocolatey fumes into the street as day trippers pour off the ferry. We spend a night at the impressive Grand Hotel, built colonial-style in Michigan white pine. Opened in 1887, it is the grand dame of American hotels.</p><p>Back on the mainland, we head towards the famed Tahquamenon Falls on the northern side of the peninsula, setting for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha. At the village of Paradise we turn west and enter wilderness territory – 1,000 square miles of old-growth forest. At its heart is the Tahquamenon, the \"dark river\" or \"golden river\" of the poem. The upper falls are the largest waterfall east of the Mississippi river, after Niagara.</p><p>Snow is beginning to fall as we rent a small boat and row to the island between the five smaller cascades that form the Lower Falls. We have the place to ourselves. Chipmunks scurry across our path as we step over logs half-gnawed by beavers. We watch the play of colours across the falling water – the crimson, gold and russet forest framing the brown, churning torrents.</p><p>The warmth of the previous week is gone. The thermometer has dropped by 20 degrees overnight. Days before, a man in flip-flops and T-shirt had said, \"Enjoying the weather, are ya? Make the most of it. Winter is coming.\"</p><p>As the cold bites, we begin to see why many of the local residents head south, like birds, to warmer climes. Many places in the Upper Peninsula can expect between four and five metres of snow during the winter.</p><p>We reach the far north of Michigan. At Muskallonge Lake state park the tarmac ends. On a rutted track we grope our way slowly along the shores of Lake Superior, as white-tailed deer cross our path. This is a seasonal route, accessible in winter only by snowmobile. It's dark by the time we arrive at the Hurricane River campsite. A sign pinned to the small registration hut warns of black bears. Our motorhome is shaken through the night by growling winds. We wake to find the skylights covered in snow and a carapace of ice.</p><p>We are on the fringes of the 40-mile Pictured Rocks shoreline, a sandstone escarpment that runs from Laughing Whitefish Falls to Tahquamenon in the east. This dramatic exposure of rocks is Michigan's top tourist attraction – and best viewed from a boat on the water in milder weather.</p><p>As the storm clouds pass, we walk to the shoreline and find one of the most beautiful, and the most treacherous, beaches I have ever seen. This northern shore of Michigan on Lake Superior is known as the Shipwreck Coast. Waves crash on the bone-white sand. We walk through spray towards the Au Sable lighthouse, our daughter gathering up sand-polished stones – agate, jasper, quartz, basalt and hematite – and rolling them into the surf.</p><p>We can just spot the teeth of the infamous sandstone reef appearing through the waves. We weave our way along the beach and over jutting platforms of marbled rocks, to cut back on to the trail through fir and aspen.</p><p>As we near the lighthouse, we begin to see the shipwrecks. Black ribs jut out of the sand, the remains of the hull of a boat. Farther on lies another nautical skeleton. There is beauty here, but desolation too, and we feel that particularly now, as winter approaches.</p><p>We reach Au Sable Point and watch the darkening sky. We cannot go any farther north. This is the edge of the US, and the Canadian wilderness lies beyond these perilous waters. That will be another journey.</p><p>It's often the road to nowhere that brings you to exactly the place you need to be. Many of the roads we have taken to get here were glorious. For the most part, the delight was in the driving: each turn of the road providing a different display of indescribable autumnal colour.</p><p>We didn't know it when we started out, but this place is our turning point. With wind-stung cheeks, we sing our way back down the trail to ward off black bears. We have the storm at our backs and something of the wilderness in our hearts. This is what we came for.</p><p>• <em>Kari Herbert's latest book is </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Wives-Remarkable-Behind-Explorers/dp/192681262X/ref=sr_1_2?\" title=\"\"><em>Polar

Corral but Tombstone is still milking that most famous of western shootouts – between the Earps and the Clantons – for every cent. And the latest piece of Earpsploitation is Virgil's Corner. Now a boutique B&amp;B, it was once the home of Virgil Earp. Virgil was the kingpin of the Earp family. When things reached a head with the Clanton gang, he deputised his younger brother Wyatt and his friend \"Doc\" Holliday to help him sort things out. We have heard of Wyatt because, unlike his brothers, he lived to a ripe old age, long enough to spin the tale.</p><p>Virgil was senior lawman in Tombstone and built a house a couple of blocks from the O.K. Corral in 1880. The More family took on the house in 1969 – but it was badly damaged by fire in 1998. Timbers that survived, including original doors, had been put into storage. And all of them have now been incorporated in the B&amp;B's front section, which replicates Virgil's original 14ft x19ft house.</p><p>\"I started planning and dreaming of the B&amp;B because of the location and historical significance of the property,\" said Diane More. \"I hated to think it would just be a vacant lot. What better way to allow people to experience the wild west than to build a B&amp;B on a historic site in Tombstone?\"</p><p>Diane scoured antique shops across Arizona and Texas for authentic items for the B&amp;B. And when it eventually came to decorating the place, she chose paint colours that had been available in the 1880s.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397694683'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349871238050/Virgils-Corner-former-Ear-001.jpg' alt='Virgil's Corner, former Earp family home' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Virgil's Corner, former Earp family home</figcaption></figure><p>That probably explains why, to contemporary eyes, the decor looks a bit on the drab side: cheap but not overly cheerful. Remember, though, that this would have been the height of sophistication in the late-19th century – and still wild – west, where mud, wood and sawdust were established style statements.</p><p>The silver stars on the bedheads are a little tacky, especially the big one saying \"US Marshal\" over the bed in Virgil's room. But this is a town for western fans, and Virgil's Corner is as close as you're going to get to the homely ambience of the old days.</p><p>If, like me, you're a sucker for the Wyatt Earp legend, you get a hell of a kick knowing that you're sleeping on the spot where he and his brothers used to get together of an evening.</p><p>Some parts of Tombstone have been \"restored\" to the point where you feel like you're in a theme park. The O.K. Corral is still there and, inevitably, there is a daily re-enactment of the gunfight. Big Nose Kate's saloon on East Allen Street, named after Holliday's girlfriend, is a very touristy version of its original incarnation as the town's Grand Hotel, but it still has the same long bar at which the Earps and the Clantons would have taken their drinks.</p><p>There is probably nothing better after a night at the saloon than breakfast at Virgil's Corner …</p><p><em>• Virgil's Corner (97 East Fremont Street, +1 520 548 1025, </em><a href=\"http://www.virgilscorner.com\" title=\"\"><em>virgilscorner.com</em></a><em>) has doubles from $98.

Inside the restaurant, which has been championing \"locavore\" fare for 14 years, 1960s Americana streams from the speakers, a waiter in hotpants and oversized hipster specs serves us bloody marys, and I'm about to take a bite of a juicy, grass-fed burger.</p><p>Since Diner opened in 1998, Brooklyn's food scene has grown exponentially, and now ranges from three Michelin stars at <a href=\"http://www.brooklynfare.com/\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Fare</a> to American-Asian sharing plates at <a href=\"http://taldebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">Talde</a>, progressive pizza at <a href=\"http://robertaspizza.com\" title=\"\">Roberta's</a>, and rib-sticking southern barbecue at <a href=\"http://fettesaubbq.com\" title=\"\">Fette Sau</a>.</p><p>When I say I'm in New York mainly for a bite of the second borough, a well-respected New York chef quips, \"We do have restaurants in Manhattan too, you know.\" I can understand his exasperation: Brooklyn is rather hogging the culinary limelight. Of<a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/2012/09/best-new-restaurants-2012\" title=\"\"> Bon Appétit magazine's best new restaurants in America 2012</a>, two (<a href=\"http://www.blancanyc.com/\" title=\"\">Blanca</a> and <a href=\"http://battersbybrooklyn.com\" title=\"\">Battersby</a>) were in Brooklyn; none was from over the bridge.</p><p>It's not just restaurants that make Brooklyn a foodie destination. Its grass-roots food culture takes in everything from street food – the brilliant Smorgasburg Sunday \"flea food market\", with stalls selling everything from oysters to beef jerky – to decent blue collar bar food as seen at newbie Pork Slope (<a href=\"http://www.porkslopebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">porkslopebrooklyn.com</a>), and a local brewing scene.</p><p>As an American food obsessive, I jumped at the chance to join burger expert and craft beer nut Tom Byng on a \"research tour\" of the meaty, beery hotspots of Brooklyn.</p><p>\"In the UK we've been drinking flavoured water for decades, thinking it was beer, but the Americans pack theirs full of flavour, which is great for burgers because the flavours stand up to it,\" says the restaurateur, whose regular research visits underpin the food and drink at his UK-based Byron burger chain.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397770791'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349955327401/Burger-at-Diner-Brooklyn-001.jpg' alt='Burger at Diner, Brooklyn' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Burger with skin-on fries and pickled red onion at Diner in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</figcaption></figure><p>\"This is late for me,\" he says. \"I've eaten a burger at 7am before now. When you do tours like this, you have to start early.\"</p><p>We're pleased with Diner's freshly ground, simple, but well-put-together burgers ($14.50), which come with a molten slick of sharp American cheddar and a dwarfing mound of crunchy, skin-on fries.</p><p>\"The pickled red onion is a nice touch, and the Yanks are way ahead of us on burger buns,\" says Byng, holding up a Jewish challah-style bun, golden and brioche-like in its sweetness and texture. It's a decadent spread for breakfast-time, but the quality of the ingredients shines through.</p><p>We're now interested in a midday tipple, and soon find ourselves in the midst of the tour crowds at Brooklyn Brewery. The UK is the brewery's second-largest export market after Sweden, and it supplies hip bars from Aberdeen to London. It started in 1988, when founders Steve Hindy and Tom Potter set about reviving Brooklyn's forgotten brewing past (before prohibition, the borough boasted 48 breweries). I try the Fiat Lux Brewmaker Reserve, a one-off, small-batch beer that changes every quarter. This one is flavoured with coriander and lime peel and is rich, hoppy and aromatic, with an underlying sourness.</p><p>While its beer may be sold all over the world, the Brooklyn Brewery's local impact should not be underplayed: when it opened here, Williamsburg was desolate and mildly scary. Now it's a desirable neighbourhood full of independent shops, cafes, craft beer-led pubs such as Mugs Alehouse (<a href=\"http://mugsalehouse.com/\" title=\"\">mugsalehouse.com</a>) and beer delis such as Bierkraft (<a href=\"http://www.bierkraft.com\" title=\"\">bierkraft.com</a>), which sells more than 1,000 brews.</p><p>It has also paved the way for other alcohol producers, including the <a href=\"http://sixpoint.com/\" title=\"\">Sixpoint</a> craft brewery further south in Redhook. Brooklyn Brewery co-founder Tom Potter has opened the <a href=\"http://nydistilling.com/\" title=\"\">New York Distilling Company</a>, also in Williamsburg, where we sample some throat-scorching Perry's Tot gin.</p><p>Most local bars and burger joints  stock these brews. At Dutch Boy Burger, at 766 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, a kitsch diner gives way to a dark craft beer room complete with vintage arcade games, and the burger comes with a fried mushroom and onion topping.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397770792'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349969877587/Beer-pumps-at-Barcade-001.jpg' alt='Beer pumps at Barcade' width='460' height='618' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Beer pumps at Barcade</figcaption></figure><p>Arcade games from the 1980s are also in vogue at Barcade (<a href=\"http://barcadebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">barcadebrooklyn.com</a>), back in Williamsburg, where I order the Ta Henket ancient ale. This is brewed by Delaware craft brewery <a href=\"http://www.dogfish.com\" title=\"\">Dogfish Head</a>, according to methods specified in (get this!) ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It's fermented with Egyptian yeast, and flavoured with Middle Eastern herbs. I have never tasted anything quite like it, but I love its complexity and weirdness, its spicy apple notes.</p><p>Then it's on to the legendary Spuyten Duyvil (<a href=\"http://www.spuytenduyvilnyc.com\" title=\"\">spuytenduyvilnyc.com</a>) bar over the expressway on Metropolitan Avenue. Blackboards are scrawled with wonderfully named beers, there's an old red bike on the wall, and retro barbers' chairs provide comfy seating. We try a refreshing, aromatic, slightly fruity <a href=\"http://stillwaterales.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stillwater</a> pale ale, which is made by a nomadic, small-batch brewer using wild yeast.</p><p>And it's not just beers that are being fermented. At new waterfront restaurant Governor (<a href=\"http://www.governordumbo.com/\" title=\"\">governordumbo.com</a>) in Dumbo, 32-year-old chef Brad McDonald (previously of Noma and Per Se), is fermenting his own tongue-twitchingly intense soy sauce to adorn sweet, pearlescent jewels of raw scallop.</p><p>\"Being in Brooklyn means a lot,\" he tells me from his open kitchen. \"It's a hotbed of culinary creativity, art and forward thinking, and it's going through a huge artisanal renaissance.\"</p><p>• <em>The trip was provided by Byron (</em><a href=\"http://www.byronhamburgers.com\" title=\"\"><em>byronhamburgers.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>","headline":"Beer and burgers: how Brooklyn, New York, is brewing up a storm","trailText":"<p>The brewing scene has been revived across the water from Manhattan. <strong>Rosie Birkett</strong> chows down on beers and burgers, guided by an expert</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"9","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349969692773/Diner-restaurant-in-Brook-003.jpg","wordcount":"869","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"397455329","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6757276","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Rosie Birkett","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-10-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1812531","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-10-15T21:45:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/12/brooklyn-new-york-beer-food","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/oct/12/brooklyn-new-york-beer-food","tags":[{"id":"travel/newyork","webTitle":"New York","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/newyork","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/newyork","references":[]},{"id":"travel/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/usa","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/american","webTitle":"American food and drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/american","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/american","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/beer","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/beer","references":[]},{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/travelfoodanddrink","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/travelfoodanddrink","references":[]},{"id":"travel/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/restaurants","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/restaurants","references":[]},{"id":"travel/bars","webTitle":"Bars and clubs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/bars","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/bars","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rosie-birkett","webTitle":"Rosie Birkett","r2ContributorId":"34213","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/15/1253026898149/Rosie-Birkett-001.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rosie Birkett is a freelance journalist specialising in food and restaurant writing.

But I'm more interested in two of its more specific boasts: its growing reputation as a gourmet hotspot – where slow-cooked, traditional Southern food is experiencing a revival – and the fact that it was voted Sexiest City in America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. What more incentive does a greedy single girl need to head down south?</p><p>Before I've had a chance to size up the local talent, I am seduced by the prettiness of the genteel port city itself. Founded by the English in 1670, it has picturesque streets lined with palm trees and original, old-timey gas lamps, in front of pastel-painted townhouses with pillars and porches, just begging for a languid afternoon spent lounging with a mint julep. Still so low-rise is the perfectly preserved city that a cruise liner parked in the harbour looms over the rooftops and spires like an ocean-going Godzilla.</p><p>My first pit stop is at a tiny diner, the Dixie Supply Bakery &amp; Café (<a href=\"http://www.dixiecafecharleston.com/\" title=\"\">dixiecafecharleston.com</a>) at 62 State Street. It's only open for breakfast and lunch, and most of the menu hovers around the $5 mark. Famed throughout the state for its tomato pie  – flavour-packed tomatoes layered with cheese, garlic, basil and spring onions, in a pie crust, served in slices with a hunk of homemade amber-coloured cornbread – it also specialises in the rib-sticking southern dish of shrimp and grits. Grits – a semolina-like paste, made from ground corn cooked with milk and cream –  is something of an acquired taste, which, I must confess, I have not yet acquired.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397626279'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951383662/Shops-in-Rainbow-Row-Char-001.jpg' alt='Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston.' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>While the city has a growing reputation among the foodie fraternity, and was an early adopter of the locally grown movement, its cuisine is firmly anchored in the past – from rustic barbecue joints to a rash of new fine-dining restaurants. These include the award-winning Husk (<a href=\"http://www.huskrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">huskrestaurant.com</a>) named Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appétit magazine in 2011, where nothing grown or farmed outside of the south is served.</p><p>English settlers arriving here in the 17th century made full use of the pigs left behind by the Spanish, and found its protected peninsula teeming with hundreds of species of seafood. Native Americans taught them which crops would thrive in the swampy, alligator-infested environment, namely corn, sierra beans, and squash. And the arrival of a wave of French Huguenots in the 18th century, drawn by the city's pledge of religious tolerance to all, brought desserts to the party, plus even more emphasis on pork, introducing charcuterie and cassoulets.</p><p>Less nobly, Charleston was also the centre of the slave trade in the 18th century: three out of four enslaved Africans arrived in America through this port city. But the ships which docked in the harbour brought with them not only slaves but also cooking and farming practices, introducing rice, okra – eaten fried or in soup – collard greens, aubergines and peanuts. And after more than half a century of celebrating convenience foods, the Lowcountry, as the region is known, is returning – like much of America – to its culinary roots.</p><p>Central to this is barbecue – by which the locals mainly mean pork, the definitive ingredient of southern cooking. At Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Que at 288 King Street, I round off a day of non-stop munching with tender pulled pork, slow-cooked for seven hours, and served with a cheese biscuit (which is nothing like a biscuit, and something like a scone), and collard greens, boiled with and flavoured by juicy lumps of bacon.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397626280'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951454834/Peninsula-Grills-coconut--001.jpg' alt='Peninsula Grill's coconut cake' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Peninsula Grill's coconut cake, Charleston</figcaption></figure><p>Charleston's compact size makes it one of the few US cities where it is possible to spend a few days without needing a car. But while exploring the city on foot helps you digest all that hearty southern food, it also means you may end up walking past Kaminsky's Baking Company (<a href=\"http://www.kaminskys.com/\" title=\"\">kaminskys.com</a>) on N Market Street, famed for its desserts and, dangerously, open until 2am. Just as perilous is Market Street Sweets up the road, with its lip-smacking pralines, peanut brittle and bear-claw caramels. A uniformed temptress calls \"Free samples\" from the doorway, like the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Next door, the Peninsula Grill (<a href=\"http://peninsulagrill.com\" title=\"\">peninsulagrill.com</a>) serves its celebrated, sensual coconut cake in 1lb slabs, for sharing.</p><p>As I stagger home, trying to dodge the sweet treats, I realise, a little too late, that I have assiduously road-tested the cuisine, but not surveyed the city's sexiness. But with my mind now firmly on finding something with a stretchy waistband, the men of Charleston will just have to wait for another, less gluttonous, day.</p><p><em>• Flights to Charleston were provided by US Airways (</em><a href=\"http://www.usairways.com\" title=\"\"><em>usairways.com</em></a><em>), which flies from Gatwick to Charleston, via Charlotte, North Carolina, from £555 return.

What makes it so special? There's its arts scene: <strong>Carnegie Hall</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehallwv.com\" title=\"\">carnegiehallwv.com</a>) for arthouse films, lectures and live music, and a jazz and blues festival; <strong>Greenbrier Valley Theatre</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.gvtheatre.org/\" title=\"\">gvtheatre.org</a>); art galleries (<a href=\"http://www.downtownlewisburg.com/galleries.html\" title=\"\">downtownlewisburg.com</a>); and its literary festival (<a href=\"http://www.lewisburgliteraryfestival.com/\" title=\"\">lewisburgliteraryfestival.com</a>). The historic district has around 60 18th- and 19th-century buildings, including a lovely church and a museum. Surrounding <strong>Greenbrier county</strong> is known for meat, cheese and fruit, sold at the farmers' market on Saturday mornings and in local cafes and restaurants. There's a buzzing cafe culture, two artisan bakers and two annual food festivals. Out of town there is great hiking and cycling in wooded and mountainous countryside, and fishing and rafting on the <strong>Greenbrier river</strong>. Accommodation ranges from historic inns and quaint B&amp;Bs in town to log cabins and country estates, such as <strong>Swift Level</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.theswiftlevel.com\" title=\"\">theswiftlevel.com</a>, from $225 a night for four), a family-run farmstead.</p><h2>San Luis Obispo, California</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397600501'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967700941/San-Luis-Obispo-Californi-001.jpg' alt='San Luis Obispo, California' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>One of the vineyards near San Luis Obispo. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>This is a college town on the Californian coast, roughly halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It's an old city – one of the oldest in California – but with a youthful vibe. The well-preserved centre has great bars, including a brewpub serving around 10 home-brewed beers (<a href=\"http://www.slobrewingco.com/\" title=\"\">slobrewingco.com</a>). Wine is another big attraction – so it's no wonder this is known as the happiest city in America. <strong>Edna Valley</strong>, <strong>Arroyo Grande Valley</strong> and <strong>Avila Valley</strong> are home to small, family-run wineries, most open for tastings (<a href=\"http://slowine.com/cm/wineries_vineyards/member_wineries.html\" title=\"\">slowine.com</a>). <strong>Koberl at Blue</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.epkoberl.com/\" title=\"\">epkoberl.com</a>) is a restaurant serving dishes specially designed to complement the central coast's wines. The Thursday night market (<a href=\"http://www.slocountyfarmers.org/\" title=\"\">slocountyfarmers.org</a>) is a large, rowdy affair, with students, bands and cyclists clogging the streets. There is a campsite at nearby <strong>Montana de Oro state park</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.slostateparks.com/montana_de_oro/default.asp\" title=\"\">slostateparks.com</a>), which has miles of sandy beaches, and there is great kayaking between Shell and Pismo beaches, where there are sea caves to explore. The <strong>Madonna Inn</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.madonnainn.com/index.php\" title=\"\">madonnainn.com</a>, doubles from $189) is an eccentric local landmark – a theme hotel that's worth a visit, if only to check out the rock waterfall urinal in the men's bathroom.</p><h2>Tucson,  Arizona</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397600502'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967537931/Tucson-Arizona-001.jpg' alt='Tucson, Arizona' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Fox Theatre, Tucson.

Summers here are fiercely hot, with temperatures regularly topping 40C, with a monsoon season in August and September. But winters are mild, with highs up to 24C, and spring – which begins in February – is a wonderful  time to visit. The <strong>Fiesta de los Vaqueros</strong>, or rodeo week, takes place then (16-24 February 2013, <a href=\"http://www.tucsonrodeo.com/\" title=\"\">tucsonrodeo.com</a>). The city centre has been spruced up recently and has some interesting historic areas and architectural gems such as the restored <strong>Fox Theatre</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.foxtucsontheatre.org/mainhome.php\" title=\"\">foxtucsontheatre.org</a>). But the spectacular desert scenery around the city is the real draw: standout spots are <strong>Sabino Canyon </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.sabinocanyon.com/\" title=\"\">sabinocanyon.com</a>) and the village of <strong>Summerhaven</strong> near the summit of Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina mountains; the cactus forests of the <strong>Saguaro national park</strong>; and the limestone caves at <strong>Kartchner Caverns state park</strong> (<a href=\"http://azstateparks.com/Parks/KACA/index.html\" title=\"\">azstateparks.com</a>).

The recently restored <strong>Mahaiwe</strong> performing arts centre (<a href=\"http://www.mahaiwe.org/\" title=\"\">mahaiwe.org</a>) is a cultural focus for the whole south Berkshires, while the <strong>Guthrie Centre</strong> (<a href=\"https://guthriecenter.org\" title=\"\">guthriecenter.org</a>) hosts quirkier events, such as the Troubadour folk music series. Hermann Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne picnicked on <strong>Monument mountain</strong> in 1850, and thousands now follow in their footsteps every year.

But the city is undergoing a resurgence at the moment, with an influx of young creative types and entrepreneurs attracted by low rents and subsidies. The new arrivals have revitalised the downtown district, where bars, restaurants and galleries have opened, and the riverside area is being developed.</p><p>Detroit has been known for music for more than 100 years, from blues, gospel, jazz and Motown to hip-hop and techno – born here in the mid-late 1980s.

It is the foodie capital of the state, with a thrice-weekly farmers' market, five microbrewies, and one of the highest numbers of restaurants per capita in the US. The cuisine is seafood-heavy, with an abundance of lobster and clams. (Wood-oven roasted mussels are a speciality at <strong>Fore Street</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.forestreet.biz\" title=\"\">forestreet.biz</a>.) But the city is also great for vegetarians as well as being more ethnically diverse than other parts of Maine. The cobbled <strong>Old Port area</strong> and the downtown <strong>Arts&nbsp;District</strong> are the hippest places to hang out, both full of galleries, independent shops, restaurants and bars. There is a free self-guided walking tour of the best art venues on the first Friday of each month (<a href=\"http://www.firstfridayartwalk.com/\" title=\"\">firstfridayartwalk.com</a>). The north end of the 2,390-mile <strong>US Highway 1</strong> passes through Portland and makes a very scenic coastal drive. Lobster boats and ferries take passengers on tours of <strong>Casco Bay</strong>, and <strong>Old Orchard Beach</strong>, 19 miles to the south, is a charming resort town.

Now only about 450 people live here, many of them artists and musicians. It is known as America's most vertical city as well as its largest ghost town. We didn't see any ghosts but can vouch for there being some steep hills. We ate the best burger we ever had at the Haunted Hamburger (<a href=\"http://thehauntedhamburger.com\" title=\"\">thehauntedhamburger.com</a>) on Clark&nbsp;Street. <a href=\"http://azjerome.com/\" title=\"\"><em>azjerome.com</em></a> <br />skymancloudnine</p><h2>East coast</h2><p><strong>New Jersey Shore</strong><br />The Jersey Shore is under an hour from New York by ferry. Explore the lovely small towns, from Wildwood with its two-mile boardwalk, 1950s architecture and sweeping beaches, to Long Beach Island, with towns such as Ship Bottom and Loveladies. My favourite is Asbury Park – you can always hope Bruce Springsteen turns up for an impromptu gig at the Stone Pony (<a href=\"http://www.stoneponyonline.com/\" title=\"\">stoneponyonline.com</a>).<br /><a href=\"http://www.newjerseyshore.com\" title=\"\"><em>newjerseyshore.com</em></a><br /><strong>troutiemcfish</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397636383'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/10/1349873487046/Cooperstown-001.jpg' alt='Cooperstown' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cooperstown, New York</strong><br />Cooperstown is a picture perfect town two hours' drive from Manhattan and home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (<a href=\"http://baseballhall.org/\" title=\"\">baseballhall.org</a>).

The park is fed with cold spring water from the Comal river: you can rent a tube and float downriver for hours. For food try Schobels, on the banks of the Guadalupe river. It is an all-you-can-eat home-style buffet. German pastries and coffee are best at Naegelin's Bakery (<a href=\"http://naegelins.com/\" title=\"\">naegelins.com</a>) on the historic town square.

Lynchburg itself  retains enough soul and style to offer a sense of real small town America. Its pretty square with red brick courthouse and porched shops even has a dinky gas station.

In the mid-1800s, when it was established, gold miners thought it was the remains of a volcanic crater. It wasn't, but the name stuck. One popular attraction is the four-acre farm of Daffodil Hill (<a href=\"http://www.daffodilfestivals.com/insidetemp.php?festid=1359\" title=\"\">daffodilfestivals.com</a>).
