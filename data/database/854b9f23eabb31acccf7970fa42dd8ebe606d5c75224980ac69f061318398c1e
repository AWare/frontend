The fall is symbolic of the falls of Lucifer, Adam, Napoleon and Parnell, and indeed the Fall of man. It is also the fall of Humpty Dumpty and Isaac Newton’s apple. An apple represents the fruit that the snake tempted Eve to eat. A ladder itself is symbolic of both falling and rising.

He finds the overripe gripes (grapes) wrapped around a tree by the edge of a ‘boggylooking stream’. Above them is Nuvoletta, as a cloud on a balcony, spraying mist: ‘Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could’. The fable is essentially about the conflict between Catholic and non-Catholic churches, with the Mookse as Pope and the Gripes as anybody who will not submit to the Pope.

The fall is symbolic of the falls of Lucifer, Adam, Napoleon and Parnell, and indeed the Fall of man. It is also the fall of Humpty Dumpty and Isaac Newton’s apple.

The Mookse and the Gripes</b><br/>\r\nThis tale, told by Shaun, is based on the fable of The Fox and the Grapes. The Mookse is represented by Pope Adrian IV (Nicholas Brakespear, or ‘Bragspear’), the only English Pope. He is sitting on a stone, ‘pompifically’. He finds the overripe gripes (grapes) wrapped around a tree by the edge of a ‘boggylooking stream’. Above them is Nuvoletta, as a cloud on a balcony, spraying mist: ‘Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could’. The fable is essentially about the conflict between Catholic and non-Catholic churches, with the Mookse as Pope and the Gripes as anybody who will not submit to the Pope. The Gripes is also a representation of Shem, with Shaun as the Mookse. Their arguments descend into insults, and the two arguers eventually metamorphose into an apron and a handkerchief on the bank of the river Liffey.","width":"400"}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680858155/John-Vernon-Lord-2014-for-003-thumb-5128.jpg","typeData":{"source":"John Vernon Lord","altText":"Finnegans Wake: John Vernon Lord 2014 for Finnegans Wake","height":"68","credit":"John Vernon Lord/ The Folio Society","caption":"John Vernon Lord 2014 for Finnegans Wake\rThe Folio Society edition of Finnegans Wake by James Joyce, introduced by David Greetham and illustrated by John Vernon Lord, £99","width":"68"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-432874744","relation":"gallery","type":"image","galleryIndex":6,"assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680877844/John-Vernon-Lord-2014-for-011.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","altText":"Finnegans Wake: John Vernon Lord 2014 for Finnegans Wake","height":"598","credit":"John Vernon Lord/ The Folio Society","caption":"<b>5.

It appears that whilst Shem prepared the ‘ink’ he chanted ‘fermented words’, possibly 'Lingua mea calamus scribae velociter scribentis', which is from Psalm 45:1, ‘My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.’ This is represented in my version of a twelfth-century psalter illumination from St Albans.
