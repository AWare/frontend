In this extract from his new book, Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett explains the link between motion and vomiting","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Modern humans spend a lot more time sitting down than any previous generation. Manual labour jobs have largely been replaced by office jobs; cars and other means of transport allow us to travel while sitting down. This has its downsides. Obscene sums are spent on ergonomically designed office chairs to ensure people don’t get damaged or injured due to excessive sitting. Sitting too long on an aeroplane can even be fatal, due to deep vein thrombosis. It seems odd, but staying very still is bad for us.</p> <p>Because moving is important. Humans are good at it and we do it a lot, as evidenced by the fact that, as a species, we’ve pretty much covered the surface of the Earth, and actually been to the moon. Our skeletons have evolved to allow long periods of walking, as the arrangement and properties of our feet, legs, hips and general body layout are ideally suited to regular ambulation. But if moving is integral to our wellbeing and survival, why does it sometimes make us throw up?</p> <p>This is the phenomenon known as motion sickness or travel sickness. Sometimes, often apropos of nothing, being in transit makes us bring up our breakfast, lose our lunch, or eject some other more recent but non-alliterative meal. It is the brain that is actually responsible for this, not the stomach or innards (despite how it may feel at the time). What possible reason could there be for our brains to conclude, in defiance of aeons of evolution, that going from A to B is a legitimate cause for vomiting? In actual fact, the brain isn’t defying our evolved tendencies at all.</p> <p>It is the numerous systems and mechanisms we have to facilitate motion that are causing the problem. Motion sickness occurs only when you’re travelling by artificial means – in a vehicle. Humans have a sophisticated array of senses and neurological mechanisms that give rise to proprioception: the ability to sense how our body is currently arranged, and which parts are going where. There is also the vestibular system, found in our inner ear. It is a bunch of fluid-filled canals that detect our balance and position. There is enough space in there for fluid to move about in response to gravity, and there are neurons throughout it that can detect the location and arrangement of the fluids, letting our brain know our current position and orientation.</p> <p>Human motion produces a very specific set of signals. There is the steady up-down rocking motion inherent in bipedal walking, the general velocity and the external forces that this produces. All these are detected by proprioception and the vestibular system. The image hitting our eyes is one of the outside world going by. The same image could be caused either by us moving, or by us staying still and the outside world going past. At the most basic level, both are valid interpretations. How does the brain know which is right? It receives the visual information, couples it with the information from the fluid system in the ear and concludes: “Body is moving; this is normal.” Our eyes and inner systems work together to explain what’s going on.</p> <p>Movement via a vehicle produces a different set of sensations. When you are being transported, you’re not the one actually “doing” the moving; you’re just sitting there. Your proprioception isn’t producing all those clever signals for the brain to comprehend what is going on. But you are actually moving, and the aforementioned fluids in your ear, responding to the forces caused by high-speed movement and acceleration, are sending signals to the brain saying you are travelling, and quite fast at that. The brain is getting mixed signals from a precisely calibrated motion-detection system, and it is believed that this is what causes motion sickness. </p> <p>The deeper, more fundamental subconscious systems that regulate our bodies don’t really know how to deal with such internal problems as this, and they have no idea what could possibly be happening. In fact, as far as the reptile brain is concerned, there is only one likely answer: poison. In nature, that is the only likely thing that can so deeply affect our inner workings and cause them to get so confused. Poison is bad, and if the brain thinks there is poison in the body, there is only one reasonable response: get rid of it, activate the vomiting reflex, pronto.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

A man reflects on love and sex in this extract from Chilean poet Enrique Winter’s new work, Bin Bags","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Every morning Brian is in the habit of washing his arsehole with balsam, the way Eugenio used to like it. The upstairs bathroom is also shared, but it’s kept clean enough, because of the big window and because he’s included in a rota that the girls on that floor had inherited from other girls. He lathers his legs, the hair’s growing back, and he asks himself how something so obvious – that if you love someone you never stop loving them, dead or alive – is mentioned neither by the people giving the advice nor by those taking it. When you’ve loved someone, you’ll always love them. That’s all there is to it. He closes his eyes to rinse himself off. You can survive with that, with or without your loved ones. You don’t replace them, you add to them. He dries himself, some parts better shaven than others, and the towel keeps Eugenio at the forefront of his mind:<strong> </strong>once, Eugenio, when he was wrapped in a towel, said he made people see what they didn’t know they didn’t want to see. Brian then demanded an explanation and Eugenio spoke at length while he got dressed about how he provoked people who swore they were as liberal as can be.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter whether they were men or women, he had always liked the bad ones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Brian could spend a long time sitting with his eyes fixed on the back of Eugenio’s knees, while he was stood cooking. They were always the beginning of something and Eugenio let him look – with one foot he could stroke his calf as though itching it, or straighten out his shorts with one hand without taking the other off the frying pan or plate or whatever it was. He would whistle or sing slowly, and Brian heard the tune as though it was coming directly from those knees, bending every now and again, hinting at the thighs beyond, which he wouldn’t see until later. But Brian would always touch them through Eugenio’s shorts without even getting up from the sofa they had in the kitchen. With just his nails or his fingertips, he’d trace the edges of his boxer shorts until he was told to stop. But that didn’t always happen, and sometimes the tap would be left running or the water would evaporate on the hob. When they’d finished fucking, Brian would become quite the chatterbox, and Eugenio would half listen from the kitchen, in his dressing gown. They never got dressed afterwards, even though it might be noon. And so Brian would recount from the bed how when he was younger he wrote down all his first kisses in his diary, believing he would be able to record them for the rest of his life, which Eugenio thought was cute, or how no matter whether they were men or women he had always liked the bad ones. Brian remembered the ones who would wait up the whole night without asking where you’d been, who would bring you chocolates, marzipan, remember everything you told them and ask how such-and-such a thing had gone last week, last month, if you weren’t a morning person they’d slide into your bed to wake you up, or, if they were sleeping with you, would wait until you woke up before leaving. There was one who was so good to him, really optimistic, smiling, but Brian wasn’t in love with him. It took him a long time to figure out whether he was only with him because he was a good guy – if he hadn’t looked after me so well I would have left him like a shot, he confessed to Eugenio, and Eugenio agreed – or, worse, whether he didn’t fall in love with him precisely because he was such a good guy. The reason he wanted him – I wouldn’t have let myself be the first to invite him for an ice cream or to dance, I don’t even remember how I met him, but I hadn’t liked him beforehand, that’s for sure – the reason he wanted him was perhaps the same reason he didn’t love him, the reason it started was the same reason it ended. I was suffocated, d’you get me, by wanting to love him, but it wasn’t his fault, not even when I was a little brat and went out secretly with the neighbour, do you remember Elder?</p> <p> “Yes! A waste of space that guy, but I don’t understand why you still go for the bad ones now,” Eugenio asked him once, less distracted than usual. </p> <p> “I dunno, because I’m one of the good ones, I guess, right?”</p> <p> “All you are is <em>loco – </em>and mind, because they beat <em>locos</em> round here.”</p> <p> Eugenio’s response to other questions varied between treating him like a submissive, pretending to lash him with a whip, and saying “<em>locos</em> aren’t in season otherwise I’d eat them with lemon like <em>choros</em> or any other seafood,” when he wouldn’t lay off his ridiculous attempt to distinguish between good and bad people, as if life was a soap opera. </p> <p> Eugenio would also tell him what was on his mind, though he wouldn’t wait until after they’d fucked to do so. At any moment he might come out and say that he had a choice between living with someone who teased him and someone who satisfied him. When Brian asked him whether he teased or satisfied him, Eugenio didn’t answer, but snuggled up to him<strong> </strong>until he forgot what they had been talking about, just like when he brought up being short of money, or whether he’d been out whoring when Brian was at work, or when Eugenio would disappear for a couple of days and come back with no explanation, sometimes with bruises hidden underneath make up. But he couldn’t hide them from Brian’s eyes, his eyes seemed made for those knees, they tessellated.</p> <p><em>Translated from the Spanish by Ellen Jones</em></p> <p><em>*****</em></p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Enrique Winter</strong> (Santiago, Chile, 1982) is author of </em>Atar las naves<em> (winner of Víctor Jara Arts Festival), </em>Rascacielos<em> (available in English as </em><a href=\"http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/product/skyscrapers-enrique-winter-d%C3%ADazgrey-editores-new-book-translated-mary-ellen-stitt\">Skyscrapers</a><em>), </em>Guía de despacho<em> (winner of the National Young Poet Competition), </em>Lengua de señas<em> (Pablo de Rokha Poetry Prize; available in English as </em><a href=\"http://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2016/02/04/in-review-sign-tongue-by-enrique-winter/\">Sign Tongue</a><em>) and co-author of the LP </em>Agua en polvo<em>, collected in several anthologies and languages.

In this extract from his new book, Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett explains the chemical processes behind the heartbreak","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Have you ever found yourself in the foetal position on the sofa for days on end, curtains drawn, phone unanswered, moving only to haphazardly wipe the snot and tears from your face? All that has happened is you’ve been made aware that you won’t be seeing a person you had a lot of interaction with much any more. That’s it. So why does it leave you reeling for weeks, months, even for the rest of your life, in some cases?</p> <p>Humans seem primed to seek out and form monogamous romantic relationships, and this is reflected in a number of weird things the brain does when we end up falling for someone. Attraction is governed by many factors. Many species develope secondary sex characteristics, which are features that occur during sexual maturity but that aren’t directly involved in the reproductive process; for instance, a moose’s antlers or a peacock’s tail. They are impressive and show how fit and healthy the individual creature is, but they don’t do much beyond that. </p> <p>Humans are no different. As adults, we develop many features that are apparently largely for physically attracting others: the deep voice, enlarged frames and facial hair of men, or the protruding breasts and pronounced curves of women. None of these things are “essential”, but in the distant past, some of our ancestors decided that is what they wanted in a partner, and evolution took over from there. But then we end up with something of a chicken-and-egg scenario with regards to the brain, in that the human brain inherently finds certain features attractive because it has evolved to do so. Which came first, the attraction or the primitive brain’s recognition of it? Hard to say.</p> <p>It is important, however, to differentiate between a desire for sex, AKA lust, and the deeper, more personal attraction and bonding we associate with romance and love, things more often sought and found with long-term relationships. People can (and frequently do) enjoy purely physical sexual interactions with others that they have no real “fondness” for apart from an appreciation for their appearance, and even that is not essential. Sex is a tricky thing to pin down with the brain, as it underlies much of our adult thinking and behaviour. </p> <p>But this isn’t really about lust; we’re talking more about love, in the romantic sense, for one specific individual. There is a lot of evidence to suggest the brain processes love differently. Studies by Bartels and Zeki suggest that when individuals who describe themselves as in love are shown images of their romantic partners, there is raised activity (not seen in lust or more platonic relationships) in a network of brain regions including the medial insula, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus and putamen. </p> <p>There is also lower activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala. The posterior cingulate gyrus is often associated with painful emotion perception, so it makes sense that your loved one’s presence would shut this down a bit. The amygdala processes emotions and memory, but often for negative things such as fear and anger, so again, it makes sense that it’s not so active now. People in committed relationships can often seem more relaxed and less bothered about day-to-day annoyances, regularly coming across as “smug” to the independent observer.</p> <p>One type of chemical often associated with attraction are pheromones, specific substances given off in sweat that other individuals detect and that alter their behaviour. While human pheromones are regularly referred to (you can seemingly buy sprays laced with them if you’re looking to increase your sexual appeal), there is currently no definitive evidence that humans have specific pheromones that influence attraction and arousal. The brain may often be an idiot, but it is not so easily manipulated.</p> <p>However, being in love seems to elevate dopamine activity in the reward pathway, meaning we experience pleasure in our partner’s presence, almost like a drug. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2012/apr/09/pass-notes-oxytocin\">oxytocin is often referred to as the “love hormone”</a> or similar, which is a ridiculous oversimplification of a complex substance, but it does seem to be elevated in people in relationships, and it has been linked to feelings of trust and connection in humans.</p> <p>The flexibility of the brain means that, in response to all this deep and intense stuff, it adapts to expect it. And then it ends. Consider everything the brain invests in sustaining a relationship, all the changes it undergoes, all the value it places on being in one. If you remove all this in one fell swoop, the brain is going to be seriously negatively affected. All the positive sensations it has grown to expect suddenly cease, which is incredibly distressing for an organ that doesn’t deal with uncertainty and ambiguity well at all. Studies have shown that a relationship breakup activates the same brain regions that process physical pain.</p> <p>Addiction and withdrawal can be very disruptive and damaging to the brain, and a not dissimilar process is happening here. This isn’t to say the brain doesn’t have the ability to deal with a breakup. It can put everything back together eventually, even if it’s a slow process. Some experiments showed that specifically focusing on the positive outcomes of a breakup can cause more rapid recovery and growth. And, just sometimes, science and cliches match up, and things really do get better with time.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

But according to John Updike, “Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset … that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible”.</p> <p>Now the designer and writer Matt Steel is setting out to address Walden’s declining readership, with a new edition of the public domain text that adapts Thoreau’s 19th-century language for modern readers. Steel <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2001070129/the-new-walden\">launched a Kickstarter</a> to raise funds for his project on Tuesday, aiming to raise $104,000 (£72,000) to print 2,000 cloth hardback, illustrated copies of his adapted version. The finished book is due out in spring 2017 if the campaign is successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to shorten the distance between 1854 and today so that the lyrical beauty of this excellent text can shine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“While widely quoted, Walden is rarely read anymore, and our society’s familiarity with the story is fading,” Steel said. “My theory is that there’s nothing wrong with the story. It’s the 19th-century language that’s problematic. By creating an updated version of Walden, I want to create more opportunities for other people’s lives to be enriched by this book.”</p> <p>When Steel himself first read the book, in 2014, it had “a profound impact” on him, he said. “Having gone through a period of career burnout, followed by radical lifestyle change, I could see that Thoreau’s ideas around simplicity, consumerism, and busy-ness had an uncanny relevance to the challenges we face today. I shared my enthusiasm for the book with anyone willing to listen. But I kept having to couch my recommendations: ‘This is an incredible book, but the 19th-century language is hard to digest at times. But stick with it, and you’ll be glad you did!’ This situation bothered me. I didn’t want to keep telling people they should read Walden – ‘but …’. I realised that what this story needs is to be updated for modern readers.”</p> <p>His new version neither abridges nor “dumb[s] down” Thoreau’s original text, he says. “A lot of the pleasure in reading Walden is Thoreau’s language. Walden has always been a dense, layered text. I think that’s part of what makes it a feast for the mind,” said Steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d02f97a2a49f450ce37e7cc4586c4f9d82fc47\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f5d02f97a2a49f450ce37e7cc4586c4f9d82fc47/109_0_3597_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pond for the 21st century ... a comparison of the language of the original and the new versions of Walden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pond for the 21st century ... a comparison of the language of the original and the new versions of Walden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vann Alexandra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“To that end, I am not revising Walden to the point of removing any of Thoreau’s ideas or adding my own. I have no wish to impose my style or opinions on such a celebrated author. But I believe the degree to which the English language has changed over the past two centuries has made it harder for readers to get into this particular text. And because Walden was such a complex, layered work to begin with, and because of its ongoing relevance, it seemed particularly ripe for an update ... I want to shorten the distance between 1854 and today as much as possible, so that the lyrical beauty, wisdom, and power of this excellent text can shine.”</p> <p>Examples of the changes he has made include translations of Latin and Greek references, updated archaisms (“I would fain” becomes “I wish”), changes to outdated place names, and splitting Thoreau’s lengthy sentences up. He has also switched “men” for “people” throughout, when Thoreau is referring to humanity as a whole. The new version is sprinkled with pull quotes highlighting Thoreau’s “powerful one-liners”, such as “could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other’s eyes for an instant?” And at the end, a selection of the author’s “most arresting passages” are presented as prose poems.</p> <p>Steel has worked with the editor and poet <a href=\"http://talkinginthedark.com/\">Billy Merrell</a> on the text, and says that so far, much of the feedback from the literary community has been “delight and enthusiasm”. “A couple have been very sceptical. I’m sure that there will be strong reactions as more people discover this project,” said Steel. “I invite sceptics to read the original and my version side by side and then judge for themselves … I want people to know that I don’t intend to replace the original version of Walden. My version may serve as a replacement for some people, or a first-and-only version for others. But I see the two versions living side by side. If this project helps preserve Thoreau’s beautiful words and introduces him to new audiences, then I’ve done my job.”</p> <p>Should the Kickstarter prove successful, Steel envisages adapting other classics. “The loss of accessibility in books has been going on for millennia, as has the practice of updating them in order to prevent their disappearance. But I think we tend to wait too long. With this project, I hope to show the benefits of shortening revision cycles. I believe this will allow the world’s best stories to remain evergreen,” he said.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gnjm","wordcount":"958","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/236a13d12243fab89c8de776d372a50963d5431b/0_596_3000_1798/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Henry

But, in very specific circumstances, it can actually help recall. This is the phenomenon known as state-specific recall. External context can help you recall a memory; you’re better able to recall it if you are in the same environment where the memory was acquired. But, and here’s the clever bit, this also applies to the internal context, or “state”, hence state-dependent recall. To put it simply, substances such as alcohol or stimulants or anything that alters brain activity bring about a specific neurological state. When the brain is suddenly having to deal with a disruptive substance washing around everywhere, this does not go unnoticed, any more than you wouldn’t notice that your bedroom was suddenly full of smoke.</p> <p>This can also apply to mood: if you learn something while in a bad mood, you’re more likely to recall it later if you’re in a bad mood again. It is a massive oversimplification to describe moods and mood disorders as “chemical imbalances” in the brain (despite many who do just that), but the overall levels of chemical and electrochemical activity that result in and from a specific mood is something the brain can recognise, and does. Thus, the context inside your head is potentially just as useful as the one outside your head when it comes to triggering memories.</p> <p>Alcohol does disrupt memories, but only after a certain point; it’s perfectly possible to have the pleasant buzz of a few beers or glasses of wine and still remember everything the next day. But if you were to be told some interesting gossip or useful information after a couple of glasses of wine, your brain would encode your slightly intoxicated state as part of the memory, so would be better able to retrieve this memory if you were to have another couple of glasses of wine (on a different night, not right after the first two). In this scenario, a glass of wine can indeed improve your memory.<br /></p> <p>Please don’t take this as a scientific endorsement for drinking heavily when studying for exams or tests. Turning up drunk for a test will be problematic enough to cancel out any minor memory advantages this provides you with, especially if it’s a driving test.</p> <p>But there is still some hope for desperate students: caffeine affects the brain and produces a specific internal state that can help trigger memories, and a lot of students pull caffeine-fuelled all-nighters when cramming for exams. So if you attend the exams similarly stimulated by excessive caffeine, then it could well help with remembering some of the more important details from your notes.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

It was on a family holiday after I’d run out of my own reading material (this was in the days pre-kindle, when you had to ration the suitcase space you gave to books). I found a tattered copy of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/death-in-the-clouds-2.html\">Death in the Clouds</a>, the one with a picture of a coffee cup on the cover, a dead bee crumpled on the saucer. Something about that bee sent a little thrill down my spine and I hurried back to my room before someone told me to put it down. I read the book in one sitting and became a murder mystery addict and an avid Hercule Poirot fan.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8eb0e27450aea01f62f1214e8cecceca495ea3b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f8eb0e27450aea01f62f1214e8cecceca495ea3b/0_929_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Rubin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Rubin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Poirot is an odd sort of hero, nothing like the rugged detective I was expecting. He isn’t strong or daring. He doesn’t carry a gun or chase after criminals in the night. Instead he is small, only five foot four, and walks with a mincing step. He likes things to be orderly, keeping his rooms at Whitehaven Mansions spotless, his books organised by height. He’s forever tidying and straightening and looking distastefully at dust. I can remember giggling as Poirot mourned the ruination of his patent leather shoes as he trudged along a beach to view a body, his discomfort diluting the bloodiness of the scene.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“It is enough for me to sit back in my chair and think.”</p> </blockquote> <p> Poirot is vain and egotistical, but despite being the opposite of an action hero, he never fails to save the day. As he says in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/five-little-pigs.html\">The Five Little Pigs</a><em>, “</em>I do not need to bend and measure the footprints and pick up the cigarette ends and examine the bent blades of grass. It is enough for me to sit back in my chair and think.” From the comfort of his armchair, Poirot assembles the pieces of a crime like an intricate puzzle and then displays the solution, exposing the criminal to justice. Reading Death in the Clouds, it struck me that, even though I was just a child, if I could learn to use my own little grey cells, I could be just as much of a detective as Poirot.</p> <p> It was a striking thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/15/my-inspiration-lauren-child-alfred-hitchcock-ruby-redfort\">My  inspiration: Lauren Child on Alfred Hitchcock</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I can often remember feeling powerless as a child. When you’re 10 you are not the master of your own fate. Homework must be done. Beds must be made. Dinners must be eaten. Because I was small I had to do as I was told. Poirot showed me a different kind of power. He showed me that the best way to get the better of someone (even if you are a child and they are an adult) is to out-think them. When I started to write Alice Jones: The Impossible Clue, I knew Alice had to be smart just like Poirot. She was up against some very devious and grown-up bad guys, and the best weapon I could give her was a razor sharp mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/15/top-10-agatha-christie-novels\">The top 10 Agatha Christie mysteries</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Alice’s take on Order and Method comes from her love of maths. Where Poirot sees mysteries as puzzles, Alice sees them as equations: “Mysteries are a lot like maths, word problems specifically. Some are simple, some are complicated, but it’s the same process. There’s something you want to know, and a lot of information swimming around. The hard part is coming up with the right equation, figuring out what bits of information are important and what bits are just there to confuse you. Then it’s just a matter of solving for X.”</p> <p> Of course, Alice is a bit more reckless than Poirot, and he definitely wouldn’t approve of her fashion sense, or riding around Philadelphia on a bike (<em>quelle horreur</em>), but the reason she can crack the case is because of her methodical mind. Poirot would be the first to congratulate her on her excellent choice of mentor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cf7da26529a01e8fd80a22f08e9e0286f9f16e22\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cf7da26529a01e8fd80a22f08e9e0286f9f16e22/0_0_1533_2364/648.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Jones The Impossible Clue\" width=\"648\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Alice Jones: The Impossible Clue</strong><strong> by Sarah Rubin out now in paperback (£6.99, Chicken House). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/367882/\">Buy it at the Guardian bookshop</a>.</strong></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ggn2","wordcount":"682","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/917a4f1b3c516836cadd1a72f960deb83ab88fdb/0_55_3504_2102/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>Author Sarah Rubin fell in love with Hercule Poirot’s mind at the age of 10.

But they might make you live a little longer.</p> <p><strong>Because in my friend’s book club, everybody drinks enough wine to fell an elephant.</strong> It’s only true if you’re part of a certain demographic.</p> <p><strong>Explain yourself.</strong> <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/2/e010164.full?sid=8cb77b19-ec32-4851-ae68-b533dc25294a\">According to results published this week in BMJ Open</a>, a UK medical journal, people enjoy healthier lives if they maintain social bonds after they retire. Something like a book club, where you regularly meet friends and chat, can significantly reduce your risk of death in the first six years post-retirement.</p> <p><strong>So it’s the social interaction that keeps you alive, not the book club itself? </strong>That’s right. You could also be a member of a sporting club or a church society.</p> <p><strong>So I wouldn’t actually have to read the books?</strong> I suppose not. Like you said, it’s the social interaction that counts.</p> <p><strong>So I could just memorise the book’s Wikipedia summary on the way there and I’d still live longer?</strong> Listen, I’m not really sure you’re fully grasping the point …</p> <p><strong>I hate books.</strong> You’re weird.</p> <p><strong>How else can I live longer?</strong> Well, the study is all about the negative effects of social isolation in the elderly, and how it can increase the risk of dementia or cognitive decline. And one thing that can stop social isolation is …</p> <p><strong>Don’t say it.</strong> Formal employment.</p> <p><strong>Goddamn it. </strong>Sorry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/02/the-rise-of-the-alternative-book-club\">The rise of the alternative book club</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So that’s my choice, then? Work for ever or read boring books?</strong> No, that isn’t your choice at all. If you’ve just retired, you should try to remain as active as you possibly can. Maintaining strong social relationships with likeminded people is important for your health, but you can achieve this in a number of ways. It doesn’t have to be a book club.</p> <p><strong>What about if I started an I Hate Books club? </strong>I suppose that could also work, if you found enough people to join.</p> <p><strong>I definitely would.

Oxfordshire","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Two poems by JRR Tolkien, in which The Lord of the Rings author writes variously of “a man who dwelt alone/beneath the moon in shadow”, and of the “lord of snows”, have been discovered in a school magazine in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.</p> <p>Believed to have been written while Tolkien was professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, the poems were found in the 1936 annual of Our Lady’s School in Oxfordshire. The discovery was made when the US Tolkien scholar Wayne Hammond contacted Our Lady’s headteacher, Stephen Oliver. Hammond had found a note from Tolkien in which The Hobbit author mentioned that he had published two poems in a magazine he named as the Abingdon Chronicle.</p> <p>Hammond realised this was Our Lady’s school magazine, and got in touch with Oliver. Initially, the latter could not locate the correct edition of the magazine, and passed Hammond on to the archives of the Sisters of Mercy, who had founded the school in 1860.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cec61ab4f3138c764f9eeedb18025b840be935b6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cec61ab4f3138c764f9eeedb18025b840be935b6/12_0_2386_3264/731.jpg\" alt=\"The 1936 annual of Our Lady’s School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, which contains two newly discovered poems by JRR Tolkien\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1936 annual of Our Lady’s School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Our Lady’s School</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Then, while preparing for an event for former pupils of the school, we uncovered our own copy and I saw the two poems Mr Hammond had been looking for. My excitement when I saw them was overwhelming. I am a great Tolkien fan and was thrilled to discover the connection with the school,” said Oliver.</p> <p>The first poem, The Shadow Man, is an early version of a poem that Tolkien went on to publish in his 1962 collection <a href=\"http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Bombadil\">The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</a>. It tells of “a man who dwelt alone/ beneath the moon in shadow”, who “sat as long as lasting stone,/and yet he had no shadow”. When “a lady clad in grey” arrives, he wakes, and “clasped her fast, both flesh and bone;/and they were clad in shadow”.</p> <p>The second, Noel, is a Christmas poem, albeit one set in scenery that would not be out of place in Middle-earth. “The hall was dark without song or light,/The fires were fallen dead,” writes Tolkien, going on to portray “the lord of snows”, whose “mantle long and pale/Upon the bitter blast was spread/And hung o’er hill and dale”.</p> <p>The school is now planning to show the poems at an exhibition about its history. “Both poems are very atmospheric and imbued with an air of mystery. I was very moved when I first read them,” said Oliver.</p> <p>“Noel is a beautiful and unusual take on the Christmas story, set in a wintry landscape. The focus is on Mary, which may be why Tolkien wrote the poem for the school magazine, given that we are dedicated to Our Lady. The Shadow Man is also a very beautiful story, about two people finding each other and thereafter casting only one shadow – it feels like a poem about marriage. The Shadow Man is incomplete until a woman comes to him and relieves his loneliness.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oliver is confident the poems “will be enjoyed by lovers of Tolkien everywhere”. Fans of the novelist have been given a wealth of previously unpublished material to enjoy in recent years, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/12/jrr-tolkiens-first-fantasy-story-to-be-published-this-month\">last year’s release</a> of his retelling of the Finnish epic poem The Story of Kullervo, to the unfinished Middle-earth story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/jrrtolkien.fiction\">The Children of Húrin</a>. David Brawn, Tolkien’s publisher at HarperCollins, said that some unpublished poetry had been included in the revised edition of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil in 2014, and that “there is often scope to add rare material to future revised editions”.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /> </p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gng8","wordcount":"579","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6c471ef9ac85a989b44230462c43b1e0dd631eb/0_105_4095_2459/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Two works by the Lord of the Rings author discovered in the 1936 annual of Our Lady’s School in Oxfordshire</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/16/unseen-jrr-tolkien-poems-found-in-school-magazine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/16/unseen-jrr-tolkien-poems-found-in-school-magazine","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"a6c471ef9ac85a989b44230462c43b1e0dd631eb","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6c471ef9ac85a989b44230462c43b1e0dd631eb/0_105_4095_2459/2000.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*30296300","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/a6c471ef9ac85a989b44230462c43b1e0dd631eb","suppliersReference":"01x/48/diry/15197/29u","altText":"JRR Tolkien.","caption":"‘These poems will be enjoyed by lovers of Tolkien everywhere’ ...

not to admire","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>After a week spent discussing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/09/can-homers-iliad-speak-across-the-centuries\">the challenges the Iliad presents modern readers</a>, I’m going to try for something more positive. I say “try” because if there’s one thing that reading ancient Greek literature has taught me, it is to beware of hubris. If I were to try to list all the things that I think matter about this book it might well result in a list as long as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Ships\">the catalogue of the ships</a>. Instead, I’d like to focus on just one aspect of the poem: the man who gets its first line and whose wrath sets it all in motion, Achilles.</p> <p>Achilles does not fit modern sensibilities. He is a killer, arguably a rapist, certainly a pillager. He is sulky, high-strung and oh boy, is he temperamental. He can be pitiless – actively enjoying the iron in his heart – and he can be murderously cruel. Yet there is still something fundamental about him to which we can all relate, even if it is also something particularly hard to rationalise and explain. He is faster, sharper, bigger, brighter and more important than other men. He is more beautiful. He rides on deeper emotional currents (when Achilles is upset, he is <em>seriously</em> upset<em>)</em>. He is semi-divine and wholly precious. Other men cannot even aspire to be like him. At his most resplendent, men cannot even bear to look at him. He is just above and beyond.</p> <p>Achilles in short, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwS66EBUcY\">a hero</a> and taps into a need that most of us have to worship and admire. I was recently listening to a very good <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/travel-study/id385779234?mt=10\">Stanford lecture about the Iliad by Marsh McCall</a>, where the genial professor suggests that baseball and American football players play a similar role in modern society. There is also a fantastic <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fcfootbole/videos/681992685276391/\">video of kids meeting their football idols</a>, viewed more than 69m times on social media, which gives an idea of how primal and overpowering such reverence can be.</p> <p>To speak personally, I don’t feel much beyond the usual admiration for sports players. I also like to think of myself as rational and keen to judge on actual merit and not mythology. But I’m far from immune to the appeal of the hero, and I imagine few people are. One of the many laments I could relate to, for instance, following the recent loss of David Bowie was the simple expression of incredulity that death could catch even him, that someone who had seemed so much bigger than life should actually have to go.</p> <p>This human need to venerate was something Homer understood and exploited to glorious effect in the Iliad. Most obviously, and brilliantly, he does this by keeping Achilles off the scene. In the first line of the Iliad, Homer may ask the muses to sing about the wrath of Achilles – but the man himself <a href=\"http://mythagora.com/bios/achillestext.html#iliad\">appears in the poem surprisingly rarely</a>. Homer is careful to give him mainly the big moments – the beginning, the climax, and a few crucial turning points. There are books and books in which he is barely mentioned. But, of course, all the time he is off the scene, his presence only grows. Every other feat of arms, every brutal kill, every spear cast invokes a comparison to the absent hero – and is inevitably found wanting. We know that, even at his most terrible and shining, Hector would not have a hope against Achilles. We know that, big as he may be, Ajax’s achievements are dwarfed by the demigod. We know, saddest of all, that Patroclus is but a shadow of his great friend, the armour he has borrowed from him is an all but empty shell, and that where Achilles would sweep all before him, he is doomed to fall. All the killing, all the struggle, all the pain – all is made futile because we know that if Achilles were on the scene it would turn out differently.</p> <p>This trick works especially well because when Achilles does return to the field of battle, he does so with (literally) god-given style. First in a blaze of glory and accompanied by the terrifying screech of the goddess Thetis. Next, wrapped up in the astonishing armour Hephaestus gave him, burning with fury and effortlessly smiting anyone who stands before him.</p> <p>Yet it isn’t just Achilles’ supernatural power that makes him such a compelling hero. It’s also his fallibility. Three thousand years ago, just as today, hero worship had to have its negative aspect – the hands reaching up to drag the star from the podium, the mistakes that make the successes seem all the more remarkable. In among all the adoring articles about Bowie, there were a good number of attempts at muckraking. Likewise for many a sporting idol.</p> <p>Achilles, too, has to spend his time in the muck. One of the most famous passages in the Iliad comes at the start of Book 18, when Achilles learns that his beloved companion Patroclus has been killed by Hector, stripped of his armour (the very armour Achilles lent him before he sent him off to battle) and that Trojans and Achaeans are now fighting over his naked corpse. A dark cloud of grief shrouds the hero and, we are told, he defiles his handsome face with ashes from the fire and collapses, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/new-translation-of-the-iliad-by-caroline-alexander-extract\">as Caroline Alexander translates</a>, “outstretched in the dust, a great man in his greatness, and with his own hands he defiled his hair, tearing at it”. He’s at his most moving when he’s at his most human, prostrate, weeping, knowing he’s done the wrong thing, knowing that fate is going to pummel him as a result. Even at the height of his fury, Homer also takes the time to render Achilles helpless, sweeping him up in the river Skamander, reminding us that even he has limitations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/09/can-homers-iliad-speak-across-the-centuries\">Can Homer's Iliad speak across the centuries?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Homer doesn’t just beg our sympathy. We also see Achilles being bad. Above and beyond the aforementioned sulking, and those actions that don’t square with 21st-century morality, are outrages intolerable even in his battle-hardened society. No one, god or Greek, can approve of Achilles’ attempts to defile Hector’s corpse. But again, such actions are a mark of someone who just has to go that bit further, that bit madder with grief, that bit deeper into the maelstrom. What’s more, the troughs Achilles plumbs just make the heights seem all the more exalted. His calm enjoyment of the funeral games and level-headed generosity to the competitors, the sympathetic hearing he eventually grants poor old Priam – both seem all the more impressive after his previous derangement. The Iliad is a masterful investigation of a character whom we just can’t help but look up to: a lesson in charisma for any age.</p> <p>One final extra thought, while I’ve shied away from listing Homer’s other fine moments in this article, it might well be fun to compile some ideas in the comments. For starters, I’ll chuck in the fact that the poet <a href=\"http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad5.htm\">clearly loves lions</a>, throwing in references to their power and the way they move throughout the epic. And also how Nestor can be both an “in my day” bore and a brave, resolute man, making the moment Achilles offers him an award in his games feel both poignant and satisfyingly right. Oh, and poor old Hecuba … But that’s enough for now.

This book is only half its own story.</p> <p>I knew Hot Feminist would prove contentious when I wrote it. I didn’t write it for shock value alone; or even at all. Why <em>did </em>I write it? To present my version of feminism: wayward, ideologically impure, politically incorrect, un-academic, flawed to hell – and no less passionately held for all that. To ease any potential readers’ feminist guilt by exposing myself as more slapdash than they; to make a case for an ultimately inclusive movement, via the example of my own haphazard, clothes-, looks- and man-oriented adventures in feminism.</p> <p>I wanted to address feminism as a fashion writer, as someone deeply involved in that complicated, sometimes compromised world, with its myriad messages about women: who we should be, how we should look. I wanted to talk about feminism and sexiness; about how I don’t always mind being objectified by the male gaze, and how I am more than capable of objectifying back. I wanted to talk about my life, my experiences. Hot Feminist is a memoir. I believe a book that incorporates extensive fashion tips, alongside one woman’s experiences of abortion and of violent sexual assault, might make a point about the light and shade of the modern female’s life.<br /></p> <p>It was first published in May 2015; as I say, I anticipated a little contention. The book itself is honest and uncynical – but the title was calculated. Chosen to provoke. I wanted people to take notice and heaven knows, the reviewers did. In its first week, Hot Feminist inspired every imaginable critical response: five stars from one newspaper, a savaging from another. Everything in between from everyone else. Interest, relief, commendations for my humour; rage, rebuttals, airy assertions of my irrelevance. I shan’t pretend this was easy. But I think I could have survived it, if it hadn’t been for Twitter.</p> <p>While the reviewers were at odds about Hot Feminist, Twitter was united. My book and I instantly became the target of unbridled internet scorn.</p> <p>I wasn’t trolled. I was spared that violent, anonymous bile. What I got was casual contempt. All the attention came from women, all of whom identified as feminists, all of whom were keen to tell me how stupid my book and I were. How “vacuous”, “pointless”, “disgusting”, “moronic”. How “sickening”, “inane”, “bad”, “wrong”. They told me they hadn’t actually read Hot Feminist (though one of them was “tempted, just to see how crap it truly is”); then gleefully retweeted links to the most damning reviews. Misconstructions of the book’s premise abounded: “@pollyvernon thinks all feminists are ugly bra burners with hairy legs!” for example. Others focused on exposing me as dangerous, as triggering of their eating disorders or as too privileged to count.</p> <p>I don’t know how many I got – several hundred? Enough to make me feel outraged, battered, profoundly self-doubting. I tried to talk to them, to understand their anger, but this made them angrier yet. I tried fronting it out, but I couldn’t sustain the defence. I was promoting the book on TV and at festivals, wired on caffeine and adrenaline, not really eating, not really sleeping; checking Twitter compulsively. Four days after publication, I developed a facial twitch.</p> <p>It blew over a few days after that, but it left me a mess. Over the summer of 2015, I developed anxiety issues. Foul dreams; fantasies that strangers I passed in the street were poised to attack me. My self-confidence flatlined. I ducked writing commissions, because publishing seemed like a risky venture. I became convinced there was something very wrong with my face. Leaving my flat became – if not a major struggle, then certainly effortful. Life felt syrupy-heavy, the sky seemed claustrophobically low. I realised I’d become depressed, but didn’t understand why. I’d published the book I’d really wanted to write, everyone had talked about it. What did I have to be depressed about?</p> <p>I’d been destabilised by Twitter’s rush to shame me. Shame: such a distinct, old-fashioned – <em>old –</em> feeling. Exactly the sort of thing you might feel, if hundreds of disembodied voices turned on you, denounced you, shunned you.</p> <p>I got over it. It took time, friends, therapy, a couple more good reviews, quitting Twitter. Now? I’m fine. Almost completely restored.</p> <p>Almost. Because I do wonder if I’ll ever take such risks – publish anything as heartfelt, as exposing – again. Probably not. And I wonder who else is choosing not to say things they really mean, for fear of how Twitter will react.</p> <h2> Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a feminist, I keep my fury focused, pure and sincere, because to get angry about all the things, all the time – about every last transgression against womanhood, as perceived by all other women – is just not feasible. It’d confuse me and distract me, overwhelm me with a sense this is an unwinnable war of epic proportions.</p> <p>I would never tell another feminist which battles they should fight … But I defend my absolute right to not really be offended by a lot of things. It frees me up to care enormously about the things that do offend me. The things that do leave me genuinely, sincerely enraged; apoplectic, head-spinny, bile-spitting, and incredibly sweary – even by my own fundamentally foul-mouthed standards.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about Hot Feminist</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The whole marketing strategy of this book relies on winding people like me up; yet at the same time Vernon tries to pre-empt any

they absorb moisture through their rear ends; scorpions are useful household lodgers but honey-bees can be dangerous","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>You may have read the recent piece in this paper that asked if we should wipe mosquitoes – and particularly the Zika virus-spreading <em>Aedes aegypti</em> – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/10/should-we-wipe-mosquitoes-off-the-face-of-the-earth\" title=\"\">off the face of the planet</a>. It could be done, but there might well be side effects. Between 1958 and 1962, as <em>House Guests, House Pests</em> reminds us, the Chinese ran the Four Pests campaign, which strove to eradicate rats, mosquitoes, house flies and sparrows. Why sparrows? They were eating sown grain. People scared them off fields, shot them and destroyed their nests. Sparrow numbers nosedived but the insects on which they fed proliferated, and locusts began to ravage the crops.</p> <p>The book superbly executes an excellent idea: it explores the natural history of the animals that make their way into the home and their coexistence with us. Not all of these are undesirable. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/21/birdwatch-house-martin-migration\" title=\"\">House martins</a> are generally recognised as an adornment; farmers would build niches in their barns for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/02/unknowable-magic-owls\" title=\"\">owls</a> to nest in; and dogs and cats are welcomed everywhere except, I concede, by certain landlords. That said, a cat’s desire to kill mice sometimes takes second place to its desire to play with them sadistically, and Richard Jones suspects his own cat of bringing them in for just this purpose.</p> <p>Cats and dogs often bring in other unwanted guests, such as fleas. This is more like it, and it is to capitalise on the frisson of our disgust that the cover crawls with, well, creepy-crawlies, and not cats, dogs or the family budgie (which isn’t even mentioned, so as not to widen the remit too much. Gerbils do appear, in passing, when Jones tells us they are immune to flea-carried <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/bubonic-plague\" title=\"\">bubonic plague</a>, unlike rats; he speculates how history would have been different, and worse, had they been its carriers instead).</p> <p>A fellow of the <a href=\"http://www.royensoc.co.uk\" title=\"\">Royal Entomological Society</a>, Jones is a most engaging and informative host. But what would he be like to live with? As seems to be the case with many naturalists, he recognises only the flimsiest boundaries between what is and isn’t acceptable when it comes to letting your work’s passion interfere with the lives of those nearest to you. When introducing a section on useful predators in the home, such as scorpions, centipedes and spiders, he says “some caution should be exercised if, for the sake of family peace and calm, eviction is the only acceptable solution”, which we assume means that he’s had a scorpion in the house and has only got rid of it because everyone else has begged him to – and that perhaps he got stung into the bargain.</p> <p>You learn a lot in his company. If you find a feral <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees\" title=\"\">honey-bee</a> nest in your home (they are never wild, always feral, having only been introduced for deliberate cultivation), you are better off getting rid of it as you’re more likely to get stung than you would be with a wasp nest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/26/maevkennedy\" title=\"\">Silverfish</a> don’t drink: they absorb water from the atmosphere, up their bottoms, in case you were wondering. The acceptable rate of infestation of figs by worms is one in 10. And there is a lovely phrase I have learned: the septic fringe, referring to those rubbish tips at the nearest acceptable distance from our dwellings, both ancient and modern. It was here these beasties learned that humans, with their waste and dry, cavity-filled homes, were worth getting to know more intimately. There is only one real problem with this book, and that is that Jones writes with such knowledge and interest about each of the species he examines that you wish he had written much more.

Funny and poetic, highly subjective and slightly mad, Nairn’s great gift is for rendering the familiar unfamiliar.

Nairn, who never uses 10 words when one will do, doesn’t hold back. “Not to be missed, in the sense that you ought to try <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/28/make-your-own-fernet-branca-hangover-cure\" title=\"\">Fernet Branca</a> at least once,” he writes. “It is as near to expressing evil as a design can be.”</p> <p><em>Nairn’s London </em>used to be hard to track down; people loved it too much to chuck it out, for which reason old copies were difficult to come by.

success","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>George Bernard Shaw once remarked that reasonable people fit into the world, while unreasonable ones try changing it to fit them. All progress is therefore dependent on this brigade of stubborn nonconformists, the Irish playwright concluded.</p> <p>Many of us strive for such originality but worry that it is the domain of the blessedly talented, rather than individuals who have simply refused to embrace the status quo. In separate books tackling the subjects of originality and potential, two academics argue that all of us can innovate and excel with the right blueprint for bucking convention.</p> <p>Adam Grant’s <strong>Originals</strong> is the more immediately accessible of the two. A professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Grant debunks some commonly held assumptions about talent and success by reference to specific individuals and their stories. Celebrated businesspeople including Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are not typically predisposed to risk-taking, despite the popular view of the swashbuckling entrepreneur. Picasso did not generate consistently better ideas than his artistic rivals but just maximised his output, and with it the probability of striking gold every so often. Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech was a synthesis of last-minute scribbling and on-the-spot improvisation, not a meticulously prepared draft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6556744bbabe2d3d0a3be5a019604e87b802294b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6556744bbabe2d3d0a3be5a019604e87b802294b/128_143_2714_1628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Not predisposed to risk-taking’: Google founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kulish/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather like Malcolm Gladwell – whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/23/outliers-story-success-malcolm-gladwell\" title=\"\"><em>Outliers</em></a> has become a bible for those championing nurture over nature as a talent determinant – Grant believes ability is not innate but a product of experience. Younger siblings are likelier to make “originals” because being surrounded by authority figures conditions them to rebel. In professional baseball, this explains why the list of all-time greats for “stealing base”, one of the sport’s boldest tactics, includes few first-born children.</p> <p>By extension, Grant thinks we can foster originality in various walks of life by following some unconventional rules. Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s most successful hedge funds, encourages staff to be openly critical of their managers to spur innovation. Visualising failure, not success, has helped cold-water swimmer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/02/bay-of-whales-is-a-terrifying-place-to-swim-says-oceans-campaigner\" title=\"\">Lewis Pugh</a> to break endurance records by ensuring he is never complacent. Babble, an online magazine and blog about parenting, raised $3.3m in funding after founder Rufus Griscom began telling audiences why they should not back him at the start of his pitches. The unorthodox approach had the effect of immediately disarming investors’ natural scepticism, allowing them to see Griscom as an honest businessman rather than a slick sales type.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rose argues that our system of judging people according to their deviation from the mean is smothering our talents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At times, Grant could be accused of straying off-topic, especially when he is dispensing advice. Children taught how their bad behaviour affects others develop a moral sensibility lacking in those who are merely admonished, he writes, without providing a clear link to the concept of originality. For the most part, though, <em>Originals</em> succeeds by marrying sound research and insightful anecdotes to a breezy narrative style that belies Grant’s academic roots.</p> <p>While it is Grant who quotes Shaw, Todd Rose seems the more zealous disciple. In <strong>The End of Average</strong>, he argues that our system of judging people according to their deviation from the mean (faster, slower, stronger, weaker) is smothering our talents. The sweeping generalisations of averagarians, as he labels them, cannot but gloss over the multifaceted nature of an individual. The effect is pernicious in the extreme. Schools, for instance, rate pupils largely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/24/why-do-we-trust-exam-results\" title=\"\">on their ability to learn faster than the average</a>, and design curriculums to suit the speediest. Yet learning slowly does not preclude a student from ultimately mastering a subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/24/why-do-we-trust-exam-results\">Why do we trust exam results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rose wants the system to fit the individual, not vice versa, and thinks it can. The shining example is of Gilbert Daniels, whose research in the 1950s persuaded the US air force to make planes with adjustable cockpit controls that pilots of all shapes and sizes could fly more safely. More than 40 years later, a diminutive female pilot called Kim Campbell received the Distinguished Flying Cross for aerial heroics during the Iraq war. Yet before redesigning its planes, the air force would have rejected her for being too small.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Rose’s concepts are not always easy to grasp, and it is questionable whether his methods would entirely subvert our competitive urge to measure up. But they did guide his own journey from high-school dropout to Harvard professor. After flunking tests as an 18-year-old, Rose struggled to hold down a succession of minimum-wage jobs and was labeled a troublemaker by his seniors. The turnaround came, he writes, when he stopped trying to conform. By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/24/why-do-we-trust-exam-results\" title=\"\">developing a problem-solving method</a> that relied on his aptitude for visual thinking, rather than the classic working-memory system taught by his tutor, he was finally able to pass the graduate record examination. Rose is now the director of Harvard’s mind, brain and education programme, and his personal experiences are recounted hearteningly in his book. That alone makes it a worthwhile read for the aspiring nonconformist.</p> <p><em>Originals: How Non-Conformists Change the World by Adam Grant is published by Random House (£20). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/361190/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for £16</em></a></p> <p><em>The End of Average: How to Succeed in a World That Values Sameness by Todd Rose is published by Allen Lane (£20). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/336583/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for £16</em></a></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gen5","wordcount":"868","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/415e43bcef19c642bf2b79f33cae33270eac4c3e/0_0_824_494/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-06T06:45:00Z","standfirst":"Two US academics debunk common assumptions about potential and success"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/16/originals-adam-grant-end-of-average-todd-rose-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/16/originals-adam-grant-end-of-average-todd-rose-review","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"415e43bcef19c642bf2b79f33cae33270eac4c3e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/415e43bcef19c642bf2b79f33cae33270eac4c3e/0_0_824_494/500.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*4036176","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/415e43bcef19c642bf2b79f33cae33270eac4c3e","suppliersReference":"AR4","altText":"Lewis Pugh in the water at the north pole","caption":"‘Visualising failure, not success, has helped cold-water swimmer Lewis Pugh break endurance records by ensuring he is never complacent.’ Pugh became the first man to swim at the north pole in July 2007.

children’s book award in the UK, the Carnegie medal, organisers have announced. </p> <p>The CILIP Carnegie, which dates back to 1936 and has been won by names from Arthur Ransome to Noel Streatfeild, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/13/books.booksnews\">Pratchett’s first major book prize</a> when he won it in 2002. The author, who died last year after being diagnosed in 2007 with a rare form of Alzheimer’s, won the Carnegie in 2002 with his first novel for children, The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/30/the-shepherds-crown-review-terry-pratchett-discworld-posthumous\">The Shepherd’s Crown review – Terry Pratchett’s farewell to Discworld</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winning the prize 14 years ago, Pratchett gave a barnstorming acceptance speech in which he laid out the difference in the way he was viewed as a writer in the US and in the UK. “Over there, where I’ve only recently made much of an impression, the reviews tended to be quite serious and detailed, with – as Maurice himself would have put it, ‘long words, like corrugated iron’. Over here, while being very nice, they tended towards the ‘another wacky, zany book by comic author Terry Pratchett’. In fact, Maurice has no wack and very little zane. It’s quite a serious book. Only the scenery is funny,” <a href=\"http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/pressdesk/press.php?release=pres_terspeach.htm\">said Pratchett at the time</a>.</p> <p>“The problem is that we think the opposite of funny is serious. It is not. In fact, as GK Chesterton pointed out, the opposite of funny is not funny, and the opposite of serious is not serious. Benny Hill was funny and not serious; Rory Bremner is funny and serious; most politicians are serious but, unfortunately, not funny. Humour has its uses. Laughter can get through the keyhole while seriousness is still hammering on the door. New ideas can ride in on the back of a joke, old ideas can be given an added edge.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2016/jan/29/great-fiction-non-frances-hardinge-robert-mccrum-podcast\">What makes a book great? with Frances Hardinge and Robert McCrum – books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year, The Shepherd’s Crown, which continues the adventures of Pratchett’s teenage witch Tiffany Aching, is up against a host of former winners. The 20-strong longlist also features Frances Hardinge’s The Lie Tree, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/26/frances-hardinges-the-lie-tree-wins-costa-book-of-the-year-2015\">won the Costa book of the year</a>, as well as novels from previous Carnegie medallists Sally Gardner, Patrick Ness and David Almond.</p> <p>CILIP (the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals) also announced the longlist for the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration, with former children’s laureate Anthony Browne making the cut for Willy’s Stories, featuring his well-known chimpanzee. Current laureate Chris Riddell is nominated twice for the Kate Greenaway, for his own Goth Girl and the Fete Worse Than Death, and for Neil Gaiman’s The Sleeper and the Spindle. Oliver Jeffers is up for his picture book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/13/once-upon-an-alphabet-by-oliver-jeffers-picture-book\">Once Upon an Alphabet</a>, which he also wrote himself, and for his illustrations in The Day the Crayons Came Home, written by Drew Daywalt.</p> <p>The medals are judged by panels of expert librarians. This year’s chair, Sioned Jacques, called the longlists “outstanding”, adding that they “perfectly reflect the vibrancy of children’s books in the UK today”.</p> <p>“This is a real golden age of writing and illustrating for children and the range of skills and storytelling on display in the longlists is proof of the incredibly high standards of this ever-growing area of publishing – every book is a potential winner. These are all fantastic books and every one of them deserves a wide audience,” said Jacques.</p> <p>“The images and stories in both longlists leap off the page and the whole gamut of human life and experience is reflected, with books that cover family and friendship, love and loyalty and secrets and lies,” said CILIP president Dawn Finch. “There are books that explore war, slavery, civil rights and equality, others that re-imagine ancient myths, stories of coming-of-age and tales that span time and space, firing imaginations with every page that is read.”</p> <p>The shortlists will be announced on 15 March, and the winners will be announced on 20 June. Each medallist will receive £500 of books to donate to their local library, a gold medal, and £5,000 from the Colin Mears award.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gmqc","wordcount":"681","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/684775175d921c773811548a1b20ddddd49351ba/491_559_4888_2935/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside
