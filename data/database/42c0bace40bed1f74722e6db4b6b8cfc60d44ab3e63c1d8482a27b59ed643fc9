The sections on Daphne’s mental illness, informed as they are by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Janet Frame</a>’s own experiences in institutions, are especially powerful. Descriptions of events in Daphne’s life begin grounded in reality, but slip into grand, dreamlike imagery (“a woman led Daphne to the bathroom where a trough had been scooped from a side of one of the mountains”), vividly conveying her struggle for sanity. Lack of understanding of epilepsy at the time is touched on: Toby “falls into fits”, scaring and embarrassing his sisters. His illness severely restricts his life and only in dreams is he free to be and do what he wants. While a strong reflection of the time at which it was written, <em>Owls Do Cry</em> remains innovative and relevant. Frame’s idiosyncratic and startlingly visual style means that the book’s immense power to unnerve, astonish and impress endures.</p> <p>• To order <em>Owls Do Cry</em> for £7.19 (RRP £8.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360240/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

autobiography, Born to Run will be released internationally on 27 September – a few days after his 67th birthday.</p> <p>According to publishers Simon &amp; Schuster, Springsteen has been privately writing the autobiography for seven years, beginning work in 2009 after his performance with the E Street Band at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. </p> <p>Springsteen describes growing up in Freehold, New Jersey and according to the publisher recounts “his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band”.</p> <p>“Writing about yourself is a funny business,” Springsteen writes. “But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the publisher called it “the book we’ve been hoping for. Readers will see their own lives in Bruce Springsteen’s extraordinary story, just as we recognise ourselves in his songs.”</p> <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, which will publish Born to Run in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India also published Springsteen’s illustrated book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw_Pete\">Outlaw Pete</a> in 2014.</p> <p>“If you were to ask any publisher to name a cultural figure whose autobiography would provoke the greatest enthusiasm, Bruce Springsteen’s name would be on every list,” said Ian Chapman, CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster UK. “Beyond being one of the most admired individuals in the world, he is a captivating storyteller with a unique way of expressing himself.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

Authors and illustrators often do not speak, or interact. I never had a conversation with Vanessa, just a few tweets.”</p> <p>The Washington book was published on 5 January and set off a wave of criticism from reviewers, and on social media and Amazon, where 270 out of 371 reader reviews were one star as of Thursday morning. Scholastic initially defended A Birthday Cake, which centers on Washington’s head chef, the slave Hercules. But on 17 January it halted publication, explaining in a statement that the book “may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves”.</p> <p>Ganeshram says she was informed of the decision by her editor, Andrea Davis Pinkney.</p> <p>“And I said to her, ‘As you know, I have always had issues with these illustrations,’” Ganeshram said.</p> <p>Scholastic spokeswoman Kyle Good said the publisher would have no comment. Brantley-Newton, an award-winning illustrator and author, has not responded to phone and email requests for comment.</p> <p>While some authors and illustrators collaborate from the start, it’s also common for publishers to choose the creative team and have them work separately, especially when they don’t know each other. Ganeshram said she and Brantley-Newton have never met.</p> <p>The author had spent four years researching the life of Hercules for a larger project, but agreed to use some material for a picture story after speaking with Pinkney, who edited Ganeshram’s novel Stir it Up, published in 2011. Ganeshram had hoped A Birthday Cake would be the first in a series of works on Hercules.</p> <p>“For me, Hercules is everything,” she said, “so every opportunity to present him to the world was something to be seriously considered.”</p> <p>But Ganeshram said that she emailed Pinkney last spring, objecting to the “over-joviality” of some the illustrations and adding that a recent picture book, Emily Jenkins’ A Fine Dessert, had been rightly criticized for similar reasons.</p> <p>“And I said, ‘When can I start speaking to Vanessa? I would like to send some research material.’ And the editor told me, ‘Authors and illustrators don’t interact,’” Ganeshram said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/29/smiling-slaves-the-real-censorship-in-childrens-books\">The real censorship in children's books: smiling slaves is just the half of it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An award-winning journalist and author born to a Trinidadian father and Iranian mother, the 47-year-old Ganeshram noted that the book was considered offensive despite the diversity of those who worked on it. </p> <p>Brantley-Newton has described herself as coming from a “blended background – African-American, Asian, European, and Jewish” and has illustrated the children’s series Ruby and the Booker Boys, among other books. </p> <p>Pinkney is a highly respected editor and award-winning author who in 1998 founded the Hyperion imprint Jump at the Sun, which publishes African American children’s books.</p> <p>“A big aspect of the diversity movement is predicated on the idea of getting people who represent the background of those depicted in the story,” Ganeshram said. “We assume that the material will automatically be treated more delicately and more sensitively and we can see that it’s simply not true.”</p> <p>Some critics also faulted Ganeshram’s narrative, saying Washington’s determination to keep his slaves and Hercules’ eventual escape were confined to an author’s note. Ganeshram said the book only covers one day in Hercules’ life and that the author’s note was intended to “spark further discussion”.</p> <p>Ganeshram also said that she had not intended to write a story about slavery, but about a “great chef who made magic out of nothing” and against great odds, and about the love of his daughter. Asked if it was possible to include slaves in a narrative without having slavery becoming the point of the narrative, she said she wasn’t sure how to respond but that “we must be brave enough to continue to try”.</p> <p>“These people were individual human beings, with their own sensibility, with their own pride, with their own foibles. And to reduce them to only slaves is incredibly diminishing,” she said.</p> <p>“And the first thing we have to be brave enough to do is to reform the way we do these book, to reform the system, so we can explore this from every possible angle.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjc5","wordcount":"791","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f60ea7c16ff8b7b38f7f75e7303c111886480a7f/0_304_921_553/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-14T17:09:55Z","standfirst":"<p>Ramin Ganeshram says she objected to the illustrations months before book was published and subsequently pulled last month because of its depiction of slaves</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/george-washington-slave-cake-scholastic-book-author-objected-illustrations","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/george-washington-slave-cake-scholastic-book-author-objected-illustrations","sectionName":"US news","elements":[{"id":"f60ea7c16ff8b7b38f7f75e7303c111886480a7f","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f60ea7c16ff8b7b38f7f75e7303c111886480a7f/0_304_921_553/140.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/f60ea7c16ff8b7b38f7f75e7303c111886480a7f","suppliersReference":"NYET501","altText":"A Birthday Cake for George Washington","caption":"This book cover image released by Scholastic shows, A Birthday Cake for George Washington, by Ramin Ganeshram with illustrations by Vanessa Brantley-Newtown.

survey, with respondents suggesting they feared ebooks would negatively affect their children’s attention span or expose them to inappropriate content.</p> <p>More than 1,500 parents of UK children aged up to eight were surveyed by the reading charity BookTrust in association with the Open University. Asking parents about their children’s use of digital media and ebooks, the researchers found that most were worried about interactive ebooks, with only 8% having no concerns about their offspring’s use of the medium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/25/young-adult-readers-prefer-printed-ebooks\">Young adult readers 'prefer printed to ebooks'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concerns ranged from the fact that use of interactive ebooks would increase children’s screen time, a worry for 45% of parents, to the fear that children could lose interest in print books as a result, cited by 35%. More than a quarter of parents also believed that interactive ebooks would affect a child’s attention span, while 31% felt they could expose children to inappropriate content.</p> <p>“Parents thought that print books are ‘better’ for children’s eyes, that they give their children ‘less headaches’ and also are better for their children’s healthy sleep,” wrote the researchers. “They also pointed out that, unlike print books, digital books require greater care when handling. Some parents also voiced concerns about social risks associated with reading digital books, especially in terms of children’s addiction: ‘more addiction with interactive books’.”</p> <p>The researchers believe there is a need to “seriously address the concerns of parents around using digital books with their children” because “it’s clear that as children get older they will read more digital material”. They suggest that “those who have discovered the digital world with their parents may be more discerning readers and be less vulnerable to the allure of inappropriate or poor quality content”.</p> <p>According to the survey, The Digital Reading Habits of Children, print books remain the preferred reading format for children, with only 19% of children using an e-reader daily, and 57% never using one. Seventy-six per cent of parents cited print as a favoured format when reading for pleasure, compared to the 30% who cited interactive ebooks, and the 15% who cited simple ebooks. Print also came out top for educational reading, with 69% enjoying the format, compared to 34% for interactive ebooks and 15% for simple ebooks.</p> <p>Parents whose children preferred print said the reasons for this ranged from their child liking to turn pages (52%), to their child enjoying owning a print book (43%) or choosing one from a library (41%).</p> <p>BookTrust chief executive Diana Gerald said that “children will read online sooner or later”, and that it is “far better they are guided in their use through the eyes of a common-sense parent or carer than they are left to explore alone”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/10/ebooks-are-changing-the-way-we-read-and-the-way-novelists-write\">Ebooks are changing the way we read, and the way novelists write</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“BookTrust is an unrivalled fan of printed books, but we must all embrace the digital world, as children are growing up using many different platforms for their reading. What’s fantastic is that even reluctant readers are probably reading more now than ever if you take account of ebooks, social media, gaming narrative, Facebook, texting, Twitter and online forums,” said Gerald.</p> <p>“However, some parents think digital reading has no place in shared family life. They think they might contaminate children’s’ reading experiences if they endorse digital books, but this need not be the case. When used thoughtfully, in partnership with printed books, digital books can enhance and encourage children’s reading for pleasure and can encourage further reading with print books.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjvc","wordcount":"589","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/832e68fcee155768aad6ad2d27343261fc120fd1/0_85_5168_3103/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Research

My years in theatre came with 10am starts; I could comfortably press snooze until 8.40am, then speed through my morning routine before dashing out of the house at 9.10am. The thing is, I have always considered myself to be a night owl, and I was rarely in bed before the early hours of the morning. A novel, a batch of something in the oven, a recipe to write up – something would always keep my attention from sleep. </p> <p> And then, last week, my schedule changed dramatically. I’ve taken on a new job that requires me to rise at 6.30am. I’m not getting up to make pastry (yet – details about a cafe and new events will be coming later this year) but am instead spending some time as an au pair while I write my first book. I’m up bright and early each morning, flipping pancakes or toasting bagels for two little ones, readying them for another day at school. Once they’re there, I retreat to my desk, writing into the late afternoon before I put a chicken, or some lamb chops, in the oven for their dinner. It’s a life I am thoroughly enjoying. </p> <p> To my immense surprise, the early mornings are a complete joy. I’m reading more, taking time before I sit behind my desk to enjoy a couple of chapters and a cup of tea. I am also spending time on my favourite meal of the day, rather than walking out the door with a banana or slice of toast in hand. As breakfasts go, kedgeree offers up pretty much everything I’m looking for: carbs, fish, herbs, spices, an egg. A perfect marriage of British and Indian flavours, its first appearance is debated, but it is generally agreed that its origins lie in the Indian <em>khichri</em>, a dish dating back to the 14th century. With the addition of the smoked fish and boiled egg, it’s become a common breakfast table feature here in Britain.</p> <p> I first read The Camomile Lawn at 13 or 14, sneaking it off my mum’s bookshelf and finding myself both thrilled and shocked by the multitude of affairs (and relationships between cousins) it contained. Re-reading it as an adult, I’m most taken with the tangible loss of innocence, the shift between the final idyllic summer on the camomile lawn – all Terror Runs and kedgerees – and the years of war that were to follow. Apparently inspired by Wesley’s own experiences in London during the Blitz, the juxtaposing freedom from convention and the ever-present terror of war are at constant odds throughout the novel. It exposes what’s truly important to the characters – the things they value and are unwilling to sacrifice. The kedgeree, from the last days on the camomile lawn, seemed a fitting dish to recreate here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe1f94c4064ac699d75b4c1127e66228a42192a5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fe1f94c4064ac699d75b4c1127e66228a42192a5/0_0_2166_2166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kedgeree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A perfect marriage of British and Indian flavours, its first appearance is debated, but it is generally agreed that its origins lie in the Indian <em>khichri</em>, a dish dating back to the 14th century.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kedgeree: the recipe</strong></h2> <p><strong> Serves 5</strong></p> <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br /> 500ml water <br /> 1 onion – roughly chopped <br /> 1 small carrot - roughly chopped<br /> 1 stalk celery - roughly chopped <br /> 1 bay left <br /> 5 black peppercorns <br /> 300g smoked haddock (undyed) <br /> 2tbsp butter <br /> 3 small brown onions 2<br /> cloves garlic<br /> 1tsp turmeric<br /> 1tsp ground cumin <br /> 1tsp ground coriander <br /> 1tsp fennel seeds <br /> 3 crushed cardamom pods<br /> 180ml double cream <br /> 250g basmati rice <br /> Parsley <br /> 5 eggs <br /> Mango chutney</p> <p> <strong>Equipment<br /> </strong> Knife and chopping board <br /> Wide bottomed saucepan<br /> Large saucepan <br /> Wooden spoon <br /> Medium saucepan <br /> Fork</p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Put the chopped vegetables, peppercorns and the bay leaf in the wide-bottomed pan with the haddock. Cover with the water and bring to the boil on the stove. As soon as it comes to the boil, turn the heat off and set it aside it to cool - the fish will finish cooking as it does so. </p> <p><strong> 2 </strong>Pour the rice into the medium saucepan. Rinse and drain the rice three times in cold water. Add fresh water to the pan until it sits one knuckle higher than the top of the rice. Cover, bring it to the boil, then turn down to a low simmer and cook until the water is at the level of the rice. This should take around 8-10 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave the lid on tightly, covering the pan with a tea towel if it isn’t a snug fit. Leave to steam in the pan for fifteen minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.</p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Chop the onions into fine slices and mince the garlic. Heat the butter until foaming in the frying pan and add the onions and garlic. Fry until soft and translucent. Add the spices and fry for another two minutes. Add 300ml of the fish cooking water and reduce the liquid by half. Finally, add the cream and reduce until thick. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Meanwhile, put the eggs in cold water and boil them to your taste - for this recipe, I like them cooked for five minutes after the water comes to the boil. Run them under cold water and peel them. </p> <p><strong>5 </strong>Tip the rice into the sauce and stir through so that each grain is coated. Flake the fish in and stir this through too. Serve immediately with mango chutney, parsley and a peeled, sliced egg on each plate.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjx6","wordcount":"909","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/18442402725396ad0b0b3ca5a757b98db772c821/0_221_1665_999/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-18T17:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As

When his family comes into some money and moves to an affluent town, he feels out of place in his new school and environment. Sam now lives close to the imposing Bierce Priory. Its owners, the wealthy and influential Greenhills, are the town’s resident philanthropists and a case study in success. Slowly, Sam uncovers the terrifying truth about the Greenhills and the town they live in; a truth so disturbing that Sam’s life becomes a living, freakish nightmare, in which he is forced to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Imagine every nightmare you’ve ever had about doctors and surgeries, every terrifying dream you’ve ever had about being tortured and then maybe you’ll be prepared for this book. Cheshire has a talent for writing the terrifying and the gruesome, whilst making it so addictive that it’s impossible to stop reading, even if you can’t sleep for a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ed83bb73db96afe678fc789e07a97911af1a5e62\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ed83bb73db96afe678fc789e07a97911af1a5e62/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"Flesh and Blood by Simon Cheshire\" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plot is amazing and felt like a classic horror story yet refreshing; however, the themes are just unnerving. It’s safe to say that the last pages will be stuck in your head for days. </p> <p>The story is definitely grim and you shouldn’t read it unless you have a strong stomach, and no lunch. </p> <p>At some points in the book you get spine-tingling chills that set you on edge. No book can scare you to death and grip you like this one; clear your schedule because you will not be able to put it down. </p> <p>I would recommend this book to people who like a bit of gore and good old-fashioned scaring, though only if you can handle its creepy contents. But I’ll warn you now, you will not want to go to the doctors for at least a year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Or is it the entire visceral experience, tragedy and all?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c65974177347ea2418703416d5b9302765a66a32\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c65974177347ea2418703416d5b9302765a66a32/0_189_867_520/500.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Doyle: 'doomed love is compelling'.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Doyle: ‘doomed love is compelling’.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Here follows a list of my favourite doomed romances in YA [MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS]:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/video/2013/dec/13/veronica-roth-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3yv84\"                        data-video-id=\"2007886\"            data-video-name=\"Veronica Roth interview - video\"            data-video-provider=\"HarperCollins\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/4/1386160115482/Veronica-Roth-interview-016.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-424115199\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2013/12/04/131204Roth_8405037.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/04/131204Roth-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/12/04/131204Roth/131204Roth.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/06/131204Roth_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/04/131204Roth_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/04/131204Roth.webm\"/> </video> </figure>   <h2><strong>1. Tris and Tobias in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/divergent-6.html\">Divergent</a> by Veronica Roth</strong></h2> <p>There’s nothing quite so frightening as investing in a series with first-person point-of-view narration, only to have it abruptly switch to a different narrator right at the end of the final novel. That’s when you know something bad’s about to happen. The beginning of Tris and Tobias’ love story was the stuff YA dreams are made of. Both a little damaged, but loyal and brave, their union was inevitable. Their separation? Perhaps, this was too. After a long and arduous fight for justice in her world, Tris ends up sacrificing herself for what she believes to be the right reason: to save everyone she loves. The final novel ends two years after Tris’ death when Tobias is still mourning her. “A fire that burns that bright is not meant to last,” he says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jul/29/the-10-best-hunger-games-quotes-that-show-katnisss-strength\">The 10 best  Hunger Games quotes that show Katniss's strength</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2. Katniss and Gale in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/hunger-games-11.html\">The Hunger Games</a> by Suzanne Collins</strong></h2> <p>This is a controversial choice, but you can’t root for Katniss and Peeta without also understanding the dissolution of the love (and more importantly, all the potential) she had with her best friend Gale, aka Hot Hemsworth. Perhaps Katniss and Gale would have ended up together had she not been reaped, had she not had to kill a bunch of other people and dismantle her entire problematic society from within. People change, especially teenagers. They drift apart, and the woman that Katniss became was no longer suited to the man that Gale grew into. In the end, Peeta is more than a worthy choice – kind and loyal, and true, but a part of me will always mourn Revolutionary Gale, just a little, every now and then. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/01/top-10-teen-books-to-save-your-life-jennifer-niven\">Jennifer Niven's top 10 teen books to save your life</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>3. Violet Markey and Theodore Finch in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/all-the-bright-places.html\">All the Bright Places</a> by Jennifer Niven</strong></h2> <p>By page three, you know this book is going to punch you in the heart. Don’t fight it. Just lay back and let it happen. Violet and Finch first meet on top of the Bell Tower at school, a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of how precarious their relationship turns out to be. Violet is still mourning the death of her sister, and Finch is suffering from severe bipolar depression. In each other, they find solace. Niven writes love in a way that reaches out of the pages and pulls you in. Unfortunately, you’re still there when heartbreak hits. It inches towards you, slowly, slowly, until you’ve cried yourself into severe dehydration without even realising it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/13/the-greatest-john-green-quotes-ever\">The greatest John Green quotes ever</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4. Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fault-in-our-stars-4.html\">The Fault in Our Stars</a> by John Green</strong></h2> <p>If you want to feel every emotion on the human spectrum all within the space of a few hours, then I urge you to read this book. John Green will play your heartstrings like a guitar and fill your head with a book of quotes about love, life and loss. Augustus meets Hazel in a cancer support group, and what follows is a short-lived romance bursting with all-consuming love. This is modern tragedy at its best: gut-wrenching, soul-destroying perfection. Here is a love that lasts only fleetingly in the lives of these young protagonists but is potent enough to make it feel like infinity. In the words of Augustus Waters: “Oh, I wouldn’t mind Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to my heart broken by you.” And it’s our privilege to watch.</p> <h2><strong>5. Twylla and Lief in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/sin-eater-s-daughter.html\">The Sin Eater’s Daughter</a> by Melinda Salisbury</strong></h2> <p>I have it on very good authority that Melinda Salisbury likes to make her readers suffer. She is, after all, a Slytherin. Oh, how I suffered for this ill-fated love. Twylla is Daunen-embodied, the daughter of the gods, a girl who can kill anyone with a single touch. She spends her days holed up in the castle at Lormere, sheltered from the outside world and bound to a life she does not want. Enter a charming and compelling new guard, Lief: a regular medieval stud with a wide smile and an enticing sense of mischievousness. All of a sudden, Twylla’s life is ignited by love, by excitement, by possibility, and as the reader, you are willing it to go well. You are dying for her to capture some small kernel of joy for herself. But alas, no, it is not to be. Betrayal hurtles towards her like a battering ram, and the axe of doom descends on this once wonderful love in a thrilling climax. And just like Twylla, you are left reeling. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/10/the-next-together-lauren-james-review\">The Next Together by Lauren James – review</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>6. Matthew and Katherine in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/330494/\">The Next Together</a> by Lauren James</strong></h2> <p>This is a reincarnation romance novel about a couple who are destined to meet again and again in different lives only to be torn apart each time. It’s epic love and doomed romance all rolled into one. The protagonists are different in every era, but one thing remains constant: their perfectness for one another. But fate is not on their side… or is it? This book will wear your fingernails down as you flip through the pages desperately hoping that that the Crimean-war-era Matthew and Katherine (Mattherine, as I call them) or the Carlisle versions, or the near-future scientists ones, or… well, you get the idea, will be the ones that make it work against the odds. Like Matthew and Katherine, your heart will break over and over again, until the reason for their repeated ill-fated couplings is finally revealed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/07/maggie-stiefvater-interview-shiver-trilogy-sinner\">Maggie Stiefvater: I steal a real human heart for each of my characters</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>7. Blue and Gansey in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/394009/\">The Raven Cycle</a> by Maggie Stievfater</strong></h2> <p>This is perhaps the most unnerving tragedy in YA, because although the final book has yet to be released, we all know the romance between the protagonists, Blue and Gansey, is doomed. How do we know that? Because Maggie Stievfater told us, right at the beginning of book one. One of the first things the reader learns is that Blue and Gansey are going to kiss, and that Gansey is going to die afterwards. There follows two more powerhouse books complete with thrilling twists and turns, impressive emotional depth and several almost-kisses. As a reader, you are conflicted. You want the kiss – the moment of completion for these characters who are so clearly in love, but you definitely don’t want the death that will follow directly after. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/aug/30/snape-favourite-harry-potter-character\">Snape is voted favourite Harry Potter character</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>8. Snape and Lily in JK Rowling’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-16.html\">Harry Potter series</a></strong></h2> <p>An unconventional choice, perhaps, but you cannot deny that this is a tragedy, and the most compelling of doomed romances, probably because the romance didn’t actually happen, yet the associated unrequited feelings steered a large chunk of the storyline to its conclusion. It’s easy to break down, really. Snape loved Lily, Lily loved James, Lily and James had Harry, Snape mercilessly bullied Harry because Harry reminded him of James, and in a move worthy of the ultimate redemption, Snape sacrificed himself to save Harry and, actually, the world. All because he so loved the boy’s mother, even after all these years. Always. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/01/interview-leigh-bardugo-sarah-j-maas-grisha-throne-of-glass\">Fangirling: teen megafan interviews Leigh Bardugo and Sarah J Maas</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>9. Celaena and Chaol from the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/throne-of-glass.html\">Throne of Glass series</a> by Sarah J Maas</strong></h2> <p>For the first three books, it was all going so well. Calaena meets Chaol when he is Captain of the Guard at the palace and she is the King’s assassin. Sparks fly, flirtation ensues, and the romance explodes from the pages and sweeps the reader right up inside it. Then for complicated, highly exciting plot reasons, Calaena has to travel to another land, where her true soulmate, Rowan, happens to be waiting for her. And Chaol? The swoon-worthy, fantasy-inducing, leading man from the initial books fades into the shadows and drifts towards the scrap-heap of YA love where other fan favourites, like Gale aka Hot Hemsworth and shirtless Jacob Black are there to welcome him. </p> <h2><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/romeo-and-juliet-64.html\">Romeo and Juliet</a> By William Shakespear</strong><strong>e</strong></h2> <p>Five hundred years ago, William Shakespeare gifted the world with the poster boy and girl for doomed romance, and after all this time, they stand unchallenged at the forefront of tragedy. It’s a tale we all know well. Boy and girl meet, boy and girl fall madly in love, boy and girl are torn apart by their feuding families, boy and girl kill themselves in a horrible, tragic theme that continues to pervade modern literature. It’s a masterpiece. A heartbreaking masterpiece. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0dde710f1710beec9c08abc3d54a5ceb9f92b33d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0dde710f1710beec9c08abc3d54a5ceb9f92b33d/0_0_1594_2409/662.jpg\" alt=\"Inferno\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Catherine Doyle is the author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360880/\">Inferno</a> (Blood for Blood Series: Book 2), published by Chicken House. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360880/\">Buy Inferno at the Guardian bookshop</a>.

The only place metaphysics has ever sent anyone is round the bend or off with the fairies. So you’d have to be somewhat eccentric to believe there might be any practical upshot of Immanuel Kant’s transcendental idealism, and more than a little unhinged to think those uses might include manipulating the fabric of reality to travel across time, teleport across space or rip out tendons by pure thought.</p> <p>That is presumably why novelist <a href=\"http://www.adamroberts.com/\">Adam Roberts</a> gave the idea to Roy Curtius, a character teetering on the edge of psychopathy, prepared to sacrifice the odd mere mortal’s life in his obsessive pursuit of ultimate truth. Lethal without having any ill-intent, he is perhaps the most dangerous nerd in fiction, a warning never to trust anyone who says his only friends are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/philosophy\">philosophy</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/apr/25/1\">Fermi Paradox</a>.</p> <p>Roy is the menacing nemesis of the main narrator of <em>The Thing Itself</em>, Charles Gardner, almost killing him in incidents decades and literally poles apart. But is Roy a lunatic or a genius? When Charles is courted by the mysterious Institute, which claims to have verified Roy’s central idea, it seems he might be both. Once Charles is roped in, his life becomes a bruising, perilous adventure in which it is never clear who is to be trusted, who is bonkers and what is real.</p> <p>If that were all there was to the book it would be a kind of infinitely superior <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/danbrown\">Dan Brown</a> romp, elevated by its genuinely intelligent philosophical core. Indeed, Roberts is not embarrassed to use the odd genre trope when needed, such as when he gets Charles to ask someone to run through Kant’s categories one more time, obviously so we can hear them.</p> <p>But this main narrative alternates with other chapters involving different characters and stories, each written in a completely different style, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce\">Joyce</a>an stream of conscious, 17th-century vernacular, and a pastiche of Thomas de Quincey. We get some inkling of their connection to the main thread, but it is not until the end that we see how it all fits, and even then perhaps not completely.</p> <p>This is really walking the literary high wire, and Roberts not only keeps his balance, he makes the spectacle compelling. I can’t think of another such ostentatiously clever novel that is so dramatically successful, as rigorous psychologically as it is logically. Like Kant’s thing in itself, Roberts’s eponymous novel does not fit into any standard categories.</p> <p>Roberts is a fine writer who has the ability to make acute observations and find just the right words to describe them. You’ll know what’s being described by “That high violin whine, and the burn-y stench of chewed-up tooth, and the shards of discomfort than penetrate the protective sheath of anaesthesia” without me having to tell you. And you’ll certainly recognise the barmaid who displays “the sort of professional disinterest that makes British pubs such havens”.</p> <p>There are plenty of deft comic touches to lighten the philosophical weight, such as when the secretive, powerful Institute sets Charles up with a car and a stash of cash. But before it gets too <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">Bond</a>, we are brought bathetically down to earth as he is instructed “you’ll need to keep receipts for purchases over five pounds”.</p> <p>This is too peculiar a brew to be to everyone’s taste. It’s often heavy going, which I mean as a compliment. When you’re dealing with the ineffable then you’re bound to wonder sometimes what the ‘effin hell is going on. Like a work of philosophy, <em>The Thing Itself</em> can’t be read too breezily because you have to attend very carefully to the ideas and arguments, and how they relate to each other. If you passively allow yourself to de dazzled by Roberts’s intelligence and invention, you won’t see what that brilliance is illuminating.</p> <p>Roberts offers a mystical reading of Kant that has some parallels with recurrent ideas in Indian philosophy. We live trapped in the world of appearances, unable to touch the thing in itself. But we perhaps can get some tantalising sense of the ultimate Oneness of reality, of which we and everything else is a part. Furthermore, this Ultimate is not inert and so therefore merits the kind of awe, if not worship, that we have given to gods. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that for all its ingenuity, “A/K” – Applied Kant – almost certainly won’t work. What Roberts shows us is that while metaphysics may leave the world as it is, it might change us.</p> <p>• Julian Baggini’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/275776/s/freedom-regained/\"><em>Freedom Regained: The Possibility of Free Will</em></a> is published by Granta.

With the increased media coverage of gender dysphoria amongst children and young people, it’s important to demystify some of the terminology. <br /></p> <h2>What is gender identity?</h2> <p>It is a sense of your self as being male, female, transgendered, or somewhere along the male/female spectrum (non-binary). Gender identities are diversifying and different self-identifiers are emerging such as “non-binary” and “<a href=\"http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderqueer\">gender queer</a>”. <br /> <br />The majority of young people have a gender identity which matches the sex into which they were born (biological or natal sex) and would identify as “cisgender”. For a small number of children and young people, however, their gender identity and biological/natal sex does not match and this may result in discomfort and distress with the body. This is called gender dysphoria. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/28/top-10-books-about-gender-identity\">Top 10 books about gender identity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In some cases the young people may identify as transgendered. In other cases these experiences are transient, fluid and part of development, but occasionally, if the gender dysphoria persists, the young person may wish to seek further support. <br /></p> <h2>Gender dysphoria in children. What does this mean?</h2> <p>Children from a very young age or early childhood may identify very strongly as the opposite to their birth or assigned sex. This may be expressed through verbal statements about how they identify and through preferences in clothes, play and peer relationships. In some cases, these feelings may be transient and their intensity may reduce when the child approaches puberty. In other cases these feelings intensify and continue into adolescence and adulthood. It’s important that through this sometimes complicated journey the young person feels supported. <br /></p> <h2>Gender dysphoria in adolescents</h2> <p>For some young people the gender dysphoria may emerge around the time of puberty; for other young people feelings of gender dysphoria, already experienced from a young age, can become more intense and distressing as puberty commences. </p> <h2>What can be done to help a child or young person who is exploring their gender identity?</h2> <p><strong>Professional help </strong></p> <p>If a child or adolescent is very distressed or troubled about their gender identity there is help available. In the first instance GPs would be able to support and refer to a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) or to the highly specialist Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust who will work with the whole family. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/15/transgender-identity-changers-coopers-gender-fluidity\">Transgender: identity is never one single thing so tick the box that says 'other'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s vital that young people feel supported and are seen as individuals when they seek help. Although young people have in common the experience of gender dysphoria their future trajectories or pathways can vary widely. Children and adolescents who experience gender dysphoria are a particular group, distinct from adults presenting with gender dysphoria, so they need to be supported accordingly. </p> <h2>Support for young people and families </h2> <p><strong>Talking therapies</strong></p> <p>A number of different talking therapies are available. The aim of talking therapy is definitely not for the professional to try to change the mind of the young person, but to facilitate exploration of gender identities and to give information about gender dysphoria and all the options open to young people. </p> <p>We know that family support is very important. Often families are seen together with their young person, and this can be helpful for the family to feel wholly supported in the exploration of the gender identity of the young person. However young people can be seen on their own so that they have a private space to explore their feelings; often adolescents are likely to value the opportunity to talk in private. </p> <p><strong>Group support </strong></p> <p>Group support is a good way for young people to meet and discuss their situation with others who may be in a similar position. Groups can reduce feelings of isolation and stigma that young people and their families often experience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/live/2016/jan/28/webchat-transgender-teen-ya-fiction\">Live webchat: transgender rights and teen fiction - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Support with education </strong><br /> <br />Young people with gender dysphoria can be supported in a variety of ways, and with the right guidance and understanding, support can be offered in their school or college, by professionals and by LGBT support groups. Our service works with a range of schools to help them provide the best support possible to children and young people with gender dysphoria and we often provide advice to schools regarding how to support a young person in difficult situations, such as which toilets and changing rooms to use. <br /> <br /><strong>Support groups </strong><br /> <br />There are a growing number of support groups in the UK which offer support for gender variant children and their families. Support and guidance can vary depending on the support group, but may include offering social activities, so young people are less isolated and can meet people who identify in a similar way or are questioning their gender in a safe space. They may also provide talking groups for young people, adolescents, siblings and parents to support different family members. <br /> <br /><strong>Physical treatments </strong><br /> <br />In some cases, following an assessment at a Specialist Gender Service, a young person may be prescribed the hormone blocker. Hormone blockers can be prescribed to prevent any further pubertal development by temporarily “pausing puberty”, and also, importantly, allow a breathing space for the young person to continue to explore their gender identity without the worry that their body is still developing. The hormone blocker is an injection, usually given monthly. Its effects are reversible so if it is discontinued the pre-programmed hormones turn on again. <br /> <br />In biological/natal females the hormone blocker will stop menstruation and further breast development and in natal males, if given in the early stages of puberty will prevent the voice breaking and masculinization. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/01/top-10-books-transgender-authors-trans-characters\">Top 10 books by transgender authors featuring trans characters</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <br />It is usually not possible to predict how someone will feel about their gender identity when they are on the hormone blocker. It is important to stress to young people and families that there is no right or wrong outcome or pathway and it is vital for the young person to feel supported without judgement around how they are feeling. <br /> <br />Some young people may feel more comfortable with their body they were born with while on the blocker and may opt to come off it after a certain period of time. Others may feel their gender dysphoria stays the same or increases while on the blocker and they may then consider less reversible physical treatments such as cross sex hormones from the age of 16 years. <br /></p> <h2>Some definitions </h2> <p><strong>Gender-variant:</strong> an adjective to describe individuals whose gender identity, role, or expression differs from what is normative for their assigned sex in a given culture and historical period. </p> <ul> <li>Children can be gender variant from a very young age or early childhood. </li> <li>Sense of self may not match their biological attributes. </li> <li>May exhibit cross gender behaviour and wish to be recognised as other gender. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Transgender:</strong> an adjective to describe a diverse group of individuals who cross or transcend culturally defined categories of gender. The gender identity of transgender people differs to varying degrees from the sex they were assigned at birth. <br /> <br /><strong>Transition:</strong> the period of time when individuals change from the gender role associated with their sex assigned at birth to a different gender role. For many people, this involves learning how to live socially in another gender role; for others this means finding a gender role and expression that is most comfortable for them. <br /> <br />Transition may or may not include feminisation or masculinisation of the body through hormones or other medical procedures. The nature and duration of transition is variable and individualised. <br /> <br /><strong><a href=\"http://tavistockandportman.uk/\">The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust</a></strong>: a specialist mental health Trust with a focus on training and education alongside a full range of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and psychological therapies.

Little, Brown, publisher of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, said it was “too early to say” whether there would be midnight openings this time round, but that Rowling herself would not be doing any events.</p> <p>As the book topped the <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/books/bestsellers\">Waterstones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Sellers-Books/zgbs/books\">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/best-sellers-books-Amazon/zgbs/books\">Amazon.com</a> bestseller lists – where it is already discounted to half price – Daunt said there were “no sweeter three words to the ears of a bookseller than ‘the eighth story’.</p> <p>“Younger booksellers now face, of course, the dubious prospect of their older colleagues rolling out war stories of Harry Potter launches for the next five months. On 31 July, we will put these into the shade.”</p> <p>Simon Heafield of Foyles said the bookshop chain was “massively excited at the news and are already putting our heads together on the question of how to mark the occasion in style.” “It’s great that bookshops will get the chance to benefit from this new chapter of Harry’s story,” he said.</p> <p>David Shelley, chief executive of Little, Brown, said on Wednesday that Rowling and her team had received many requests from fans who cannot see the play to publish it in book form: “We are absolutely delighted to be able to make it available for them,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script\">New Harry Potter book from JK Rowling coming out in July: the play script</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The upcoming book, which will reproduce the script from the forthcoming play by JK Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, shifts the action of the Harry Potter stories to 19 years after the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Both activities get its heroine, the beautiful, discontented Emma Bovary, into trouble. Married to a dull doctor, and mouldering away in the country where nothing ever happens, Emma – her head full of romantic novels – turns daily life into fantasy and pays the price. Even her death is botched. The joke is on her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"41fab3bddaec7312e054feec8fec828bb1a407ff\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/41fab3bddaec7312e054feec8fec828bb1a407ff/0_127_1800_2440/738.jpg\" alt=\"The Massive Tragedy of Madame Bovary! at Liverpool Everyman Theatre, by Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse and Peepolykus Image shows: Javier Marzan and John Nicholson PR image sent from: D.Beaumont@everymanplayhouse.com\" width=\"738\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> In an evening billed as “Gustave Flaubert’s complex novel lovingly derailed”, <a href=\"http://www.peepolykus.com/home\">Peepolykus</a> replace the author’s sly, dry comic observations with full-on slapstick. Towards the end, a man in a dinosaur costume pops by. There is the addition of a metatheatrical device in which the actors, who play both themselves and the characters, comment on the action. At one point Emma Fielding (who also plays Emma Bovary) suggests the heroine is suffering from depression and we need to see that, to which co-adapter Javier Marzan replies: “Emma, I’m not a dramaturg but I think dramatising six weeks of silence is going to be a bit boring.” So too is always looking for the next gag.</p> <p> There is a good, tight, two-hour show struggling to get out of this over-extended evening in which no double entendre or idea from R&amp;D has been discarded – including the ponderous framing device featuring two rat-catchers. It’s a pity, because this is sometimes very funny, perceptive and true to the novel, while Fielding is highly watchable and makes us like Emma more than Flaubert does.</p> <p> There are some terrific moments, including the La Vaubyessard ball, where we see Emma reeling with emotion, trapped within a structure that neatly represents chandelier, crinoline and prison. This is a show delivered with both love and lunacy, but with more discipline it would point up how tragedy and farce are close cousins. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/the-massive-tragedy-of-madame-bovary\">Liverpool Everyman</a> until 27 February.

This history, intersecting with the present in alternating segments, concerns 13-year-old Eliza, who lived in the house with her younger siblings more than 100 years ago.</p> <p>Through skilful clues we learn that Mary’s young children died in horrific circumstances. These are mirrored to an extent in the past narrative, which also deals with the abuse and murder of children. Myerson’s writing is keenly observant: a bee crawls over a bloom, “falling backwards into the air… lifting off and away”; a freshly skinned rabbit has a “bright raw smell”, Eliza feels a “wild, smashed” sensation on catching sight of the sea. Her evocation of the earlier era is excellent: a neighbour’s children shake the tablecloth outside, even though they have not eaten, to keep up appearances; a character is “all lamb and lettuce”.</p> <p>She also depicts mental states brilliantly: when Mary asks Graham if he ever gets lonely, he looks at her “with a relaxed kind of interest, as if she were asking him to think of his favourite colour or a number between one and seven”. “Love,” Myerson writes, in reference to a relationship that has endured more than most, is just “the smallest sliver of a so much larger, more complicated thing”. Mary’s grief is captured when she is “struck by how pointless it felt to push a metal hook with an ornament hanging off it through a hole in her ear”, or when someone mentions a 10‑year old boy and she thinks: “His mother has managed to keep him safe for a whole decade.”</p> <p>It is not clear, however, what the past narrative adds, besides being an alternate plot device. Both narratives concern crimes against children committed by a man and are narrated by females. Mary experiences some resolution; Eliza does not. Characters are bewildering. James Dix, the villain of the past narrative, who appears as if by magic beneath a tree felled in a storm, tells Eliza: “You’re mine … It’s you I came for”; then, when he gets her, that her love has “poisoned” him and driven him to the crime he commits which doesn’t itself make sense.</p> <p>Eliza’s father goes from being hardly present – James’s abuse of Eliza, her mother, her siblings and the family dog takes place under his nose – to leading a posse out for revenge. Eliza moves from detesting James to urinating in ecstasy during their sexual encounters. She protests only feebly when he murders a neighbour in her presence, bickers, then laughs with him about it. The implausibility of the characters is reflected at the level of plot, with every gory eventuality visible a mile off – though perhaps this is unavoidable in a novel in which supernatural intimations are the norm.</p> <p>As for Mary, she embarks on an affair then can’t bear to leave the wronged wife uncomforted days later when the husband elopes with a 15-year-old. At the conclusion, she discovers the house that has traumatised her for months “feels like home”; “this place. I love it” she pronounces. Not long ago she saw a butchered girl behind the apple store. I have no idea what has heralded this change of heart or what Myerson is driving at here; the ending feels like an abrupt, convenient and grossly inadequate conclusion to a narrative of horrific loss and mental fragmentation.</p> <p>• Grace McCleen’s <em>The Offering</em> is published by Sceptre.

January 2014, Henning Mankell was diagnosed with lung cancer. This came as a surprise: a non-smoker for many years, Mankell had recently been in a car accident and attributed the pain he was suffering to the aftereffects of the crash – but, as he notes, in the opening pages of <em>Quicksand</em>, “The diagnosis was very clear: it was serious, possibly incurable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/henning-mankell-farewell-cancer-dying-unpublished-pieces\">Henning Mankell’s final farewell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That word “serious” is key to a reading of the 67 short essays or reflections that follow. The book opens with a double dedication, to Mankell’s wife, Eva, and to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/13/pompeii-hit-summer-destination-for-british\" title=\"\">baker of Pompeii, Terentius Neo and his wife</a>, who were killed during the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79. An attractive couple in the prime of life, Mankell notes that they “seem to be two people who take their lives extremely seriously”. Elsewhere, he recalls the moment when, aged nine, he first understood that “I am myself and nobody else. I cannot be exchanged for anybody else. Life has suddenly become a serious matter.” Clearly, for Mankell, to treat life as a serious matter is a key element of what it means to be a human being. Serious people take responsibility, not only for their own actions, but also for their environment and for other creatures, whether living or as yet unborn. This is especially important for those of us who are lucky enough to live in places where every day is not a fight simply to exist: “People living on the outermost edge of society have no choice,” Mankell says. “Having the possibility to make decisions about what to do with one’s life is a great privilege. As far as most people on this planet are concerned, life is simply about survival.” One powerful example of how we fail to act as serious human beings, and a recurring motif throughout the book, is the question of how we deal with nuclear waste.</p> <p>In 2012, Mankell had come across a newspaper article about some mountain tunnels that were being dug at a place called Onkalo, in Finland, to store radioactive waste safely “at the very least for 100,000 years”. This article, Mankell notes, was tucked away on an inside page, and afforded less space than pieces about “the love life of a rock star, how to avoid paying tax without breaking the law or how to lose X kilos within a fortnight”. Now, as he waits for the results of his cancer treatment, Mankell makes the issue of nuclear waste storage a personal project, writing to the directors of the Onkalo facility to request a visit (ironically, they reject him because they cannot guarantee his safety in the underground caves and tunnels), then contacting a similar project in Sweden, which he is allowed to visit, and where he is treated very graciously (though this does little to reassure him).</p> <p>It is not surprising that so much of <em>Quicksand</em> is about time: time running out; vast, unimaginable aeons of time past and future; single moments when, by chance, a whole life can take a new direction. Mankell explores time in its many aspects with a blend of near-childlike wonder and unflinching reason. Many of his thoughts are reflected through his first encounters with the world, whether it be the death of a girl who has fallen through lake ice (a wonderfully poignant passage), or the discovery, during a summer living hand-to-mouth in Paris when he was 16, that “even a short-lived visit to the bottom level of society means that one is faced with one of the most important decisions one has to make in life: what type of society do you want to help to create?”. By the time of his diagnosis, this is the question that has come to dominate his life – and he simply cannot forget the problem of the toxic waste soon to be buried at Onkalo and elsewhere. Noting the massive climate changes that this planet has endured, as well as catastrophic geological events that have literally moved mountains, Mankell cannot see how that promise – 3,000 generations of safety – can be even remotely credible, when the oldest human-made structures now standing have only endured for around 6,000 years (or 200 generations). The difference – 94,000 years – is staggering, he notes, and he adds: “Nothing created by man will ever come close to the task we have before us – the task at which we must succeed.”</p> <p><em>Quicksand</em> is an extraordinary book, mixing the intimate detail of memoir (the incidents from his childhood and early life are told beautifully, and with wonderful economy) with the moral beliefs of a man whose concern with social justice has dictated the pattern of his mature years. At times Mankell can sound like a latter-day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/seneca-a-life-emily-wilson-absorbing-account\" title=\"\">Seneca</a>, and he brings the same gravitas and moral authority to bear on his arguments: if, as he says, “there is no court that can take action on a global scale and prosecute the criminals responsible for failing to tackle poverty and starvation with all available means”’ then “that should force all of us to become involved and accept responsibility”. <em>Exiguum est ad legem bonum esse</em>: anyone who enjoys the privilege of time and health must do more than simply be good according to the law. Meanwhile, as the day of reckoning approaches and Mankell waits to hear if he has “a breathing space”, he asks himself what the happiest event of his life had been. That incident should not be disclosed here, but it is typical of Mankell’s seriousness – appropriate and exemplary in an age of celebrity gossip and all manner of frivolous pursuits – that he makes the choice he does. As we come to the end of what has been a deeply serious, and highly uplifting book, the story he tells, of one day in Maputo, is profoundly moving in its choice of hope over despair, and its resolution never to be “robbed of one’s happiness”.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>Quicksand</em><strong> </strong>for £14.99 (RRP £18.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/378743/s/quicksand//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Told through the eyes of thirteen-year-old Ursula Hildesheim, it’s partly a novel about the effects of war but also about growing up.</p> <p>The novel begins with Ursula the child recounting how she has always been afraid of St. Nicholas coming to her house to punish her for her sins and ends with an Ursula who seems much older and wiser than her tender years. </p> <p>My Own Dear Brother details Austria’s journey from being ruled by Nazi Germany to being ruled by Soviet Russia and whilst the soldiers in the war are struggling, Ursula is struggling alongside them. From the moment her best friend Schosi is taken away to the infamous Hartburg Hospital and she and Herr Esterbauer embark on a quest to retrieve him, to the terrifying months after the Soviet soldiers first arrive, bringing rape and destruction with them, My Own Dear Brother is twisted from beginning to end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ac19300cdf53e9aac94a991d396e00dd653a49e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5ac19300cdf53e9aac94a991d396e00dd653a49e/0_0_247_400/247.jpg\" alt=\"gf\" width=\"247\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On the surface, the novel is simply about the war but if you look a little deeper, it’s about love and loss in a society where people have been numbed to pain and sorrow. However, whilst the characters might have been anesthetised, we are able to feel their sorrow for them and whilst I can’t say too much more without giving the game away, I can tell you that death is not the only source of pain in Müller’s novel; sometimes the pain comes from within us and one of the most painful things in life is the things that we try so hard to forget.</p> <p>My Own Dear Brother is captivating and haunting from the first page until the last which is why I was thrilled when I was given the chance to review it by the Guardian Children’s Books team. I haven’t been able to put it down from the moment it arrived on my doormat so sadly my copy is now extremely dog-eared!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

appalling pay?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Writers and publishers are in it together, I tend to feel. Not always in a cuddly way. Sometimes more in a screaming-down-the-mineshaft way. But in one critical respect the partnership feels increasingly strained.</p> <p>Last month, the Society of Authors wrote an open letter to publishers <a href=\"http://www.societyofauthors.org/soa-news/international-calls-action-creator-contracts\">calling for better, fairer contracts</a>. To quote US media lawyer David Vandagriff, publishing contracts “stand apart from the general run of business agreements as conscience-shocking monstrosities”. Think supermarkets and small dairy farmers. Think, as Philip Pullman recently put it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/06/philip-pullman-society-of-authors-open-letter-fairer-terms-for-writers\">steamrollers and ants</a>.</p> <p>The Society called for publishers not to hold on to rights that they don’t actively exploit, not to add crippling restrictions on writers’ other work and to stop insisting that authors contractually indemnify them against all risks. It also wants ebook royalties to rise from 25% to 50%, to fairly reflect the lower cost and risk of digital publication.</p> <p>No writer has a right to be published. If you’re an avant garde poet, good luck to you – you’ll need it. The issue is when the publisher makes money out of a book and the author doesn’t; when contracts exploit the desperate asymmetry of the parties’ negotiating strength.</p> <p>And without reform, according to the Society of Authors, professional writers may become “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/06/philip-pullman-society-of-authors-open-letter-fairer-terms-for-writers\">an endangered species</a>”. That is to no one’s advantage, not to a culture that values extended thought. Not to a society that does not want writing to be monopolised by the wealthy. Virginia Woolf sustained her “room of her own” on the £400 yield from the family money she had invested, but not everyone is so lucky. The situation doesn’t benefit publishers, either, for whom diversity is vital.</p> <p>Responding to the Society’s campaign, the then chief executive of the Publishers Association, Richard Mollet, wrote that “publishers share the frustration of the author community” that it is increasingly difficult “to make a decent living” from writing.</p> <p>“Decent” is a dream. Authors are traded according to perceived value, so few ever admit publicly how little they actually earn. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/08/authors-incomes-collapse-alcs-survey\">a 2014 survey by the Authors Licensing and Collecting Society</a> found that professional full-time authors typically earned £11,000 – a median down 29% on 2005. Of course, a few writers make fortunes. But talk privately to authors – including well-known, much-loved and “bestselling” authors – and you’ll find many in financial distress and professional despair.</p> <p>Richard Mollet felt the source of the problem lay not in “contractual relations” but in “deeper market factors”. Margins are indeed “being squeezed across the whole supply chain” – yet publishers’ profits have not, on the whole, tumbled by 29%. As for “there simply being more writers”, as he also claimed, quality has always been hard to find, even in a buyers’ market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/15/authors-open-letter-call-boycott-festivals-that-do-not-pay\">Authors call for boycott of festivals that do not pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’d like to make an analogy here with another recent author outcry: over literary festivals that don’t pay writers. Festivals pay their lighting technicians, caterers and electricity suppliers, went one of the better arguments. So why not authors? Publishers pay printers. They pay rent – often for staggeringly high-value London commercial properties, despite those squeezed margins. And they pay salaries.</p> <p>Rates for lower-ranking editorial staff are shocking. £16,000 for a graduate? In London? And yes, unpaid and low paid internships are rife, despite the damage they do to diversity. (A recent survey by the Society of Young Publishers found that 38% of respondents got their first job through internships – half of them unpaid.) But even the lowliest shuffler of proofs gets more than £11,000 a year.</p> <p>Of course, it is and should be a market. And, of course, many books do not make a profit any more than every festival speaker draws a crowd. But publishers don’t, in the general course of things, try to screw down every supplier to the absolute minimum possible contractual terms. Maintaining the quality of the relationship, longer term, would militate against that.</p> <p>So when a publisher tells you he “shares your frustration”, ask him how much he earns – and quite how little he’d pay his lowest paid editorial assistant before he felt he was exploiting the vulnerability of their position. Before he felt he was endangering the long term sustainability of his business. Publishing is a market, but it is also a fragile ecosystem, and right now we are losing not just individual writers but entire species of authors.</p> <p>• James McConnachie is a writer.

If my enemy does not understand something, that’s because he is an idiot. If I do not understand something, that’s because it’s pretentious. Alternatively, I think I do understand something, but I want to stake my claim to having a superior right to work with such materials. This fellow, on the other hand, has got ideas above his station: he is pretentious. The use of “pretentious” as criticism is a smug, knowing wink to one’s presumed peers, and a mocking laugh at the unfortunate inferior.</p> <p>We hear constantly of pretentious films, pretentious TV dramas and pretentious modern art. In many cases these things will deserve to be criticised, but calling them “pretentious” is a lazy and vacuous way to do it. Writing and other arts are criticised as pretentious when they seem to aim at the highfalutin aesthetic or intellectual stratosphere while lacking the chops to see it through. But that, of course, is an inevitable risk of any ambitious creative work. To employ the word “pretentious” against it is empty as criticism, because all it means is “not good”; but it is disgustingly full as moral injunction: it means that it is better not to try at all than to try and fail. All art aspires to something it cannot achieve. All art is pretentious. And that is a good thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/09/in-defence-of-pretentiousness\">In defence of pretentiousness | Dan Fox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some writers complain about the pretentious use of words, as though the very act of writing down words and hoping that others will read them and approve of one’s ideas is not itself fantastically pretentious in the first place. In his celebrated essay on computing, “In the Beginning Was the Command Line”, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/oct/14/onlinesupplement14\">Neal Stephenson</a> says that it is pretentious to speak of “navigating” around a document. If such innocent metaphors are pretentious, whither fiction and poetry? Many such complainants are channelling George Orwell’s attack, in “Politics and the English Language”, on “pretentious diction”: here he inveighs against words we today find perfectly normal, such as extramarital, impermissible or predict. The example of Orwell shows that “pretentious” is the put-down of choice for a certain sort of bluff, meat-and-potatoes Englishman who distrusts foreign words and complicated ideas. But to present oneself as such is itself very often pretentious – as it was for Orwell.</p> <p>Even the more rarefied kind of intellectual may call his colleagues pretentious when seeking to curry favour with a certain readership and engineer a heroic self-image as an impatient straight-talker. The philosopher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/karl-popper-enemy-uncertainty\">Karl Popper</a>, in his 1972 paper “Two Faces of Common Sense”, laments “the widespread anti-intellectual attitude which was so strong among the National Socialists, and which is again becoming strong among disappointed young people, especially students”. Such anti-intellectualism, he argues, is “if possible a little worse even than the pretentious and spurious, though sometimes quite brilliant, verbiage of philosophers and other intellectuals”. But the very use of the word “pretentious” here, as usual, signals anti-intellectualism. Popper, while pretending to be an enemy of anti-intellectualism among the young, feels free to indulge in it himself by calling other philosophers mere emitters of “pretentious verbiage”.</p> <p>The moronising accusation of pretentiousness, its blockheaded call to turn off our brains, if anything, is growing more common in our day, when everyone’s a critic on the internet. “On comment threads and online reviews lurk those for whom no creative project or act of criticism is ever quite good enough,” Dan Fox notes soberly. “Trolls are often the first to call out pretentiousness.” Against the trolls, beautifully, Fox here wields classical etymology, having noted that “pretentious” derives from the Latin for extending forwards. “The pseudonymous troll who trashes someone or something for being pretentious is, ironically, themselves being pretentious, holding in front of them a digital mask, a shield of clay.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc2e3ab62cc8f914e53bcf9c1da601a59fc8dbbd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dc2e3ab62cc8f914e53bcf9c1da601a59fc8dbbd/0_0_2268_3372/673.jpg\" alt=\"Musician Howard Devoto\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musician Howard Devoto says ‘pretentiousness is interesting’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fox’s brief and elegantly righteous essay on pretentiousness is definitely on the side of the angels, if arguably not quite pretentious enough. Its compacted historical sketches sometimes dissolve into mere lists namechecking a series of films or writers, while much of the book muses on the notion of authenticity, and explores the history of the theory of acting – in which everyone is indeed pretending. (Fox might have quoted Marlon Brando here: “Each of us in his own small way contributes to the aggregate pretension: national pretension. Nobody likes to admit it. He would much rather say: I am always right.”) But the author, who edits the art magazine Frieze, shines when focusing on the particular: he robustly defends individual artworks from the charge of pretentiousness, and there is a lovely sequence about the power of ideas in 1980s pop music. He quotes the musician Howard Devoto: “Pretentiousness is interesting. At least you’re making an effort. Your ambition has to outstrip your ability at some point.” Or, as Browning put it: “Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, / Or what’s a heaven for?”<br /></p> <p>The most important contribution of Fox’s argument, perhaps, is his claim that what really deserves to be damned as pretentiousness is not an aiming-up but an aiming-down. “Anti-intellectualism,” he notes, “is a snobbery … The anti-intellectual is often anxious not to be marked as part of an educated elite.” And it is inverse snobbery in all its guises that might deserve to be called pretentious in a bad way. Fox approvingly cites Pulp’s “Common People” (1995), and comments: “Prolier-than-thou pretension is insidious”, because it “simply reaffirms class prejudice”. The lesson applies equally to Orwell slumming it intellectually as well as physically in London and Paris, and to our patrician politicians who adopt estuary accents. So we have got our idea of pretentiousness upside-down. To employ the word “pretentious” as a weapon against art that aspires to something difficult is to enforce social hierarchies of power. But when those in power pretend they have less than they do, that is truly pretentiousness without honour.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>Pretentiousness</em><strong> </strong>for £10.39 (RRP £12.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368201/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

As if, ‘My God, what am I doing here, doing these stupid, repetitive movements?’” </p> <p>The realisation that sex can be at one moment ecstatic, and the next absurd, is rarely acknowledged in literature. That seems a shame, particularly for descriptions of teenage sex where heightened expectation and limited experience can make the delusions more real, the failures more profound. </p> <p>The 15-year-old narrator of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">Submarine</a>, my first novel, conducts research before his first sexual experience, taking notes from his schoolfriends, pornography, the unillustrated Kama Sutra, and from listening to his parents through the wall. He wants to last longer than his father. When he and his girlfriend do have sex, he keeps trying to imagine grim things – senile maculation, smokers’ lungs – as a way to slow himself down. But, after a certain point, his self-consciousness falls away and he enters into a fantasy world in which both he and his girlfriend are enjoying a life-changing and flawless sexual masterclass.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most of the time, sex is not fully serious, nor fully romantic, and to pretend so feels unconvincing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> It’s true that comic sex is a hell of a lot easier to write than serious or romantic sex. But I think that’s largely because, most of the time, sex is not fully serious, nor fully romantic, and to pretend so feels unconvincing. I’d like to think that even Romeo and Juliet, the original love-addled teenagers, must have broken their reverie for a moment to note the bad smell in Friar Laurence’s cell, or the bumps in his mattress. Most sex scenes are short so that the writer can avoid mentioning these moments of awkwardness – peeling off socks, rolling on condoms – yet to me, it’s where characters feel most human.</p> <p> The other big challenge is in choosing the right sex words. So many synonyms for penis but which one fits the mood? It’s tempting to reach beyond the classics and try for an exotic metaphor but that’s how a character might end up with a “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/24/morrissey-what-we-learned-about-him-from-list-of-the-lost\">bulbous salutation</a>” like the young lover in Morrissey’s debut novel. It’s often best to keep it simple.</p> <p>One way I’ve found to tackle the problem is to pass on anxieties about word choice to the character. In this way, the bookish narrator in my novel acknowledges his journey from awkwardness to arrogance by changes in his diction. He begins with an erection that becomes a stiffy that becomes his cock, his rock-on, his hotrod, his wang then finally – as he achieves full delusional self-belief – his dong, a word that sounds like someone important has arrived.</p> <h2>MIDDLE AGE<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephaniemerritt\">Stephanie Merritt</a> (who also writes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris\">SJ Parris</a>): ‘It took three books for my spy to get laid’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f4a9a50e64975536d51a8a840ff5c57b8e272046\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f4a9a50e64975536d51a8a840ff5c57b8e272046/1358_0_2933_3006/976.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Merritt also known as SJ Parris\" width=\"976\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Merritt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greatest hurdle for anyone who sits down to write a sex scene is the knowledge that your mother is going to read it. Or your father, your colleagues, the other parents at the school gate and probably, one day, your child. I pity my son in this regard; I’ve managed to reach my 40s without ever acknowledging that my parents know anything about sex, so I can only imagine the level of discomfort I would feel if my mother had ever committed anything explicit to print. </p> <p>Writing sex scenes is by its nature extremely exposing. Whatever kind of sex you’re writing about, whether it’s wild, celebratory, tender, violent or deliberately shocking, there’s no way to pretend you haven’t thought about those acts for long enough to describe them in detail.</p> <p>As with every other aspect of fiction, people have a wilful tendency to assume there must be an autobiographical element to sex scenes. This can be particularly awkward when your partner reads them. Even though he understands how fiction works, you know that somewhere in the back of his mind he’s wondering if any of it’s based on him, or – worse – other people, or whether you’re describing things you wish you were doing.</p> <p>In a way, of course, it’s impossible to escape the personal. If I’m writing an erotic scene between my characters, I usually want the reader to find it enjoyable as well as satisfying in narrative terms, and the best way I can try to achieve that is to write something that I find appealing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want readers to find erotic scenes enjoyable – and the best way to achieve that is to write something I find appealing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There’s also the question of how we define “sex”. The truth is that describing the act itself quickly becomes repetitive and boring. That’s one reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fifty-shades-of-grey\">Fifty Shades</a> is such a spectacularly dull book. Context and build-up are everything, and often less is more. I once heard Germaine Greer refute the notion that there is no sex in Jane Austen. Austen is full of sex, she countered, there just isn’t any fucking, and only the most unimaginative would confuse the two. In fiction, as in life, delayed gratification can be far more charged. One of the most erotic books I’ve read is Alessandro Baricco’s novella Silk, where the seduction takes place entirely through letters and stolen glances.</p> <p>When I started writing <a href=\"http://www.sjparris.com/books/\">my historical crime series</a> featuring the 16th-century philosopher and spy Giordano Bruno, I was cautious about how much sex to include. It took three books before I finally got him laid, but allowing him to be seen in this most intimate of encounters made him more vivid to me as a character. It was also the first time I’d written about sex from the first-person perspective of a man, which was an intriguing exercise in empathy and anatomy. </p> <p>I like to think I’ve become more relaxed about writing sex scenes. My eighth book, Conspiracy, is the raunchiest of the series. It’s set in the Parisian court of Henri III, notorious for its cross-dressing and erotic parties. My mother has just finished reading it. She told me she enjoyed it very much. We didn’t make eye contact.</p> <h2>OLD AGE<br />Arlene Heyman: ‘Sex in one’s 70s? It can be better’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"80840a784e87fd69cc36e8bf4965f08a419bcc10\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/80840a784e87fd69cc36e8bf4965f08a419bcc10/581_23_1703_2154/791.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Heyman\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Heyman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My impulse is to say<strong> </strong>I don’t write about sex, not specifically. I write serious literature the best I know how– and find that sexuality often says a good deal about characters as human beings. But why do I need to start out this way, with a disclaimer? Well, writing about sex remains a taboo-breaking enterprise no matter the age of the writer – and some of my stories portray sex among older people. What’s more taboo than that?<br /></p> <p> While Freud tried to teach us that children are sexual beings and some of us almost accept the idea, rarely do we think the same of old people. The aged are represented as eccentrics and hypochondriacs and meddlers; they can be cuddly and cute, and they are often widowed<strong>, </strong>to remove the risk that we’ll think of them in a sexual situation<strong> (</strong>Jane Austen’s Mr Woodhouse, for instance, meets all these criteria). </p> <p> And we old people often collude in our disappearance as sexual human beings. An 86-year-old woman friend of mine told me it was “so sweet” that a female acquaintance in her 90s, who’d had a six-month relationship with a man her age, left him because he was unfaithful. My friend seemed to think it a weird prodigy that people in their 90s were having sex at all – who would care about a trivial detail like cheating? This from a woman who was having weekly loving sex with her 84-year-old husband and would have been murderous had he strayed. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 79-year-old friend told me, for him, sex is better now: his wife knows her body better and tells him what she needs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What are the facts about sex in one’s 70s? It exists aplenty, especially for people in good health<strong>, </strong>who are married,<strong> </strong>who have good social networks<strong>. </strong>A 79-year-old male friend told me that, for him, sex is better now: his wife knows her body better and tells him what she needs. Sex is a friendlier act, there can be a real kindness to it. There is great pleasure in seeing a long-beloved creased face. <br /></p> <p> Why then do so many people not want to think the aged have sex? I believe it’s because of oedipal taboos. Children don’t like to think of their parents having sex. They protect themselves from their own wishes toward their parents by finding the idea of anything sexual to do with them disgusting. Old men and women should be grandparents. They should want to be with the grandchildren. They should not want to be with each other in bed. </p> <p>I think it takes a certain amount of bravery to try to write well and honestly about sex, whatever your age. But sex among the aged – disgusting! Who wants to be seen as disgusting? However, <em>not </em>writing about it means distorting the experience of millions of people who want – who need – to see their full humanity represented. <br /></p> <p> I do so want to be brave. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/371187/\">Scary Old Sex by Arlene Heyman</a> is published by Bloomsbury; <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/submarine.html\">Submarine by Joe Dunthorne</a> is published by Penguin; <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/292770/\">Conspiracy by SJ Parris</a> is published by HarperCollins on 4 May.<br /></li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4g86c","wordcount":"1547","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/970953ee2f4740feea3edd67ae93a555cce22998/34_49_472_283/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-14T07:00:11Z","standfirst":"<p>Should you use exotic euphemisms or anatomical detail?

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him.

He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
