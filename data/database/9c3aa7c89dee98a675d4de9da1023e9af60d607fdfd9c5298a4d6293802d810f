in Europe”, the only surviving letter written by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lady-Mary-Wortley-Montagu\">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</a> from Turkey has gone up for sale.</p> <p>Written in April 1717 from Adrianople, now Edirne, to her long-time correspondent Mrs Frances Hewet, the letter sees Lady Mary talk of her “Journeys through Hungary, Bohemia, &amp; the whole Tour of Germany”. Turkey, she tells her “dear” Mrs Hewet, “is one of [the] finest in the world; hitherto all I see is so new to me, it is like a fresh scene of an opera every day”. Her husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, was ambassador to Turkey at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9a3e2ecb01a2c04eca18720e53bb435af6f04f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a3e2ecb01a2c04eca18720e53bb435af6f04f65/0_495_2080_3044/683.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu from 1720.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernard Quaritch Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The letter also mentions her son, saying that he “never was better in his life”. Lady Mary vaccinated her son against smallpox in Turkey.</p> <p>“In this letter she confirms his continued health, which suggests that this letter dates from after his inoculation,” said the antiquarian bookseller Bernard Quaritch, which has put the letter up for sale for £5,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\">Lady Mary would go on in England in 1721</a>, in the middle of a smallpox epidemic, to have her daughter inoculated against the disease. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, “the practice of inoculating children spread rapidly among those who knew Lady Mary and who had already been bereaved by the disease”. “Lady Mary’s most important activity during the 1720s, for the world if not for herself, was the introduction to western medicine of inoculation against smallpox,” says the dictionary of the poet and letter writer, who was a friend of Alexander Pope but became estranged, the latter attacking Lady Mary in his Dunciad in 1728.</p> <p>Bernard Quaritch called the letter “unique”, as it is the only original to survive of all those Lady Mary wrote from Turkey. “It’s a wonderful thing,” said bookseller Mark James. “She was an incredible woman.”</p> <p>The 18th-century missive is the star of a new catalogue from Bernard Quaritch celebrating 250 years of women travellers. The catalogue also features a copy of Margaret Mee’s Flowers of the Brazilian Forest, one of only 400. Published in 1968, her book identifies three flowers previously unknown to science. It also includes a rare first edition of Baghdad Sketches, the first book by British writer and explorer Freya Stark, who would go on to be one of the first non-Arabians to travel through the southern Arabian Deserts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"52cebec0ca4fae2b6f4bf65de3c46ca666352842\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52cebec0ca4fae2b6f4bf65de3c46ca666352842/0_0_3174_4562/696.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Mee’s Flowers of the Brazilian Forests (1968)\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plate from Margaret Mee’s Flowers of the Brazilian Forests (1968).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernard Quaritch Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sale includes a 1763 second edition of Lady Mary’s Embassy Letters, about her travels with her husband on his posting to Turkey. The author rewrote her letters on her return to England and circulated them to her friends in a manuscript. They were published after her death and proved hugely successful, going through three editions in 1763.</p> <p>James pointed to a preface to the letters written by Mary Astell in 1724, arguing that female travel writers are superior to their male counterparts. “I confess, I am malicious enough to desire that the world should see to how much better purpose the ladies travel than their lords; and that, whilst it is surfeited with Male-Travels, all in the same tone and stuffed with the same trifles; a lady has the skill to strike out a new path, and to embellish a worn-out subject, with variety of fresh and elegant entertainment,” writes Astell.</p> <p>“If you say women travellers, people tend to think of those from the second half of the 19th century,” said James. “But we wanted to stretch out the spectrum, to pull it back and forward, so we’re covering 250 years.”</p>","wordcount":"613","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-21T09:45:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v7y5","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c68b42373772e9f7041b73891e280e9a081d253e/489_2552_2892_1735/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/manuscripts","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Manuscripts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/manuscripts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/manuscripts","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK

stroke on the night of 1 March 1953. He had the best personal security protection, but none of it “could prevent him lying for hours in his own urine, paralysed, and without the ability to scream”. Servants and guards were worried about his non-appearance but afraid to disturb him. When his colleagues were finally called, they hovered uncertainly before finally calling a doctor – not Stalin’s personal physician, since he and a number of his colleagues had recently been arrested as traitors in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors%27_plot\" title=\"\">the Doctors’ Plot</a>. The terrified man recommended “absolute quiet; the application of eight medical leeches to his ears; a cold compress on his head; an enema of milk of magnesia; and the removal of his false teeth”. Stalin died without regaining consciousness on the evening of 5 March.</p> <p>His closest colleagues did not kill him, despite much speculation that Joshua Rubinstein rightly deflates. But neither did they strive officiously to keep him alive. Stalin, whose health had been poor and ability to work diminished for some years, had become extremely suspicious, not just in general but specifically of them. He had launched an antisemitic campaign about which they were very dubious. He may have been gearing up for a new round of purging and deportations. Thanks to ruthless repression and belt-tightening, the country was back on its feet economically after the huge losses of the second world war. But Stalin was in no mood for introducing measures to improve living standards that many felt were overdue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stalin’s closest colleagues did not kill him, despite much speculation that Joshua Rubinstein rightly deflates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His last days make a dramatic story and Rubinstein tells it well – with particular attention to the anti-semitic campaign on which, as author of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/30/arts/30BERN.html\" title=\"\"><em>Stalin’s Last Pogrom</em></a> (2001), he is an expert. But it’s what happened next that is really interesting. More than half of this newbook is devoted to the year after Stalin’s death, when his old gang – the Politburo members, including Vyacheslav Molotov, Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev, who had worked with him for many years – took over, and, to almost everyone’s astonishment, launched immediately into wide-ranging fundamental reforms, including attempts to improve relations with the west.</p> <p>My own book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/27/on-stalins-team-sheila-fitzpatrick-review-living-dangerously-soviet-union\" title=\"\"><em>On Stalin’s Team: the Years of Living Dangerously in Soviet Politics</em></a>, published last year, covers some of the same ground as <em>Stalin’s Last Days</em>, though neither of us knew that at the time of our respective writing. But whereas my focus is on domestic political developments, Rubinstein’s is on the foreign and international dimensions. It is a fascinating and at the same time disconcerting story. If you grew up, as I did, with John Foster Dulles as cold war villain and bogeyman of the left, you may subsequently have wondered if he could possibly have been as bad as he was painted. Judging by Rubinstein, who is fair-minded almost to a fault, the answer is yes.</p> <p>The speed and energy with which the new leaders embarked on reform was breathtaking. Already, at Stalin’s funeral, the new head of government, Malenkov, was talking about détente and the new security boss, Lavrenty Beria, about legality and constitutional protections. Within weeks, the antisemitic campaign was called off and the (mainly Jewish) Kremlin physicians accused in the Doctors’ Plot exonerated and freed. In short order, a million prisoners were released from the Gulag under an amnesty, the powers of the security police curtailed, more consumer goods and public housing promised, cultural controls loosened, and overtures made to the west about improving relations.</p> <p>Rubinstein gives a fair account of all this, if a slightly grudging one. “We can dismiss the possibility that it was an act of conscience,” he writes of the new leaders’ repudiation of the Doctors’ Plot, although in fact there is substantial evidence that Stalin’s close colleagues had disliked and passively resisted his antisemitic initiatives in 1952. Rubinstein takes a similar approach to the reform programme in general, ruling out the possibility that the new leaders actually thought change was needed and concluding that they must simply have been pursuing some “pragmatic advantage”, albeit one whose nature is unclear – perhaps a “signal to the west”?</p> <p>Certainly the Soviets wanted to signal their interest in easing cold war tensions. In the US, however, this was not a message people wanted to hear. A new administration led by President Dwight Eisenhower and secretary of state Dulles had taken office in January 1953 on a programme of getting tough with the Soviets and “rolling back communism”. Soviet communism was the villain of the piece, and it was disconcerting, to say the least, if it stopped playing its role properly. Time magazine found the new developments “bewildering, welcome, sinister.” Dulles was adamant that, regardless of conciliatory Soviet overtures, the US must “keep our pressures on, psychological and otherwise”. For Dulles, in the opinion of New Yorker writer AJ Liebling, Soviet relaxation was in fact a threat to US policy aims, as it might “de-frighten Europeans”.</p> <p>There were other more positive responses in the west to Soviet overtures. In Britain, the shrewd and well-informed Soviet expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/26/russia.theobserver\" title=\"\">Edward Crankshaw left Observer readers in no doubt</a> that something momentous was happening. Winston Churchill, nearing the end of his political career, saw a historic moment that needed to be seized, and wrote to Eisenhower to tell him so. But Eisenhower was “horrified” when Churchill called in the House of Commons for a summit as an appropriate response to post-Stalin changes in the Soviet Union. Dulles was categorically opposed to any face-to-face meetings with the Soviets, either public or private. Critical observers discerned in him an “almost superstitious fear”. Perhaps he realised that, if you have successfully turned your enemy into a devil with horns, you don’t want to give him a chance to look human.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75f670e7cce1a5f108063e818e6ff77e701a74a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75f670e7cce1a5f108063e818e6ff77e701a74a3/537_833_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US President Dwight Eisenhower and secretary of state John Foster Dulles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US President Dwight Eisenhower and secretary of state John Foster Dulles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erich Lessing/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubinstein’s verdict is that, in the crucial months between Stalin’s death in March and the Berlin uprising in June of 1953, the US missed a great opportunity to meet the new Soviet leaders halfway. This was partly because of poor information and advice: experts told Eisenhower that Stalin’s successors were even more dangerous and aggressive than he had been. Eisenhower himself wanted to speak over the heads of Soviet leaders to the Soviet people, who might be encouraged to rise up and overthrow tyranny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Communism was the villain of the piece, and it would be disconcerting to the US if it stopped playing its role properly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rubinstein states in his introduction that “for complex reasons both Soviet and western governments could not overcome the decades of distrust that divided them”. But, when you reach the end of his clear and judicious analysis of the events of 1953, that isn’t quite the conclusion that suggests itself. A summation of “fault on both sides” is usually a safe bet, and it certainly works for the origins of the cold war in the second half of the 1940s.</p> <p>It would no doubt have been fully appropriate in the hypothetical situation that the west had responded to Soviet overtures in 1953, only to have détente turn sour because of problems on both sides, including internal Soviet disagreements. But that is not what happened. By Rubinstein’s own account, the Soviets made the first and subsequent moves, and the US turned them down flat without even trying to find out how far they were prepared to go.</p> <p>Dulles, with his extraordinary belief that the Soviet threat as of 8 May 1953 constituted “the most terrible and fundamental” in the last 1,000 years of western civilisation, was the prime mover of this rebuff. Thus the responsibility for the missed opportunity for some kind of détente after Stalin’s death appears to lie squarely with the US.</p> <p>• To order <em>The Last Days of Stalin</em> for £20.50 (RRP £25) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/last-days-of-stalin.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

And I really, really hate apocalyptic fiction. So my choice for the books to give you hope series? Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven: a book about the end of the world.</p> <p>When Station Eleven was first published almost two years ago, I read the press release, flipped through it and put it on my pile of books I’ll probably never get round to. I didn’t need another dose of post-apocalyptic bleakness in my life.</p> <p>I really do hate this kind of fiction. I’m the man who’s never seen The Walking Dead and has no intention of ever doing so. The end of the world just isn’t for me. Why would it be? It’s an awful, awful place. I don’t want to immerse myself in a world where civilisation has reverted to barbarity, where every day is a grinding battle just to survive until the next day, when it all begins again. What is there to enjoy in a ruined world where people fight over water and food? Where it’s kill or be killed? Where women seem to be routinely reduced to commodities to join the list of scarce resources to be scrapped over?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel-haunting-dystopian-vision\">Station Eleven review – Emily St John Mandel’s haunting dystopian vision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I kept picking it up again, and flipping through, even as Mandel’s “incomplete list” of things that the post-ruin world has lost forever chilled and depressed me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No more diving into pools of chlorinated water.</p> <p>No more porch lights with moths fluttering on summer nights.</p> <p>No more trains running under the surface of cities.</p> <p>No more cities …</p> </blockquote> <p>I must have been feeling particularly bleak one day, because I sat down to read it. And I was captivated.</p> <p>Station Eleven’s apocalypse is wrought by the Georgia Flu, a virulent disease that races across the planet, kills within hours and wipes out 99% of the world’s population. Mandel switches between the day the pandemic hits her native Canada and the world 20 years later. </p> <p>And while the ground zero stuff is as terrifying and horrible as you’d expect, the revelation comes in the chapters set two decades after the supposed end of the world. Because it hasn’t ended at all.</p> <p>It’s not the world we know, or would want to. It’s a mess, it’s lawless, it’s chaotic and it’s brutal. But, as I ripped through the book, I realised it was offering what other apocalyptic fiction never seemed to even bother with.</p> <p>Hope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While survival is vital, it isn’t enough. We must live as well as survive, because otherwise what’s the point?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And not just hope that eventually we’d rebuild and repair and jump-start society all over again. Station Eleven offers a different type of hope – that amid the horror of collapse, humanity doesn’t always have to revert to savagery.</p> <p>The 20-years-later chapters focus on an itinerant group of actors and performers called the Travelling Symphony who move around the rudimentary settlements built in the ruins of Canada and the northernmost tip of the US, bringing Shakespeare to the survivors. Offering them not just a glimpse of how things were, but – crucially – how things can be again.</p> <p>But not in terms of subway trains and swimming pools and “towns glimpsed from the sky through airplane windows”; instead how art and beauty can not only survive, but thrive. And through them, so can we.</p> <p>The caravan of the Travelling Symphony has a quote from Star Trek incongruously painted on the side (though many of the players are too young to even remember the pre-Georgia Flu world): “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_Instinct_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)\">Survival Is Insufficient</a>.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2014/oct/10/books-podcast-literary-dystopia-fiction\">Literary dystopias with Emily St John Mandel and Clemens J Setz – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That’s not to say that there aren’t horrors and thrills in Mandel’s apocalypse. The chaotic first year after the Flu strikes is alluded to in dark tones, but never explored too deeply, and there are brigands and mad prophets aplenty; this is no pastoral idyll of a future world.</p> <p>Yet the strength of the novel is that it doesn’t concentrate on mere survival. That is taken as read. But as the wisdom of Star Trek teaches, survival is vital, but it isn’t enough. We must live as well as survive, because otherwise what’s the point?</p> <p>I still hate apocalyptic fiction. But I love Station Eleven, and if I have to live through the end of the world – God forbid! – I really hope Mandel is writing

storytelling and human drama","byline":"Elizabeth Lowry","body":"<p>JM Coetzee’s Man Booker-longlisted sequel to his 2013 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/27/childhood-of-jesus-jm-coetzee-review\"><em>The Childhood of Jesus</em></a> poses an intriguing question: when is a novel not a novel? The driving energy of the book, like that of its predecessor, is philosophical rather than narrative: at this stage of his career, Coetzee is far more concerned with ideas than character or plot (which have never, it has to be said, been the main strength of his terse, enigmatic fiction – rarely has a writer so effectively managed to turn his limitations into a trademark). He has always preferred to construct novels that generate their own paradigms, that operate outside recognisable historical or geographical settings, and even outside recognisable psychologies. The Coetzeean landscape is eerily stripped down, often physically rudimentary, like a <a href=\"https://zoowithoutanimals.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/de-chirico_melancholia-1916.jpg\">vista by De Chirico</a>: a featureless arena in which colossal philosophical questions cast long shadows.</p> <p>In <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>, however, the scenery is so flimsily assembled that it could come straight from Ikea. The book picks up where the first one left off, in a nameless country where everyone speaks Spanish and where refugees arrive on boats, are given new names and identities, and are “washed clean” of all their old memories and associations. The capital city is Novilla, a socialist utopia whose citizens are without desires or appetites (the standard fare is bread and bean paste) but are fond of having ad hoc philosophical debates in their breaks from comradely manual labour. These conversations are all rendered in Coetzee’s stilted, courtly idiom, which feels oddly apt here, reading as if it might indeed be a translation from Spanish into English.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The scenery is so flimsily assembled that it could come straight from Ikea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one in the novel is called Jesus. The Jesus of the title alludes to a motherless refugee child named Davíd who, in the previous volume, is taken under the wing of Simón, an earnest middle-aged man not entirely happy with this brave new world. Simón recruits a suitably virginal young woman, Inés, to be Davíd’s new mother, but their makeshift family unit is threatened when the boy, who has unusual intellectual gifts, begins to resist the officially approved methods of learning and is sent to a reformatory. (He escapes.) The end of the first book sees the holy family in flight, following a star – their destination the “sprawling provincial town” of Estrella.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65b0080dbca61b90a9889b2653f61501652e49d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b0080dbca61b90a9889b2653f61501652e49d4/0_0_5150_3430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the Place d’Espagne, Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reckless romancing or stolid pragmatism? … statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the Place d’Espagne, Brussels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em>The Childhood of Jesus</em>, Simón hazards that “We are like ideas. Ideas never die,” and in the sequel, too, it is ideas that matter. What actually happens is secondary, designed to move us on from one open-ended debate to the next: what is the nature of the created world? Of love? Of freedom? Of the self? Above all, of passion? Once in Estrella, Davíd is enrolled in the local Academy of Dance, run by the severe Ana Magdalena, who has the “alabaster” beauty of a classical statue and who instructs her pupils in a mystical “dance of the universe” that purports to map out “a higher realm where the numbers dwell”. With her “perfect features, perfect skin, perfect figure, perfect bearing”, and chilly commitment to Platonic mumbo-jumbo, Ana Magdalena is the ultimate representative of this strange utopia’s idealising tendency. “Bloodless, sexless, lifeless”, she has all the detachment of the ideologue. Ideologies do not equal passion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his fidelity to instructing rather than seducing, Coetzee does not actually write fiction any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the book, it is Simón who champions the “primacy of the personal” over the communal, abstract ideal; of clay over marble. As the novel’s Joseph figure and Davíd’s protector, Simón is an indefatigable guide through these Socratic dialogues, always ready to “produce the correct, patient, educative words”. The paradox is that, in spite of being the voice of individualism, he is another of Coetzee’s self-abnegating protagonists, who approaches passion at a slant, dispassionately. Simón is a prim pedant, a killjoy, disapproving of dogs and sausages and inventing one’s own stories to go with the pictures in a book.</p> <p>Never is this more apparent than when Coetzee invites us to consider philosophies of fiction. Why is Spanish the language spoken in his invented world? Because it is the language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/classics.asbyatt\"><em>Don Quixote</em></a>, the Ur-novel, one of the first to pose the question of what realism is and what fiction is for. Which is more “real”, more useful in navigating our existence: Quixote’s reckless romancing or Sancho Panza’s stolid pragmatism? <em>Don Quixote</em> (or a children’s illustrated version of it) is the book that Davíd uses to teach himself to read. In <em>The Childhood of Jesus</em>, it becomes the springboard for an exchange between Davíd and Simón about the nature of fiction. “You can look at the page and move your lips and make up stories in your head, but that is not reading,” warns Simón:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For real reading you have to submit yourself to what is written on the page. You have to give up your own fantasies. You have to stop being silly. You have to stop being a baby.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Simón is “a dry old stick”, Davíd – rather like the historical Jesus, one imagines – is, in his sense of authority and conviction, his dogged rejection of systems, genuinely uncanny. Davíd (who roots for Don Quixote, the fantasist, rather than for Sancho Panza, the drab realist) knows instinctively that it is “the hole between the pages”, the tapping into our own fantasies, that makes fiction fiction and makes reading pleasurable. His natural affinity is for the transgressive, in particular the novel’s “man of passion”, a voluble murderer called Dmitri who ruminates at length on guilt and justice (“don’t ever let them forgive you, and don’t ever listen when they promise you a new life”). Dmitri’s country of origin is clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\">Dostoevsky</a>.</p> <p>Simón is greatly exercised by the question of passion, but pleasure, rather than passion, is the real problem in <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>. It is by now apparent that this mysterious Spanish-speaking country, this place of refugee souls, stands for our embodied earthly life: “The boat docks at the harbour and we climb down the gangplank and we are plunged into the here and now. Time begins.” The name “Novilla” suggests both a place of new beginnings and the genre in which the characters find themselves, the novel itself – that ultimate, well-worn site of inventing things anew.</p> <p>So, what are stories for? Are they for grownups or babies? In spite of its declared suspicion of Platonic idealism, the spirit of Plato, rather than the anarchic Jesus with his boundary-pushing parables, hovers over this book. Plato was famously dismissive of the seductive properties of mimetic literature, which urge us to make an imaginative identification with a fictional world. He would have agreed without hesitation that novels are for babies. Philosophy is for adults. On the evidence of this austere, barely realised mise-en-scène, it is difficult not to feel that Coetzee, like Plato, is no longer much interested in the accidents of our quotidian human world, the shadows on the cave wall. He is after essence alone, the pure, ungraspable fire. In his fidelity to ideas, to telling rather than showing, to instructing rather than seducing us, he does not actually write fiction any more. <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>, philosophically dense as it is, is parched, relentlessly adult fare – rather like eating endless bread and bean paste.</p> <p>• To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/schooldays-of-jesus.html\"><em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em></a> for £14.75 (£17.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person”.</p> <p>“There are only homo or heterosexual acts.

For the release of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxecELnxMYU\">1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet</a>, which revealed the gay subtexts in a number of famous Hollywood movies, the celebrated playwright, essayist and author of controversial 1948 novel The City and the Pillar revealed he rewrote scenes in the early part of the 1959 biblical epic Ben-Hur to hint heavily at a prior sexual relationship between Charlton Heston’s title character and his childhood friend (and later betrayer) Messala (Stephen Boyd).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxecELnxMYU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxecELnxMYU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The revelation caused a storm in the letters pages of the Los Angeles Times in 1996, with Heston accusing Vidal of exaggerating his part in writing the screenplay and denigrating the good name of the film’s director, William Wyler. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/la-et-me-gore-vidal-charlton-heston-archive_1_gore-vidal-ben-hur-sam-zimbalist\">In his reply to the Times, Vidal</a><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/la-et-me-gore-vidal-charlton-heston-archive_1_gore-vidal-ben-hur-sam-zimbalist/2\"> revealed</a> there was good reason for the film’s star to have been unaware of the Ben-Hur/Messala relationship’s gay subtext, as no one had dared tell him about it before the shoot. But he confirmed that he had discussed the matter with Boyd, who duly followed the screenwriter’s lead for the key scene in which the boyhood chums meet again after many years apart. The initially reluctant Wyler, Vidal claimed, had also come around to his way of thinking at the last gasp. Heston made no further reply.</p> <p>These old wounds are opening once again thanks to comments made this week at the Los Angeles premiere of the film’s current remake, which stars Britain’s Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell as the former boyhood buddies who find themselves on opposite sides of the racial and religious divide in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. Asked if the new version would address Vidal’s reading of the relationship between Ben-Hur and Messala, <a href=\"https://www.aol.co.uk/entertainment/2016/08/17/benhur-gay-subplot-not-necessary-in-2016-says-star-toby-kebbell/\">Kebbell told the UK Press Association</a>: “It wasn’t something we avoided but it wasn’t something we had,” then added: “In 1959, the gay context was very important. They need a voice. You shouldn’t have to hide in the dark about something you feel and you’re grown with. That was their own thing they wanted to portray and we didn’t need to. It’s a different time, thankfully.”</p> <p>At the same premiere, producer Roma Downey seemed to be siding with Heston’s interpretation of the facts. “I don’t even know if that was true in that film,” she told PA. “Here we have two brothers. They love each other. They’re raised in the same household and it’s so tragic to see their family just ripped apart.”</p> <p>So here we have one key cast member suggesting there is no need for a gay reading because the battle for equality has been won in 2016. And a producer (one, by the way, who is best known for her part in the creation of the CBS faith drama <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108968/\">Touched By an Angel</a>) sweeping the entire subtext under the carpet. Might this be something to do with the fact that studio Paramount has rather built up the part of Jesus, a minor player in the original, with the aim of pulling in Bible belt audiences to see the remake? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/03/glaad-calls-for-gay-characters-in-star-wars-episode-viii\">Glaad calls for gay characters in Star Wars: Episode VIII</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If so, this feels like a missed opportunity. At a time when Glaad has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/25/glaad-hollywood-films-failing-gay-people\">repeatedly called on Hollywood to improve the visibility of positive gay characters in major movies</a> – especially given the prominence of LGBT leads on the small screen in hit TV shows such as Orange is the New Black – it would surely have made more sense to explore Vidal’s reading. And not just for the sake of diversity.</p> <p>Vidal’s main reason for rewriting those early scenes in the 1959 version was to create a realistic and meaningful explanation for Messala’s betrayal of his adoptive brother. And he’s right, isn’t he? Only a jilted lover would behave as the Roman tribune does, ripping Ben-Hur from his gilded existence as a wealthy Jewish prince and throwing him into a life of poverty as a galley slave, not to mention sending his best friend’s mother and sister to prison, where they contract leprosy. The usual explanation for Messala’s cruelty, that he is responding to the near-death of a Roman dignitary hit by falling tiles from Ben-Hur’s ill-kept roof, simply doesn’t cut it. </p> <p>As Vidal explained in his letter to the Times:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the years, I have told the story of how, faced with a hopeless script for Ben-Hur, I persuaded the producer, Sam Zimbalist (this was an MGM film and the writer worked not with the director but the producer; later the director, in this case William Wyler, weighed in) that the only way one could justify several hours of hatred between two lads – and all those horses – was to establish, without saying so in words, an affair between them as boys; then, when reunited at picture’s start, the Roman, played by Stephen Boyd, wants to pick up where they left off and the Jew, Heston, spurns him. This is the scene that was shot and this is the scene that viewers of The Celluloid Closet watched, with my commentary. Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan wrote that “seeing an appropriate clip makes a strong case for the truth of Vidal’s assertion that Boyd was in on the scheme while Heston was not.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But Vidal’s version of events clearly doesn’t fit the marketing plan, isn’t part of the faith-based narrative and has therefore been excised almost completely from the new version. We’re told Messala has a genuine reason to be upset with Ben-Hur in the Timur <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Bekmambetov\">Bekmambetov</a>-directed remake, which loses those famous falling tiles in favour of a naughty zealot hiding out at the Jewish nobleman’s house who shoots the visiting dignitaries when his benefactor’s not looking. </p> <p>What a pity that in clearing up a historical anomaly, the remake has missed its target in other rather more vital ways. Heston would no doubt have been pleased. Vidal, one suspects, less so.</p>","wordcount":"1048","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-20T17:30:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v86e","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a152dff4324fcf868f0e30ac5b2a3bcb1a6657e/0_163_4896_2938/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"film/film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/gore-vidal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Gore Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gore-vidal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/gore-vidal","references":[]},{"id":"film/charltonheston","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Charlton Heston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charltonheston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/charltonheston","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"US Arts and Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Child","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Child is a Guardian film writer and the blogger behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/week-in-geek\">The Week in Geek</a></p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426761348767/Ben-Child.jpg","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","twitterHandle":"BenChildGeek"}],"elements":[{"id":"7a152dff4324fcf868f0e30ac5b2a3bcb1a6657e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a152dff4324fcf868f0e30ac5b2a3bcb1a6657e/0_163_4896_2938/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Lovers no more ...

A Guggenheim, a Whiting award, and one of those MacArthur “genius” fellowships. His books had been shortlisted for many prizes, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/colson-whitehead\">a Pulitzer</a>. But Oprah’s touch still has its own particular kind of publicity magic, and so Whitehead finds himself answering the question: where was he when he heard the news?</p> <p>“I had a reading at Duke, and my plane touched down. I’m always checking my phone as soon as I hear the landing gear go down. There’s [a call from] my agent,” he tells me over the phone. “I called her back and she said: ‘Oprah.’ I said: ‘Shut the front door,’ because I didn’t want to curse. She said: ‘Oprah book club.’ I said: ‘Motherfucker.’ People were looking at me because this was on the airplane.”</p> <p>Had Whitehead been able to explain to his fellow plane passengers, they would no doubt have understood. But there is some cloak and dagger involved in being blessed by the <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/oprah-winfrey-explains-free-car-giveaway\">One Who Gives Away Cars</a>.</p> <p>“They said it’s a secret and you can’t tell anybody, and if you do, we’ll destroy you,” Whitehead jokes. “So four months of lying to people. It was a huge relief two Tuesdays ago when I finally was able to tell people. Two days before, I told my wife. Two days before my daughter was at sleep-away camp, and had no access to electronics, so she had one phone call. I was like: ‘I’ll tell you Tuesday. Since you have no way of telling anybody, I’ll let it out of the bag.’”</p> <p>The book appeared in American bookstores the day of the announcement, even though it had previously been scheduled for publication in the US on 13 September. (The book will be available in the UK on 6 November.) American literary Twitter began joking that Whitehead had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kermichele/status/760481140406910976\">pulled a Beyoncé</a>, dropping a surprise book. Not unlike Lemonade, The Underground Railroad sold like hot cakes, hitting No 4 on the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/hardcover-fiction/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Books&amp;referrer&amp;region=Body&amp;module=CompleteListLink&amp;version=Fiction&amp;pgtype=Reference\">hardcover fiction bestseller list</a>. But for Whitehead, things obviously didn’t happen that quickly. In fact, The Underground Railroad was 16 years in the making.</p> <p>The book follows Cora, a young slave in Georgia who escapes her brutal life on a plantation with the help of that fabled element of the slave era, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/underground-railroad\">the underground railroad</a>. In Whitehead’s retelling – though not in real life – the railroad is an actual subterranean train. One or two cars roar through a system of tunnels, with stations buried underneath the houses of sympathetic southern whites. Cora travels through South Carolina and Tennessee before ending up in Indiana. In the New Yorker this week, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/the-perilous-lure-of-the-underground-railroad\">Kathryn Schulz praised Whitehead’s handling of the subject</a>: “It is a clever choice, reminding us that a metaphor never got anyone to freedom.”</p> <p>Some reviewers have remarked that the Underground Railroad’s spareness is a departure for Whitehead, a novelist known for his comedic touch. He has had a varied career, moving from the slightly fantastic in his 1999 debut novel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/07/reviews/990207.02kristex.html\">The Intuitionist</a>, to the solid realistic account of 2009’s <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-colson-whitehead26-2009apr26-story.html\">Sag Harbor</a>, to the zombie-apocalypse plot of 2011’s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/15/141236169/zone-one-what-happens-when-zombies-take-nyc\">Zone One</a>. When I asked him about it, he said: “Growing up watching Kubrick, it seems like a normal thing. You do your dark comedy, you do your war movie, you do your science fiction movie, and it’s all accessing different parts of your personality.”</p> <p>The idea that the Underground Railroad was an actual train had been the idea that inspired this latest book. “I was thinking about how when you’re a kid, when you first hear about the underground railroad, you visualize a literal subway. Just because the image is so evocative,” Whitehead told me. “I thought, what if it actually was a subway?” His imagining of the book unfolded from there, informed considerably, he said, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/poll/2013/oct/07/100-novels-swift-gullivers-travels-mccrum\">Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels</a>. He imagined the slaves traveling from state to state, and that the story would “reboot” every once in awhile, showing some different aspect of America.</p> <p>But initially Whitehead wasn’t sure he was up to executing the idea. He wasn’t sure he had become the sort of writer that could pull it off, and besides, the prospect of researching slavery, “a gruesome topic”, was not appealing. So years went by, and he wrote other novels while the idea continued to germinate. Finally he had begun to work on a book about a journalist in New York, and the voice seemed too close to the voice Whitehead had used in his nonfiction book about poker, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/04/22/299072740/exclusive-first-read-colson-whiteheads-the-noble-hustle\">The Noble Hustle: Poker, Beef Jerky, and Death</a>. “It seemed like repeating myself, and also if I put off this slavery idea for so long, why not try to confront why I was trying to avoid it?”</p> <p>The wait was apparently worth it. Over time, Whitehead tells me, he dropped his onetime plan to have this be something of a fantastical story. Originally he thought, for example, that the Underground Railroad would transport the characters to different eras; instead, in the end, the action of the book all takes place in 1850. He spent a lot of time rereading slave narratives, the famous published ones like those of <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/frederick-douglass\">Frederick Douglass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.harrietjacobs.org/\">Harriet Jacobs</a>, as well as narratives collected in the 1930s by the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-wpa/\">Works Progress Administration</a>, which collected oral history from then-still-living former slaves. “They gave me enough material, in terms of slang and the kind of food they ate, in order to get going,” Whitehead said. “So it was four months before I felt ready to go.”</p> <p>One of the most remarkable things about the Underground Railroad is Cora’s level-headedness in the face of the suffering and tragedy she both encounters and experiences herself. Another sort of writer, one more sentimental than Whitehead, might have been tempted to ratchet up more open emotionalism. Instead, his book does not make a big show about Cora’s stoicism, and Whitehead came to believe it followed logically from the horror of slavery. “I think when all you’ve known is atrocity, how do you rank the latest atrocity with the rest?” he told me.</p> <p>Whitehead had in mind several grand schematic novels while composing the book. In high school, he took a class called Fabulism, and there he read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/25/marquez-one-hundred-years-solitude\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/23/100-best-novels-pilgrims-progress\">John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress</a>, and Kafka. These books, alongside Gulliver’s Travels, informed the structure of Cora’s journey. “Any kind of adventure story where someone goes from allegorical episode to allegorical episode, and escapes at the last minute, that sort of outlandish series of events actually works for an escaped slave. You are just going from slim refuge to slim refuge trying to make it out.” He has a point, and the critics, who have all given The Underground Railroad rave reviews, seem to agree that Whitehead fastened on exactly the right metaphor. This, many people are saying, may be the novel that wins Whitehead the Pulitzer.</p> <p>This all comes at a time where there has been so much talk about diversity in publishing and in pop culture. I ask what Whitehead thinks of the debate. “I think progress is slow. Year by year I think we have more and different African American writers making their debuts. I was allowed to write about race using an elevator metaphor because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pw.org/content/david_bradley_2\">David Bradley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/27/fiction.reviews\">Ralph Ellison</a>. Hopefully me being weird allows someone who’s 16 and wanting to write inspires them to have their own weird take on the world, and they can see the different kinds of African American voices being published.</p> <p>“If you go to a big publishing house, editorial aside, it’s completely white,” he adds. “Stories written about black people or featuring black protagonists have become big or get a lot of attention, and then three years later it’s back to the same draft. Not to be negative, but I always see it as a ... You want to point to The Underground Railroad and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/09/writers-best-books-summer-2016\">[Yaa Gyasi’s] Homegoing</a> as the year black people broke through, [but] three years from now, you’re not going to have that same story.”</p>","wordcount":"1414","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-20T17:30:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v8b2","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c6cc57cfaf8392a631d5541b133d9774a441ba1/0_12_1200_719/500.png"},"tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television

On the face of it, not much: surfing is a frivolous pastime and war reporting a humanitarian endeavour to shine a light on violent conflict in ways that put the observer’s life on the line. However, the parallels between the two haunt journalist William Finnegan’s <em>Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</em>, his acclaimed memoir about 50 years spent chasing the best waves on the planet. Nowhere are these parallels more explicit than in the aftermath of a brutal surf session on Madeira, where Finnegan is almost killed by a wave, “a hideous, boiling, two-story wall of whitewater,” that momentarily sucks the deep ocean dry before crashing down upon him. Shaken by his proximity to death, he asks his wife Caroline why she “didn’t get angry about all the stupid risky things I did,” like “war reporting” and “surfing.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/19/barbarian-days-a-surfing-life-william-finnegan-review\">Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life by William Finnegan review – one hell of a ride…</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If <em>Barbarian Days </em>eschews delving into this parallel, it is perhaps because for a reporter to dwell on personal emotions amidst the pervasive human suffering he witnesses would be obscene. By contrast, the subject of a life spent surfing the iconic waves of the planet, such as Honolua, Tavarua, Kirra, Ocean Beach, and Jardim, gives Finnegan a canvas for the array of emotions elicited by encounters with violence—perhaps because surfing entails immersion in natural beauty. These emotions include discovery, fear, and “a dopamine rush that was both familiar and rare, that required nerve and experience.” There is hardship, deprivation, physical drubbing, injuries, and “near-drowning.”</p> <p>Finnegan also experiences the awe inspired by majestic waves. Here he is on Tavarua, in Fiji, riding the last wave of the day:</p> <blockquote> <p> The wave felt like a test of faith, or a test of sanity, or an enormous, undeserved gift. The laws of physics appeared to have been relaxed. A hollow wave was roaring off into deeper water. Not possible. It felt like a runaway train, an eruption of magical realism, with that ocean-bottom light and the lacy white canopy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Such encounters with beauty are most intense in <em>Barbarian Days </em>at what Finnegan calls “the fear line.” Throughout the memoir, magical waves become, in an instant, mortally dangerous, as in Finnegan’s close brush on Madeira. When the surfer crosses the fear-line, the absurdity or even madness of the surfer’s practice is palpable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/06/william-finnegan-new-yorker-surfing-memoir\">William Finnegan: 'I was reluctant to come out of the closet as a surfer'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finnegan has organised <em>Barbarian Days </em>as a chronicle of his initiation into surfing, which he consistently links to a friend or companion who becomes his subject, and who leads him from the waves into surrounding social scenes. Finnegan discovers the “siren song” of surfing, for example, as young teen in Hawaii, together with school friend Roddy Kaulukukui, who helps him navigate the racial tensions among <em>haoles – </em>white non-Hawaiians – and Hawaiians vividly depicted in the first chapter of his memoir. Finnegan’s anthropological focus then shifts from land society to surfers’ camaraderie, portraying an inwardly focused, male society held together by bonds of friendship, local knowledge, and aggression. This fraternity shares a code of silence, the source of which Finnegan is reticent to explain — his own capitulation to its authority.</p> <p>Finnegan’s memoir stands out among the slim literature on surfing for the glimpses it offers into bonds among men who organize their lives around tide, wind, swell, and the treacherous topographies of the coast. Some of these attachments are affectionate, such as Finnegan’s friendship with Roddy. Or, later in life, living in New York, with the dancer John Selya, whom he portrays running off to perform in Twyla Tharp’s <em>Movin’ Out</em> after a morning charging harsh surf in an ice storm off Long Beach. Other bonds are more ambivalent; notably, Finnegan’s relation to the oncologist Mark Renneker, known locally as Doc, who leads the daredevil surfers at San Francisco’s brutal Ocean Beach. The subject of Renneker and the Ocean Beach surfers was, indeed, Finnegan’s first foray into surfing anthropology, in the form of a 1992 <em>New Yorker </em>article titled “Playing Doc’s Games.” Renneker, Finnegan recalls, “hated it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db41256bbb736f5fefd62fd5587ad44184a0ddc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db41256bbb736f5fefd62fd5587ad44184a0ddc7/0_84_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italo Ferreira flies through the air after pulling out of a wave as Kelly Slater paddles past during the 2015 World Surf League Fiji Pro at Cloudbreak off Tavarua island, Fiji.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italo Ferreira flies through the air after pulling out of a wave as Kelly Slater paddles past during the 2015 World Surf League Fiji Pro at Cloudbreak off Tavarua island, Fiji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirstin Scholtz / WSL HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finnegan’s willingness to expose outsiders to surf fraternities places his book in a lineage of classics about what seaman and author Joseph Conrad called “the bonds of the sea.” Finnegan’s barbarians take their place next to Richard Henry Dana’s comrades before the mast, Mark Twain’s riverboat pilots, and the myriad seamen contending with storms and human error in the tales of Conrad. Finnegan is the first to insert surfing into this bookshelf of seafaring literature, and he does so as an anthropologist and coastal oceanographer, possessed with a fine literary sensibility. Notably, while he describes the ocean with a surfer’s technical jargon, he imbues surfing practices with emotions, making them accessible even to the non-surfing reader who may not grasp the import of specific details.</p> <p>Such an ability to bring outsiders inside technical knowledge is one for which sea writers have long been famed. We do not need to understand the intricacies of sailing to recognise that the young captain has dangerously taken his ship too close to land at the end of Conrad’s “The Secret Sharer,” when the captain’s mate exclaims: “She will never weather, and you are too close now to stay. She’ll drift ashore before she’s round. Oh my God!” Similarly, we do not need to know what it means to be “trapped in the impact zone” on a “10-foot west set,” “taking each wave on the head, ditching my board, diving deep, getting cruelly rumbled,” to understand Finnegan’s submission to the ocean one evening on Oahu.</p> <p>Finnegan calls this submission at Sunset a “baptism.” Religion permeates his descriptions of surfing, from the time when the “junior atheist” learns of the power of the gods in pre-Western Hawaii to <em>Barbarian Days’</em>s final scene. Refusing theology, this memoir is nonetheless steeped in its figures of speech: “baptism,” “the test of faith,” “hands raised in prayer,” and so on.</p> <p>Finnegan is not the first to identify the religious quality in surfing. The sport’s Hawaiian roots as a spiritual practice of harmony with nature are regularly contrasted to the western quest for nature’s domination in writing on surfing. Finnegan, however, refuses this romanticism. The deity presiding over Finnegan’s vision is the Hawaiian fire goddess Pele, whose demands for sacrifice and “jealous and violent” nature reflect the cruelty of the ocean. Finnegan’s sense that he can only explain the thrall of surfing as a harsh mysticism is reaffirmed in the memoir’s final scene, set at the evocatively named Cloudbreak in Fiji — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/22/surfing-new-wave-william-finnegan-pulitzer-prize\">reputed to be among the most challenging waves in the world</a>. The session begins with a figuratively sacrificial moment, when Finnegan falls badly and hits his head, bleeding from the throat. The local boatman, a “square-shouldered goofyfoot [someone who surfs with his left foot on the back of the board] named Inia Nakalevu,” steps forward to help him take waves safely, accompanying his guidance with a catechism — of some sort — on the sublime altar of the reef.</p> <p>“Do you know God, Bill?” Inia asks, as he selects waves for Finnegan, in conditions so dangerous that a wipe-out might result in death. “Do you know God loves you?” “Not really,” the avowedly atheistic Finnegan answers, refusing “the dark-skinned evangelist’s” faith, even as he owes his preservation to Inia’s exquisite local knowledge. A marvelous athlete, “Inia … had it bad,” Finnegan comments, adding addiction to the mix.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/02/william-finnegan-pulitzer-prize-barbarian-days-surfing-memoir\">Pulitzer winner William Finnegan 'didn't want to be stereotyped as a dumb surfer'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is surfing?

The hygienist tells him that her father once lured a lamb-worrying coyote to its death using a recording of her infant sister crying. It’s a sufficiently curious tale for Searcy to take the father’s number; but for obscure reasons he delays contacting the resourceful rancher for a year. Meanwhile the essay meanders about until Searcy makes up his mind, touching on the author’s bad attitude towards dental floss, his encounters with giant turtles and toads, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-maps\" title=\"\">Google Maps</a> view of the ranch he has failed to visit. When at last he gets there he discovers the hygienist’s father also has tapes with titles such as Raccoon Fight and Grey Fox Distress. The final import of the essay is voiced by the man’s wife, who takes Searcy’s visit as a chance to ask: “Why did you let her cry?”</p> <p>The essay form, Theodor Adorno wrote in 1958, “freely associates what can be found associated in the freely chosen subject”. The 21 essays in <em>Shame and Wonder</em> take full advantage of the genre’s arbitrariness, its habit of digression and urge to reveal unlikely affinities. In “The Depths of Baseball Sadness”, Searcy considers his own digressive temperament: “What on earth do you call that? Fielder’s taken off his glove to get down on his knees and build little houses out of rocks for ants.” Searcy’s method and style consist of extreme concentration on anecdote or detail, followed by unexpected swerves of thought and phrase, taking us somewhere quite different. As a writer he resembles the friend of his youth who, he tells us, aspired to live suspended beneath a neighbour’s huge pink Cadillac: nose to the asphalt and no inkling where he is headed.</p> <p>His method appears to have its origins in his childhood in the 1950s, when he had a wide open attitude to the future, schooled on specific cultural artefacts. As a boy he persuaded his parents – quite how is mysterious – to buy him a Danish modernist armchair: “All the hard, pragmatic thrust and brace smeared out into those curves in such a graceful contradiction that knew how, exactly how, to take the weight without constraining one’s position.” It seemed that he (and by extension the US) would speed comfortably into a future imagined by his favourite TV shows, such as <em>Space Patrol</em> and <em>Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</em>. But he felt some resistance already: young Searcy’s homemade space rockets fizzled and fell over, his homemade seismograph (a jury-rigged gramophone) registered only “unlikely properties, effects oblique and subtle and evasive” – tremors from the imagination, in other words.</p> <p>His experiments may have failed but Searcy maintained an affinity with scientists. “Is science everywhere, like metaphor and tragedy?” he asks. The answer might be that, whatever else it is, science is Searcy’s best source of metaphors. He recalls that after his divorce, his daughter, alone in her new bedroom for the first time, resembled an astronomer keenly focused on her telescope, with her face pressed to the dark. Astronomy, space travel and science fiction give Searcy a sense of the oddness of the world in which he grew up and a fund of the best images to describe it. It’s hard to read his account of a mid-1950s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/07/mickey-rooney-obituary\" title=\"\">Mickey Rooney</a> TV show, <em>The Moon or Bust</em> – in which the heroic dope thinks he has made it to the moon but is actually in a local field with a cow – and not go looking for the episode online, to marvel at the simplicity of its estrangement.</p> <p>At times Searcy’s combination of quotidian amazement and apparent nostalgia can seem banal or twee. The heart sinks when an essay begins, as “Cereal Prize” does, by musing: “I suspect a broader meaning to our breakfast cereal back in the 1950s.” And it’s permissible to wonder what a more eccentric and dogged practitioner of the essay such as Nicholson Baker would do with the topic of paper-aeroplane design. But then you realise that the first of these is about fundamental kinds of longing that are not exhausted by plastic toys in Puffed Wheat boxes, and the second concerns a childhood friend who later died in a motorcycle crash. “You can see what’s going on here, right? The unforeseen stabilities. The buoyancy. The darkness … ” The links and leaps that Searcy makes can appear too swift and even glib, the scale of the essay too easily tipped from reminiscence to revelation. But in “Cereal Prizes” the pivot is perfectly timed: it comes at the end, and unbalances the whole.</p> <p>Searcy is a novelist who has turned to the essay in his late 60s. His publishers tell us he writes his non-fiction “straight up” on notepad and typewriter, as if that were some guarantee of authenticity or commitment. I doubt Searcy himself believes such guff, but he does have a tendency to perform a certain old-guy remove from current technology: he finds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/08/google-maps-10-anniversary-iphone-android-street-view\" title=\"\">Google Maps</a> “ghostly”, and is alarmed to find himself invited online to “Fuck Sexy Girls near Dallas”. This habit of claiming to be down-home and detached is maybe one of the reasons <em>Shame and Wonder</em> arrives trailing cloudy blurbs from the likes of Leslie Jamison and John Jeremiah Sullivan. Searcy looks like the latest in a long line of outsider(ish) American essayists. It’s a redundant gambit, on his part and his handlers’, because at its best – “The Hudson River School”, the paper-plane essay, a remarkable piece about Max Fleischer cartoons – his work enacts odd connections between past, present and future, without having to telegraph their presence.</p> <p>• Brian Dillon’s <em>The Great Explosion</em> is out in paperback.

From George Eliot to John Updike, here are some who have","byline":"Jane Rogers","body":"<p>Barry Hines once told me that the novel he’d just finished reading was so good that he felt it was pointless to carry on writing his own. We had to agree to disagree. When I read something brilliant, it makes me itch to write. There are three truly great novels about long marriages that I have waited decades to engage with in writing. (Which is not to say that I imagine myself at their level, but, as the old saying goes, a cat may look at a king.) </p> <p>Those novels are: The Tree of Man by Patrick White, The Rainbow by DH Lawrence and John Updike’s Rabbit novels. All three follow a marriage from beginning to end so minutely that the reader sees with new eyes the shifts and fascinating complexities within that age-old relationship, usually regarded as so dull that it only appears as a backdrop to other people’s interesting infidelities.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/10/conrad-and-elanor-by-jane-rogers-review\">Conrad &amp; Eleanor by Jane Rogers review – two perspectives on a dying marriage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conrad-eleanor.html\">Conrad and Eleanor</a>, I wanted to write about a long marriage and the balance of power between two equally matched partners. I wanted to explore the ways in which memories can shift in light of later events, and the ways in which love can turn to hate and back to love again. I was interested in giving equal space to both partners’ voices and I was keen to explore the fallout from reversed gender roles in a marriage where there are children. </p> <p>I chose “marriages” rather than “relationships” for this list because I am fascinated by the baggage that marriage carries. It is a template for living together and procreating that has been implanted in us by the Bible, by history, by literature, by custom. We still subscribe to the fairytale of it – all those white weddings – and give it tax breaks. It is not sexuality-specific; lesbians and gays subscribe to it as enthusiastically as heterosexuals. Most of us hunger for monogamy, even as we yearn for its opposite. </p> <p>And that’s the subject of these 10 books: how does a couple live together, over years, over decades? What does each understand of the other; what do they gain, what do they lose? What <em>is</em> a long marriage, and how on earth do people do it? In the parts that therapy and Relate cannot reach – in the body and the heart and the imagination, what <em>is</em> this ideal so many of us feel we must live? Surely only fiction can tell.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tree-of-man.html\">The Tree of Man by Patrick White</a> (</strong><strong>1956)<br /></strong>Young Stan Parker clears a patch of Australian bush and builds a log house. Over time, he brings along bits of furniture and crockery on his horse and cart, and eventually he brings his new wife Amy. They are as innocent and isolated as Adam and Eve. Over time, people build on neighbouring plots. Children are born, the bush is ravaged by fire and a neighbour murders her brother. Stan and Amy both hope for revelation and meaning in their lives. The constant to-ing and fro-ing of their (often mistaken) understanding of one another is held steadily in focus. </p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rainbow.html\">The Rainbow by DH Lawrence</a> (</strong><strong>1915)<br /></strong>A Nottinghamshire farmer falls in love with a Polish widow, and marries her. She already has a daughter, and they go on to have two more. The novel spans 30 years. Like Patrick White, Lawrence uses free indirect style to fully reveal his characters’ thoughts, but what is more extraordinary is how he manages to convey tectonic shifts of emotion, of distance and closeness, that neither character can articulate. <strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></strong></p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rabbit-run.html\">Rabbit, Run by John Updike</a> (1960)<br /></strong>I’m really recommending four books here. The three that follow are Rabbit Redux, Rabbit is Rich, and Rabbit at Rest, which together span the lives and lifelong marriage of Janice and Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom. For much of Rabbit, Run, Updike puts Harry centre stage and restricts the novel to his point of view, chronicling his edgy hunger for freedom and sex, his affair with buxom Ruth, his frustration with his job and his dozy alcoholic wife. So when the novel switches to Janice’s point of view – hurt, betrayed, drunk and utterly incapable of looking after a baby daughter – the effect is electrifying. Janice’s character gains strength as the novels progress, and this blackly comic version of marriage is as eye-opening and sexy and convincing as any I have read.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/28/middlemarch-george-eliot-martin-amis-as-byatt\">Middlemarch by George Eliot </a>(1871-2)<br /></strong>This great classic<em> </em>contains an impressive variety of long marriages, each finely drawn and in contrast to its fellows. There’s Lydgate, with his idealism and adoration of Rosamond’s beauty, who is brought up short against her simple selfishness; Dorothea, whose self-sacrificing devotion runs aground on the shallows of Casaubon’s self-importance; ruined Bulstrode with his loyal wife; practical Celia and generous Sir James, and sensible Mary Garth with feckless Fred Vincy. Eliot plays with the idea of marriage, the illusions that initiate it, the deceptions and self-deceptions that damage it, the humour and loyalty and selflessness that enable it to survive.<strong><br /></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2098063318d06e164831a736f1ffdf2b85934eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2098063318d06e164831a736f1ffdf2b85934eb/0_169_4076_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Newall (Casaubon) and Georgina Strawson (Dorothea) in Dorothea’s Story from in The Middlemarch Trilogy by George Eliot at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-importance and self-sacrifice Jamie Newall (Casaubon) and Georgina Strawson (Dorothea) in Dorothea’s Story from in The Middlemarch Trilogy at the Orange Tree Theatre in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5.<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/15/anne-tyler-interview-i-am-not-a-spiritual-person-spool-of-blue-thread\">A Spool of Blue Thread by Anne Tyler</a> (2015)<br /></strong>Tyler often writes about marriage, and always writes true. The first 10 pages of this novel are almost entirely dialogue and reveal Abby and Red Whitshank brilliantly. They are arguing helplessly over how to handle a phone call from their son Denny announcing he is gay. Abby theorises that his getting a girl into trouble while he was still at school might have been a symptom of homosexuality. Red asks, “Come again?” “We can never know with absolute certainty what another person’s sex life is like.” “No, thank God.” Their love for one another is as comfortable and worn as the old slippers and colourless dressing gown each wears.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ghana-must-go.html\">Ghana Must Go by Taiye Selasi</a> (2013)<br /></strong>This is not really about a long marriage, because Kweku abandons his family in the US after being pressurised into conducting surgery on a dying woman. He is unjustly blamed for her death and can’t bring himself to tell his wife. He vanishes. They move back to different destinations in west Africa and their children scatter; they never meet again. Yet they are always present in one another’s lives. A romantic, enduringly loving version of marriage, that is paradoxically (inevitably?) only sustained through absence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/15/top-10-books-about-middle-age\">Top 10 books about middle age</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/children-act-283455.html\">The Children Act by Ian McEwan</a> (2014)<br /></strong>McEwan very cleverly reveals just how much the turmoil in Fiona’s marriage is affecting her work as a high court judge. The economy and precision of the writing enable us to glimpse quite vividly her husband’s side of the story, and indeed the whole history of their 35-year-old marriage.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/07/classics.margaretatwood\">To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf</a> (1927)<br /></strong>One of the novel’s many strands, and the one that first fascinated me as a young feminist, is the way it contrasts the complexity of Mrs Ramsay’s married life with the single life of artist Lily Briscoe. The long marriage itself is not precisely the subject of Woolf’s great novel, but the question of what a marriage might give and what it might take away from a woman is a key component.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/21/features.weekend\">Things My Mother Never Told Me by Blake Morrison</a> (2002)<br /></strong>This is biography: the story of Morrison’s mother’s life, revealing all she gave up for her marriage (her Irish family background, her Catholicism, her work as a hospital doctor) and how she reinvented herself for a man whom many might call domineering and who went on to be unfaithful to her. And yet it was a long, solid marriage. Towards the end of it she told her son, “I’ve had a good life.” A fine exploration of the complexity and conundrums of marriage.</p> <p><strong>10. East Coker from Four Quartets<em> </em>by TS Eliot (1943)<br /></strong>I will leave you with a poem. Eliot incorporates a quote from <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/bokenamedgouerno01elyouoft/bokenamedgouerno01elyouoft_djvu.txt\">The Boke named the Governour, 1531</a>, by his ancestor Sir Thomas Elyot, in a passage which beautifully encapsulates marriage as ritual and as nature:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>… if you do not come too close,</p> <p>On a summer midnight, you can hear the music</p> <p>Of the weak pipe and the little drum</p> <p>And see them dancing around the bonfire</p> <p>The association of man and woman</p> <p>In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie –</p> <p>A dignified and commodious sacrament.</p> <p>Two and two, necessarye coniunction,</p> <p>Holding eche other by the hand or the arm</p> <p>Which betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire</p> <p>Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles</p> <p>… Keeping time,</p> <p>Keeping the rhythm in their dancing</p> <p>As in their living in the living seasons ...</p> <p>The time of the coupling of man and woman</p> <p>And that of beasts.</p> </blockquote> <p>I’d be very interested to hear readers’ recommendations of other books on this topic.</p> <p>• Conrad and Eleanor by Jane Rogers is published by Atlantic, priced £12.99, and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conrad-eleanor.html\">is available from the Guardian bookshop for £10.39</a>.</p>","wordcount":"1483","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-28T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v7cd","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c292013a1b9435a50494a2f21a379e06e9d4726/0_261_6292_3777/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/toptens","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Top 10s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/toptens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/toptens","references":[],"description":"Authors choose their favourite books on their chosen theme"},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/ts-eliot","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"TS Eliot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/ts-eliot","references":[]},{"id":"books/dhlawrence","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"DH Lawrence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dhlawrence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/dhlawrence","references":[]},{"id":"books/johnupdike","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"John Updike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/johnupdike","references":[]},{"id":"books/georgeeliot","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"George Eliot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/georgeeliot","references":[]},{"id":"books/ianmcewan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Ian McEwan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/ianmcewan","references":[]},{"id":"books/virginiawoolf","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Virginia Woolf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/virginiawoolf","references":[]},{"id":"books/blake-morrison","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Blake Morrison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/blake-morrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/blake-morrison","references":[]},{"id":"books/anne-tyler","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Anne Tyler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-tyler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/anne-tyler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jane-rogers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Jane Rogers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jane-rogers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/jane-rogers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Jane Rogers is an award-winning novelist, short story writer and radio dramatist.

The new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23women_writers&amp;src=typd\">#women_writers</a> hashtag does just this; a campaign to annex a little corner of the internet for women talking and supporting each other in their shared passion for writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/australias-women-writers-still-get-far-less-attention-than-men-survey-finds\">Australia's female writers still get far less attention than men, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And before anyone says this is not needed, it is: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/07/vida_study_women_read_more_books_but_men_get_to_write_more_book_reviews.html\">women read more fiction than men</a>, yet come up short in both publishing deals and media coverage. The annual Vida (US) and Stella (Australia) counts show consistently that there is a lingering <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count\">bias against women</a>. This picture is slowly improving, but women remain under-represented as book reviewers and authors reviewed. Books by women are scorned as “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/elena-ferrante-covers-bad-no-good/488732/\">domestic</a>”, books about women are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/books-about-women-less-likely-to-win-prizes-study-finds\">less likely to win prizes</a>. One woman writer found that she garnered much better responses to her manuscript when she <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/06/catherine-nichols-female-author-male-pseudonym\">submitted under a male name</a>. Looking at the numbers, it is frankly unsurprising there might exist an insecurity among female writers.</p> <p>There have been grassroots movements and online activities dedicated to promoting female writers and literature in the past, but none has been quite as inclusive as #women_writers. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://womentoringproject.co.uk/\">WoMentoring Project</a> (on sabbatical until November) saw high-profile writers and women in publishing linked with aspiring female writers, agents and editors. However, as the mentorships required an application process and it was sold on the line of “exceptional women supporting exceptional women”, the whole campaign had a certain amount of exclusivity built in. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/read_women?lang=en-gb\">#Readwomen</a> hashtag, spearheaded by literary polymath <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/badaude\">Joanna Walsh</a>, promoted works by women, but only for already published writers. Where was the space for women to whom a book deal was little more than a speck on the horizon?</p> <p>“There seemed to be a gaping hole, when there is such an abundance of women attendees of writing and literature courses, in writers’ groups and at literary festivals,” says Laurie Garrison, an academic, writer and researcher. Garrison runs <a href=\"http://lookingforxanadu.co.uk/courses/\">Looking for Xanadu</a>, a blog that offers courses for women writers, and is also the mastermind behind the #women_writers hashtag. Developed <a href=\"https://storify.com/surfyorks/first-ever-women-writers-chat?utm_source=embed_header\">for a live chat</a> on underrated female writers, the hashtag immediately took off and evolved into a wider conversation on Twitter, serving as a launchpad for women to discuss their own projects. Subsequent Twitter conversations using the hashtag have been themed – a chat on self-publishing and one on women in translation. The next is set to be on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauriebg_/status/760878702918004736\">DIY methods for online marketing</a>.</p> <p>Garrison says that the low proportion of women with book deals is not always the fault of the publishers. Based on anecdotal evidence, she believes women are less likely to send their manuscripts in the first place. “I’ve heard anecdotal accounts of publishers getting more submissions by men from agents, and women being much less likely to send in second submissions even if encouraged to do so when the first hasn’t been accepted – and, even more bizarrely, when the first has,” Garrison says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/18/imposter-syndrome-and-time-issues-why-women-dont-write-non-fiction\">Imposter syndrome and time issues: why women don't write business books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could the “<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/\">confidence gap</a>” and “<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html\">imposter syndrome</a>” perhaps account for this? The confidence gap is a theory that a disparity of self-assurance between women and men is devastating in creative industries, where self-belief can be as important as competence. But Garrison is reluctant to use these terms. “I think it’s become a bit of a sweeping explanation for why women don’t experience as much success as men in a lot of areas,” she says. “It seems to suggest that if we’d all just act as confident as men, the problem would be solved. In other words, it’s the women that need to change their behaviour, not the external world of publishing, education, working environment.”</p> <p>Garrison has now released <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://lookingforxanadu.co.uk/women-writers-in-the-21st-century/\">a manifesto for the #women_writers hashtag</a>, laying out the need for community-building among female writers, for rejecting traditional models of publishing and for building confidence in the face of rejection. A veritable call to arms for would-be women writers, the manifesto also addresses how both men and women are conditioned to emulate masculinised practices in the workplace and how this is not necessary for success in pitching or writing.</p> <p>Almost 20 years ago, Norman Mailer dismissed writing by women as “always fey, old hat, Quaintsy Goysy, tiny, too dykily psychotic, crippled, creepish, fashionable, frigid, outer-Baroque, <em>maquillé</em> in mannequin’s whimsy, or else bright and stillborn”. Five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/02/vs-naipaul-jane-austen-women-writers\">VS Naipaul said there was no living female author who was his equal</a>. And this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/gay-talese-twitter-female-writers\">Gay Talese said he could not name one woman writer he admired</a>. As these attitudes persist, it is Garrison’s view that we need to work to create an environment where women feel they can carve out their own space, regardless. And online, communication, community-building and innovative ways of disseminating writing can be pursued to best advantage, even with all the potential naysayers lurking on the #women_writers hashtag.</p> <p>“We need dedicated spaces for women writers to improve their technique in a non-competitive environment, learn resilience to deal with all the rejection and criticism involved in professional writing and to be able to show vulnerability without being judged,” Garrison says. “If we can create spaces for women writers where these things can be discussed and put into perspective, I think it could go a long way toward levelling the playing field.”</p>","wordcount":"887","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-23T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v3jm","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e20de816bb4fbdc4009a47140116f9580bbd154a/0_19_3750_2250/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Publishing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/women","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Twitter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Internet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lara-williams","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Lara Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lara-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/lara-williams","references":[],"bio":"<p>Lara Williams is an author and freelance writer based in Manchester.

public school is a generous gift. Like the ocean-locked ship or the medieval monastery, it presents the novelist with the kind of closed system that is ideal for testing hunches about the workings of human hearts. When traditions of how to think and behave have been established over centuries, there is a settled inevitability that things will keep on being done the way they’ve always been done. Just by turning up to lessons, you’re deepening the conspiracy.</p> <p>That’s true of the teachers as much as the pupils. In poet Sean O’Brien’s second novel, Stephen Maxwell has recently retired from an unremarkable career teaching history at Blake’s, “a church in light disguise” on the outskirts of a North Sea port. Ostensibly charged with writing the school’s official history, his leisurely obsession is reconstructing the events of 40 years earlier, when the spirit of late-60s revolution unleashed monsters that had little to do with Paris or free love. It is a chronicle of deaths foretold, opening with the cadences of a confession.</p> <p>Blake’s is the only home Stephen has ever had, its inmates his only family. Orphaned young, he is dumped there aged eight, into the care of the dependably charismatic teacher Carson. Stephen discovers girls, intellectual passions and the world beyond the school woods, and hones a talent for romance that belies his semi-monastic upbringing. Embarrassed at university by an affair with a don’s wife, Stephen finds history repeating itself when, as a young teacher returning to the fold, he starts rattling the headboard with the spouse of the school’s mysterious absent headmaster. With her “feral nobility” and age-defying good looks, Maggie is caught up, like everyone else in the novel, in the dealings of General Allingham, Yorkshire’s answer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/19/oswald-mosley-blackshirts-uniform-1935\" title=\"\">Oswald Mosley</a>. An old-school fascist with an eye on a by-election seat, Allingham enlists the unscrupulous energies of Charles Rackham, another denizen of the Blake’s staffroom. When Carson’s body floats to the surface of the school pond, the trail of ex-Blakeans hurrying to investigate seems to extend up to the higher echelons of government. If you get the feeling that everyone in the novel is connected to Blake’s, that’s part of the stifling recursiveness that O’Brien needs for his narrative.</p> <p>This is a bookish book. Within a few early pages, we’ve had quotes from Larkin, Eliot, Hopkins, Dante and Stevenson. Even the villain, Rackham, is defined in terms of his qualities as a poet, which in his case are a mark of irredeemable moral affliction. Characters are individuated by what they like to read, and much of the action unfolds in libraries and bookshops. Pubs make for a welcome change of scene, and the funny banter between young Stephen and his buddy Smallbone contributes to the sort of intellectual slacker feel I enjoyed in O’Brien’s previous novel <em>Afterlife</em>. The dark shadow around Stephen’s university exploits is dexterously handled, and gives the novel an emotional centre that is oddly lost amid all the killings. We are in the territory of Lindsay Anderson’s <em>if…</em>, but instead of an armed insurgence from the pupils, it is the masters who are manning the guns.</p> <p>It’s difficult to manage this mix of violence and absurdity without occasionally straying into the Pythonesque. But having almost all of the characters connected to the school means that the plot can struggle to breathe, and the control of this oddly overdetermined narrative is not always entirely assured. Stephen is a strangely emotionless protagonist, even when horrors are unfolding. The author seems to be interested in a particular distillation of Englishness: “bravery, endurance, an ironic obedience to necessary authority, a readiness to kill for the cause given half a chance”. Where a nationality crystallises as an idea, there will inevitably be people who want to defend it and impose it on others. It’s no comfort to learn from this subtle, compassionate, quietly outraged novel that English fascists in 1968 campaigned to join Europe. As Stephen traces the link between Rackham’s petty English nastiness and his wartime dealings with those who would industrialise racial hatred, he reminds us how readily the conspiracy of the institution can become a refuge for the unspeakable. If the machinery of Blake’s is inexhaustibly able to assimilate and forget, we can thank its fussy self-absorption, its isolation and what Arnold Bennett called a “grim passion for the status quo”.

something much bigger? Soldiers had gone on the rampage before. Although the atmosphere had been tense at the meeting of the National Liberation Council and Riek Machar and several others had stayed away on the second day, there had been no sign at this time that any faction would turn to violence. A South Sudanese friend texted me from the town centre. He had passed the president’s compound on his way home. Soldiers and check points were everywhere. Tanks were moving. Shooting and explosions were becoming louder and closer. </p> <h2><strong>Dark December night</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"81cdb80dddd17a2a8cc1c60dbeeb4c7612776742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81cdb80dddd17a2a8cc1c60dbeeb4c7612776742/0_0_495_796/311.jpg\" alt=\"South Sudan: The Untold Story from Independence to Civil War by Hilde F Johnson, with foreword by Desmond Tutu\" width=\"311\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Was there anything I could do? I had agreed with the president [Salva Kiir] that in a crisis of national magnitude we would immediately be in touch. But I heard nothing from him, the government or his people. Should I call him? I started scrolling my phones.<strong> </strong>Not knowing the scale of this, I decided to get in touch with the security people before I disturbed the president. I should be able to get hold of them. Reports from UN security indicated that the fighting was within the security forces. I checked my watch. It was close to midnight.</p> <p>At around 00.15 the shooting seemed to abate. Was the situation coming under control? Were those involved regrouping? One of my phones rang. It was Majak D’Agoot, the former deputy defence minister and a former SPLA (Sudan People’s Liberation Army) general:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If this is what it seems [...] it can trigger major ethnic killings. Hilde – you have no idea what can happen in this country, but this can set off ethnic violence between the Dinka and the Nuer which can drive us all down. This can become another Rwanda. </p> </blockquote> <p>I had never heard Majak like this. He urged me to call both the president and Riek Machar and ask them to make a public statement calling for restraint and for an immediate cessation of violence. “You are the only one who can reach both of them and convince them,” Majak said. He thought if their respective forces heard such an instruction from their leaders, they would stand down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/jul/01/south-sudan-fifth-birthday-written-on-the-body-messages-peace-loss-unity\">Written on the body: messages of peace, loss and unity from South Sudan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>....</p> <p>I tried to get to Riek on the five or six mobile numbers I had for him. The phones were either switched off or unanswered. I sent the same text message to all the phones, asking him to call me back. At 3am my phone rang. It was Riek, from a new and unknown number. I urged a public statement calling for calm and asking forces loyal to him to stop the violence. He asked whether the president was going to do the same. I told him that I had spoken to the key security ministers and that I expected to speak to the president very soon. Riek said that he would consider a statement if the president would do the same. He said that his situation was now so serious that he had considered seeking refuge in a foreign embassy. He did not ask for UN protection or other assistance from Unmiss, and I made no offer. I still thought it possible to stop the violence, and said that he now was needed to take control of forces loyal to him and to prevent further bloodshed. At that point we had not yet received reports about any targeted ethnic killings. </p> <p>At about 5am I was able to get through to the president, and told him of my conversation with Machar. Kiir listened carefully to my entreaties and said that a public statement would come soon, but that he needed to control the security situation first. I urged him to make the statement now, and not wait, but he was unmoved. I tried to call Machar back, but his phones were switched off. </p> <p>...</p> <p>I learned later that fighting within the presidential guards had spread with lightning speed throughout the barracks. The noise I had heard near my residence had probably come from near the SPLA ammunition store in the New Site area, not far from the main Bilpam barracks. A firefight had occurred between loyal presidential guards and predominantly Nuer renegades. In the early morning hours the fighting had spread to nearby residential areas. Supported now by government soldiers with tanks, the security forces pushed the renegades southwards, out of New Site and surrounding neighbourhoods.</p> <p>...</p> <h2><strong>‘Attempted coup’</strong></h2> <p>The government’s version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/south-sudan-state-that-fell-apart-in-a-week\">subsequent events</a> was that at 18.30 on 15 December, during the closing of the National Liberation Council meeting, unidentified persons had fired into the air near the Nyakuron cultural centre, and escaped. This was a signal for an attack on the Giyada military barracks by soldiers of the presidential guard loyal to Machar. According to the government, these had first tried to get keys to the arms depot, failing which they attacked a group of republican guards loyal to the president to break into the armoury. In the process an officer was shot and killed. Fighting then broke out. This was followed by an attack at Bilpam and, in the early morning hours, on other SPLA posts. The attackers broke into arms depots and stole arms and uniforms at both HQ locations. To the government this confirmed planning rather than a spontaneous outburst.</p> <p>Another version of events was that President Kiir had decided to disarm Nuer members of the presidential guard, and that they had resisted. They broke into the armoury, where their weapons were stored, and fighting started. Machar’s group and others loyal to him adopted this version. They linked an increased number of Dinkas in the presidential guard to these events, all of which were part of an elaborate plan, they said, with coordinated attacks and killings in predominantly Nuer neighbourhoods. The very same new Dinka recruits, from Luri, were alleged to have had a leading role in the attacks agains the Nuer. They claimed that the “attempted coup” was just a cover for these actions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e718f877224f64e3c19a761277742410b5fc4c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e718f877224f64e3c19a761277742410b5fc4c25/0_0_2229_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hilde Johnson addresses the media in Juba January 1, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hilde F Johnson addresses the media in Juba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Akena/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another possibility was that a random shooting incident simply got out of hand and led to the escalation. Concluding his briefing, foreign minister Marial said that anyone implicated in this (ie the attacks and “attempted coup”) would be arrested. He advised diplomats to deny entry to embassy premises to all South Sudanese nationals. The government would respect the inviolability of embassies, but countries sheltering anyone suspected of a role in the attacks must inform the government of their presence. The hunt was on for Riek Machar, who remained at large. Later in the day, the US embassy, through its Twitter account, denied rumours that he had taken refuge in its compound. </p> <p>When the minister further suggested that diplomats sheltering South Sudanese civilians should advise them to go home, I wondered whether this was a tacit reference to the UN. We had been sheltering people at our bases since early morning.</p> <p>...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74a8649e114a1daa558ac5f2a0bde3e554762d9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a8649e114a1daa558ac5f2a0bde3e554762d9b/0_0_1728_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Korean soldiers provide water at a refugee camp in South Sudan on Dec. 26, 2013.

Following the first cholera cases, however, two government ministers blamed Unmiss and cited the experience of Haiti, where peacekeepers had been blamed for being the origin of the epidemic. This comparison was factually incorrect; the South Sudan outbreak began elsewhere, and our bases remained cholera free for much longer than other areas. It was also deeply unfair to all the UN staff and humanitarian partners who had worked so hard, day and night. As a response to this and a host of other challenges within our bases, new protection of civilian sites were established, allowing improvement in living conditions. As the fighting showed no signs of abating, most civilians were too afraid to return home and remained under UN protection. They were in the grip of fear. </p> <p>The US had decided to pursue targeted sanctions against individuals alleged to have been involved in atrocities and human rights abuses. The EU followed suit. The conflict had at this time, according to established definitions, reached the threshold of civil war. </p> <p>How could this happen? And how could the conflict escalate so quickly, and seemingly take on a life of its own?

Such rewrites are popular – but minor characters play an important role...","byline":"Charlotte Jones","body":"<p>Great marketing sense or mawkish sensibility? Take your pick: <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/orion-buys-pride-and-prejudice-sequel-371716\">Orion has just announced</a> a sequel to Pride and Prejudice, to be published next summer to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Jane Austen’s death. Perception by Terri Fleming will be set a few years after the events set forth in the original novel and follows Mary and Kitty, the two sisters left unmarried by Austen. That book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/mantle-acquires-other-bennet-girl-369271\">will be followed</a>, in 2018, by The Other Bennet Girl by Janice Hadlow, which similarly promises to show a hidden side to Mary. </p> <p>Austen re-imaginings are nothing new: in the last couple of years alone we’ve had Jo Baker’s Longbourn and the execrable Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, not to mention Bridget Jones’s Diary and Death Comes to Pemberley. Now it seems There’s Something About Mary, to cite another spinoff by Sebastian Di Mattia. How many books are there already out there about Mary Bennet? I must admit I stopped counting. The Forgotten Sister, The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet, Becoming Mary, Mary Bennet’s Chance, The Pursuit of Mary Bennet (subtitled “A Pride and Prejudice Novel”, which slightly wrongfooted me: isn’t Pride and Prejudice already a novel, not a franchise?) … Mary Bennett and the Bloomsbury Coven promises much excitement but anyone expecting a time-travelling sorcery mashup with Virginia Woolf and company will be disappointed.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>To recap, in case you now know more about the Mary Bennet industry than the character herself, Mary is the plain, bookish, subdued sister to Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia and Kitty. Here’s Austen pulling no punches on her pianoforte skills:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.</p> </blockquote> <p>Austen does not even grant her the intelligence or ambition that redeems the novel’s other unprepossessing spinster, Charlotte Lucas. Mary’s high (or low, depending on your point of view) moment comes at the Netherfield ball, when she takes centre stage and embarrasses the family by playing and singing appallingly badly. Mary is, then, very much the “forgotten” sister, while everyone else goes off and gets married.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mary's silent and futile presence is to me the best testament possible to the ranks of unremarkable women she stands for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This won’t, I promise, become a rant about derivative spin-offs. Re-imagining classic novels from the point of view of minor characters can produce fascinating new insights: Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, JM Coetzee’s Foe, Jane Smiley’s A Thousand Acres, Sena Jeter Naslund’s Ahab’s Wife and Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead are just a few that spring to mind. They reflect a broader cultural revisionist tendency, which seems to be accelerating, to re-inscribe the voices of the marginalised, reassert the value of “minor” figures. It’s no coincidence that, excepting Stoppard’s play, these stories are all retold from the perspective of women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"369b10a105cf73c82cbce7eb5c664827f063134c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/369b10a105cf73c82cbce7eb5c664827f063134c/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Hall as Antoinette Cosway in an adaptation of Wide Sargasso Sea, the story of the arranged marriage between a white Creole heiress and an Englishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Hall as Antoinette Cosway in an adaptation of Wide Sargasso Sea, the story of the arranged marriage between Cosway and Mr Rochester from Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Kudos Film and Television/Kudos Film and Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this interest in fleshing out the stories of minor characters – thinking about “what happens next” as though they are real people unfairly sidelined – raises an interesting point about the processes of characterisation. How do novels make us accept the differences between major and minor characters? How do authors make their heroes and heroines complex and credible while relying on a cast of supporting characters who lack interiority? It’s an asymmetry on which the realist novel, in particular, relies – what Alex Woloch calls the conundrum of “<a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7622.html\">The One v the Many</a>”.<br /></p> <p>The singularity of Elizabeth Bennett, after all – the reason she so often features in lists of our favourite literary characters – relies solely upon the relief cast by her dull sisters. Lizzie only has space in the book for a remarkable interior life because her sisters do not. Even beautiful Jane is a bit insipid – a fact Austen knowingly plays with, as her eventual engagement to Bingley is briefly threatened by Jane’s reticence.<br /></p> <p>We instinctively think of characterisation in terms of whether characters are believable, vividly imagined, likable or not. So I can understand why there’s such a slew of books seeking to reconstruct the innermost emotions, hopes and aspirations of outwardly unremarkable characters whose function just seems to be to act as props in the story of somebody else. It reminds me of a moment in Middlemarch, the English novel most concerned with such imaginative sympathy:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea – but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. […] Mr Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was spiritually a-hungered like the rest of us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dorothea’s misery in her marriage is convincing because we only see one side of it, Eliot chides us (and before you ask: no, Casaubon has not spawned a franchise of sequels). Austen isn’t Eliot, though – if she were, we might find out why Mr Collins is as paradoxically pompous and servile as he is, instead of just accepting it and chortling along. Austen does flatten and simplify many of her minor characters, because she’s ultimately most interested in her heroine. She even wrote a whole book about that kind of solipsism in Emma.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/jane-austen-feminist-pride-prejudice-curtis-sittenfeld\">Was Jane Austen a feminist? The answer is in her stories | Curtis Sittenfeld</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that’s not Austen’s broader point – her minor characters (Miss Bates, Mrs Elton, Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her anaemic daughter Anne) are equally as memorable to me as her protagonists precisely because of the distortions they undergo. They transcend their significance as individuals. The poignancy of Mary’s situation, for example, resides precisely in her effacement: neglected by her parents and unmarriageable, her silent and futile presence haunting the shadows of Pride and Prejudice is to me the best testament possible to the ranks of unremarkable women she stands for. With characters like Mary, Austen’s realism looks outwards, to subtly observe and comment on her social world, while those such as Lizzie provide a vehicle for her extraordinarily sensitive explorations of individual consciousness. It’s Austen’s uncanny ability to sustain the two perspectives that makes her one of the greatest realist novelists, and I can’t help but feel that dimension of her writing will be lost as unremarkable Mary is made, after all this time, remarkable.<br /></p>","wordcount":"1082","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-21T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qdq4","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b3f27f8e210d8ce8f0c4c0c6e5f6a6901ecd54/75_285_1646_988/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/janeausten","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Jane Austen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/janeausten","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"books/literary-criticism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Literary criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/literary-criticism","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/charlotte-jones","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Charlotte Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlotte-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/charlotte-jones","references":[],"bio":"<p>Charlotte Jones is working on a PhD study of Edwardian fiction.

So am I,” he writes. “By 20 no race-car-driving rebel, I was a guitar player on the streets of Asbury Park and already a member in good standing amongst those who ‘lie’ in service of the truth … artists, with a small ‘a’. But I held four clean aces. I had youth, almost a decade of hardcore bar band experience, a good group of homegrown musicians who were attuned to my performance style and a story to tell.”</p> <p>Springsteen writes that his book will be both “a continuation of that story and a search into its origins”. He notes that one of the questions he is asked most frequently is “How do you do it?” and that Born to Run tries to answer both how and why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"987818b639f3ab30b62f0db0258a2955f24813e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987818b639f3ab30b62f0db0258a2955f24813e3/0_191_1824_2374/768.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography, Born to Run\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography, Born to Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon and Schuster UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also lists some of the qualities he suggests will come in handy should you find yourself playing in front of “80,000 (or 80) screaming rock’n’roll fans”, those being: “DNA, natural ability, study of craft, development of and devotion to an aesthetic philosophy, naked desire for … fame? … love? … admiration? … attention? … women? … sex? … and oh, yeah … a buck. Then … if you want to take it all the way out to the end of the night, a furious fire in the hole that just … don’t … quit … burning.”</p> <p>Born to Run, due to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 27 September, is one of the most anticipated rock memoirs in years. He has been writing the book since 2009. “Writing about yourself is a funny business,” <a href=\"http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2016/springsteens-autobiography\">Springsteen said</a>. “But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.”</p> <p>“If you were to ask any publisher to name a cultural figure whose autobiography would provoke the greatest enthusiasm, Bruce Springsteen’s name would be on every list,” said Ian Chapman, CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster UK, when the book was announced in February. “Beyond being one of the most admired individuals in the world, he is a captivating storyteller with a unique way of expressing himself.”</p> <p>The book will be accompanied by a compilation album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/pre-fame-bruce-springsteen-tracks-to-feature-on-audio-companion-to-his-autobiography\">Chapter and Verse</a>, to be released on 23 September, and

songs.</p>","wordcount":"412","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-20T07:45:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v6an","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d3da0ab583575bbebdfb9e4743c941866de2be/0_60_5616_3370/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"music/springsteen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Bruce

Phillips","body":"<p>PopCo: it’s an awkward novel to read and it’s about awkward things. It could be read as a manual for how to be a difficult individual when all the pressure around you is to conform. It’s an anti-corporate story about making toys, an anti-hipster book about having dirty sex and vegan cake. It is very pro-sabotage. Really, what Scarlett Thomas’s novel is is a tonic for anyone who feels like every job turns you into a cog in a machine.</p> <p>Under cover of what seems a light read – woman works at a toy company devising new toys for teenage girls – Thomas unravels a dense story of an underground society of rebels. Working at PopCo, our heroine Alice Butler meets a mysterious cast of fellow toymakers, while recalling adventures with her grandparents – a cryptologist and a mathematician. It’s inspiring to think that beneath the plain exterior of your fellow office workers lurks a band of anarchist revolutionaries. Even more exciting to think that the real agents of change around us aren’t the advertisers and the demagogues, but the people who love patterns in words and numbers. If there is hope here, it lies in crosswords and secret scribbled cipher notes.</p> <p>We know we have to work for a living, but we also know office work crushes a revolutionary spirit. You could join your union, but you’re likely not sure if trade unions and labour activism are appropriate for office work. But in PopCo, Alice and her friends are guides to rebellion from the inside, offering tantalising ideas like bad advertising and bad customer service being a surreptitious strategy to show the cracks in the sheen of 21st-century capitalism.</p> <p>It’s a love letter to the individuals who reject being part of a crowd, even when the masses claim to be doing something radical or different. In one key moment, Alice’s radical guide Esther rejects the idea of being at a modern music festival:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you’re in the crowd, you’re a dot, a nothing, a statistic. I don’t want to be in the crowd. I’m not an insect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Esther doesn’t want to be in the audience, but nor does she want to be in the band selling itself to the audience. She wants to be left to do something that feels authentic, and of her own choice. Alice has her own rejection of trendy mass culture, through coding and decoding messages that only one person can read. This story isn’t only a blueprint for destroying a corporation, it’s also one for escaping the crowd and having hope in your own individuality and awkwardness.</p> <p>It sounds preposterous and that’s the joy of it. I love reading the book for its audaciousness, for using popular fiction to stir jaded idealists. I’m filled with hope that a modern novelist can be published who pays detailed attention to characters’ fashion senses and haircuts one moment, writes great sex scenes the next, and then suddenly proceeds to devote pages to why its central character is turning vegan – all the while providing graphic detail about the evil of the dairy industry. This isn’t stodgy activism, it feels like a new blueprint for revolution: miso soup and lipgloss, rather than bread and roses.</p> <p>PopCo is idealistic, easy to patronise, naive and unashamedly political. It crams in many more ideas than novel-writing courses would say was appropriate. But if you don’t like that, you’re missing out. The book suggests that at any moment in your daily working routine, you might notice the magic and revolution in your workmates that changes your life and vindicates you. That’s enough to give you some hope in your nine-to-five.<br /></p>","wordcount":"626","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-20T07:00:25Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pcy2","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/afd5458edd9934e6432646a62d9d53d9bb258f50/855_642_1145_687/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/books-to-give-you-hope","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books to give you hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/books-to-give-you-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/books-to-give-you-hope","references":[],"description":"<p>During a summer of bleak news stories, Guardian writers recommend favourite books that offer the reader a bright side</p>"},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/charlie-phillips","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Charlie Phillips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlie-phillips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/charlie-phillips","references":[],"bio":"<p>Charlie Phillips is Head of Documentaries at The Guardian.</p><p><a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1442849447365/Charlie-Phillips.pub.txt\">Click here for Charlie Phillip's public key.</a></p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426787679742/Charlie-Phillips.jpg","firstName":"charlie","lastName":"phillips"}],"elements":[{"id":"afd5458edd9934e6432646a62d9d53d9bb258f50","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/afd5458edd9934e6432646a62d9d53d9bb258f50/855_642_1145_687/1000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"detail from the wall of an art gallery in Hong Kong, covered with about 16,000 toys made in China, in an exhibition by German photographer Michael Wolf.

When it comes to looking after kids, be a gardener not a carpenter","byline":"Bee Wilson","body":"<p>In 2011, a team of psychologists did an experiment with some preschool children. The scientists gave the children a toy made of many plastic tubes, each with a different function: one squeaked, one lit up, one made music and the final tube had a hidden mirror. With half the children, an experimenter came into the room and bumped – apparently accidentally – into the tube that squeaked. “Oops!” she said. With the other children, the scientist acted more deliberately, like a teacher. “Oh look at my neat toy! Let me show you how it works,” she said while purposely pressing the beeper. The children were then left alone to play with the toy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/jan/26/parents.familyandrelationships\">Tears, tantrums and other experiments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the “accidental” group, the children freely played with the toy in various random ways. Through experimenting, they discovered all the different functions of the tubes: the light, the music, the mirror. The other group, the children who had been deliberately taught how to use the toy by the teacher, played with it in a much more limited and repetitive way. They squeaked the beeper over and over again, never discovering all the other things the toy could do.</p> <p>For the US developmental psychologist <a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com/\" title=\"\">Alison Gopnik</a>, this experiment reveals some of the deep flaws in modern parenting. Parents try – heaven knows, we try – to help our children win at a succession of tasks in life, from Duplo towers to GCSEs. But in the process, Gopnik argues, we may end up limiting the very potential we are trying to foster. She excoriates the parents “who want to shape their three-year-olds into Harvard freshmen”. On Gopnik’s reading, children flourish the most – like the preschoolers in the accidental group – when they are left free to explore. They also learn as much from our mistakes as they do from our instructions. “Our job is not to shape our children’s minds; it’s to let those minds explore all the possibilities that the world allows.”</p> <p>Gopnik’s central argument in this fascinating and passionate diatribe is that modern, affluent societies approach child-rearing in a wrongheaded way. Middle-class families feel under immense pressure to parent our children in such a way that they will turn out right. We speak of good and bad parenting. We shuttle them to football practice and ballet lessons; and later, push them to complete their Duke of Edinburgh awards. We anxiously scrutinise their book bags each night, or feel guilty that we are failing to do so. We worry whether they are getting enough sleep, making enough friends. There’s a tendency to endlessly query our own choices. Are we working too much or too little? Are we protecting them too much or not enough?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To be a wife is not to engage in 'wifing', so why do we imagine that we can – or should – parent a child?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Gopnik, these are simply the wrong questions, because we should not think of looking after children as “parenting” at all. The trouble with parenting, on her reading, is that it treats looking after children as a form of work rather than a form of love. And by treating childcare as work, parents are doomed to feel dissatisfied, because it’s a relentless, thankless, messy, unpaid occupation. But, Gopnik adds, it’s “a pretty great kind of love, at least for most of us”.</p> <p>The parenting model assumes that parents are always active and children are always passive, but Gopnik would like us to think of it as an interplay, like dancing, or like the other important relationships in our lives. “To be a wife is not to engage in ‘wifing’, to be a friend is not to ‘friend’, even on Facebook, and we don’t ‘child’ our mothers and fathers. Yet these relationships are central to who we are.” So why do we imagine that we can – or should – parent a child?</p> <p>The book’s title, <em>The Gardener and the Carpenter</em>, comes from a metaphor about the parent-child relationship. To seek to parent a child, Gopnik argues, is to behave like a carpenter, chiselling away at something to achieve a particular end-goal – in this case, a certain kind of person. A carpenter believes that he or she has the power to transform a block of wood into a chair. When we garden, on the other hand, we do not believe we are the ones who single-handedly create the cabbages or the roses. Rather, we toil to create the conditions in which plants have the best chance of flourishing. The gardener knows that plans will often be thwarted, Gopnik writes. “The poppy comes up neon orange instead of pale pink … black spot and rust and aphids can never be defeated.” If parents are like gardeners, the aim is to create a protected space in which our children can become themselves, rather than trying to mould them.</p> <p>The parenting model, Gopnik argues, has been a spectacular failure. The US, where billions of dollars are spent on parenting books, “also has the highest rates of infant mortality and child poverty in the developing world”. In both the US and the UK, the education system has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/20/primary-school-review\" title=\"\">ever more focused on “outcomes”</a>, in the form of test scores, and yet rates of illiteracy, particularly among lower income children, remain high. Moreover, children who “don’t fit the demands of school are treated as if they were ill or defective or disabled”. Instead of obsessing about test scores, Gopnik suggests that we should as a society care for children more – particularly poor ones. She cites early years interventions: children who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/02/nurseries-childcare-pre-school-cortisol\" title=\"\">access to high quality nurseries</a> or whose parents are given home-visit support “grow up to be healthier and have higher incomes”.</p> <p>Gopnik also insists that the narrow parenting model is based on bad science. In evolutionary terms, the human race benefits from nurturing children with a wide range of characteristics. Compared with other species, we have “a much longer immaturity, a much larger relative brain size, and a much greater ability to learn”. Because human babies stay needy for so long, they were often, in our evolutionary past, cared for by multiple members of a community. Gopnik draws on numerous studies to show that children learn best by listening to and observing many different people. We acquire skills by playing and, later, by apprenticeship. It is therefore crazy, she suggests, to create a school system in which play is progressively stifled and in which children are taught science not by doing it but by reading about it and filling in quizzes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our job isn't to shape our children’s minds; it’s to let those minds explore all the possibilities that the world allows</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gopnik is not the first to have argued for a less instrumental and more playful view of childhood, but her book is still a welcome corrective to the results-driven approach to parenting. Her book makes a fine companion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/23/review-far-from-the-tree\" title=\"\"><em>Far from the Tree</em> by Andrew Solomon</a>, although she writes with less poetry than Solomon and, for my taste, goes on one digression too many about the wonders of her own grandchildren (“When Augie or Georgie are in the room it’s hard for me to see anybody else”). Augie, her grandson, is “a proven chick magnet” and loves books so much he reads them on the potty. Aged one, he charms the man at the farmers’ market into giving him a cherry and hazelnut biscotti. He tries to imitate his grandfather by using a wooden spoon to dig up mouthfuls of vegan, organic sorbet.</p> <p>To Gopnik, Augie’s sorbet-eating skills are yet more proof that human children are “remarkably effective social learners”, when given the freedom. True, but we could also parse the scene in another way. The problems with how children are raised today cannot all be reduced to parenting. There is also the sheer injustice of a world where some children have biscotti and books and loving grandparents to buy them; and others have none.• To order The Gardener and the Carpenter for £12.29 (RRP £18.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gardener-and-the-carpenter.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","byline":"Ben Myers","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/455m8"},"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jamesbaldwin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Baldwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamesbaldwin","references":[]},{"id":"books/franzkafka","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Franz Kafka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/franzkafka","references":[]},{"id":"books/fyodordostoevsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benmyers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Myers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benmyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benmyers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Myers is an author and journalist.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","byline":"Michelle Dean","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","wordcount":"3166","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/45xtn"},"tags":[{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/ohio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Ohio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/ohio","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michelle-dean","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michelle Dean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michelle-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michelle-dean","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michelle Dean is a critic and journalist based in New York</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Columnist/Head_shots/2014/11/19/1416432311450/Michelle-Dean-003.jpg","firstName":"michelle","lastName":"dean"}],"elements":[{"id":"cb6b20b56055d09e0be1ccc10c273e0536d24694","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608386967/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"altText":"Malarkey family","caption":"In a photo from January 2009, Beth Malarkey covers up her son, Alex, after surgery as Alex’s father, Kevin, watches.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it?

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

Castle","byline":"Maev Kennedy","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"439","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44pzh"},"tags":[{"id":"culture/heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[],"bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142224016/Maev-Kennedy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142245982/Maev-Kennedy-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kennedy"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","wordcount":"1024","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44ev3"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum selects the definitive 100 novels written in English"},{"id":"books/malcolm-lowry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Malcolm Lowry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malcolm-lowry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/malcolm-lowry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Murder, intrigue and a beguiling protagonist make <strong>Adam LeBor</strong>’s international thriller <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062330017/the-washington-stratagem\"><strong>The Washington Stratagem</strong></a> a gripping and enticing read.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Edpilkington\">@Edpilkington</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I’m both addicted to and critical of mystery novels. You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign. From the first sentence, Gay presents the reader with the one of the most visceral and haunting depictions of trauma on the female body and spirit.</p> <p><em><strong>Sarah Galo, open intern (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahEvonne\">@SarahEvonne</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/shining-girls-lauren-beukes-review\"><strong>Lauren Beukes’s The Shining Girls</strong></a> taught me how to love the suspense novel with its precise and powerful tale of a time-traveling serial killer and the rough, young female out to stop him. Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country. Accessible without conceding authority, hugely detailed without surrendering clarity or literary flair. A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

again","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut

When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains.

gap between what was said and what was done","byline":"Richard Coles","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","wordcount":"514","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448tj"},"tags":[{"id":"books/pdjames","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"PD
