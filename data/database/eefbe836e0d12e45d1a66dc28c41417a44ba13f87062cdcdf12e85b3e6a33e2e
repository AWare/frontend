He declared it must be settled this week for the good of the party.</strong></li> <li><strong>Combet suggested that Labor could not go into election indulging a public civil war, so it was up to Kevin Rudd to make his move.</strong></li> <li><strong>Labor backbencher Stephen Jones agreed with Combet. He thought there should be a leadership ballot this week.</strong></li> <li><strong>The result of all that is tonight is a continuing stand-off. Will Rudd challenge, or will he not - and in the meantime can we all focus on something else (say the poor old readers, sick to death of the soap opera)?</strong></li> <li><strong>Parliament celebrated its 25th anniversary as a building. Everyone made lovely reflections on Parliament House growing elegantly and iteratively into its contours and its history. Those of us lucky enough to work here reflected on that privilege.</strong></li> <li><strong>A bunch of MPs made their farewells.</strong></li> <li><strong>The line of the day went to Labor's Harry Jenkins who compared Mark Latham to Lord Voldermort, before arguing even Lord Voldermort had his good points.</strong></li> <li><strong>Liberal Barry Haase was more colourful, reflecting on his inability to call a fairy penguin a fairy penguin due to the scourge of the thought police, who were lurking .. somewhere.</strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition turned Question Time into a leader-versary. There were a series of questions to Julia Gilard about broken promises and competence and what on earth are you still doing here?</strong></li> <li><strong>Former Blair spin doctor Alister Campbell made a courtesy call on the prime minister, and reflected on social media that it would all be so good for Labor if things weren't so bad.</strong></li> <li><strong>The House of Representatives made like a law-making chamber, and continued consideration of the government's crackdown on the use of 457 visas.</strong></li> <li><strong>That consideration was continuing.</strong></li> </ul> <p>That enough?</p> <p>I reckon it is for tonight.</p> <p>Bless Mike Bowers and Mary and Madhvi in Sydney.

That&rsquo;s what the people expect us to do and that&rsquo;s what we will do, should we have the honour of forming a government after the 14th of September.</p> <p>I just want to say that things can be so much better than this. The Australian people know in their hearts that things can be so much better than this. I am confident that, should we form a government, within quite a short space of time people will look back on these days and they will say it was a bad dream that has passed in the night, because our best days as a country are ahead of us; they are ahead of us if we have a government which reflects the strengths, the aspirations and the decencies of the Australian people.</p> <p>Finally, let me just say how proud I am of all of you. I know that all of you will make outstanding ministers in a government, should we get to form a government after the 14th of September.</p> <p>I could not have asked for stronger support, for better counsel and for deeper friendship than I have had from my colleagues around this table. I think the Australian people can be confident that around this table are people in whose hands they can trust the future of our country.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-082e53f7-19bf-4110-8796-6c151715f767\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/24/1372034209737/5c8be86d-c570-442b-b954-7c76941c5f86-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott addresses shadow cabinet.

The absolute basic of starting to restore Labor&rsquo;s political position is to not have this type of speculation. So, I think a few things are clear: one is that the Prime Minister is not about to step down. Two is, senior Cabinet colleagues are not about to ask her to step down. And three is, I think Kevin Rudd does need to decide what he is going to do here. But we cannot come out of this final week of Parliament with this speculation continuing all the way to the election.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>So the worst outcome this week would be the leadership remains untested?</p> <p><strong>GREG COMBET: </strong>It has just got to be resolved.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>Is the only way to resolve it to test it?</p> <p><strong>GREG COMBET: </strong>Well, I think Kevin Rudd has to decide whether he is a candidate or not, and then do something about it, if he wants to do something about it. The preconditions that have been articulated through the media over the last couple of weeks for that to happen are not going to occur.

I&rsquo;ve also included a link to an editorial from The Age newspaper over the weekend calling on the Prime Minister to step aside.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m interested in reader&rsquo;s views on that intervention.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Rudd: time to put up or shut up</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/yet-another-bad-poll-for-gillard-if-anyone-in-labor-is-listening-15451\">Despite the consistently bad polls, Kevin Rudd appears to be cornered, as memories flood back of that night, three years ago today, when Julia Gillard and her supporters knifed him. Unless something unforeseen happens and assuming Gillard holds her nerve, if Rudd wants to reclaim the prize that was snatched away the onus will be on him to try to grab it. The leadership is not going to be handed to him in some consensus fashion. Either Rudd decides to front up and challenge or before week&rsquo;s end, he concludes the numbers are not there and backs off, claiming he was never trying in the first place.</a> (The Conversation)</p> <p><strong>Poll wipeout for Labor</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbott-widens-gap-as-preferred-pm-over-julia-gillard-in-latest-newspoll/story-fn59niix-1226668507117\">Tony Abbott has opened his biggest lead ever over Julia Gillard as preferred prime minister as Labor's primary vote fell below 30 per cent for the first time in a year. With parliament entering its final sitting week before the election, the Opposition Leader now leads the Prime Minister by 12 percentage points after trailing by 30 points as the preferred prime minister when Ms Gillard became leader in June 2010. Facing increasing pressure to step down as Labor leader in favour of Kevin Rudd by the end of the week, Ms Gillard's support as preferred prime minister dropped from 35 to 33 in the latest Newspoll survey, conducted exclusively for The Australian on the weekend. The pressure is continuing to mount on Ms Gillard, with Rudd backers maintaining the Prime Minister has lost the confidence of caucus and the leadership crisis will be decided late this week.</a> (The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/alp-mps-kept-in-dark-on-disastrous-labor-poll-which-predicts-election-wipeout/story-fni0cx12-1226668469923\">An internal ALP report containing polling for 40 seats across Australia, and circulated among selected members of Julia Gillard's leadership group, shows Labor would be lucky to retain 30 to 35 seats after the election.

Ms Gillard should do so in the interests of the Labor Party, in the interests of the nation and, most importantly, in the interests of democracy. The Age's overriding concern is that, under Ms Gillard's leadership, the Labor Party's message about its future policies and vision for Australia is not getting through to the electorate. </a>(The Age, Editorial)</p> <p><strong>Australia&rsquo;s 40th casualty in Afghanistan</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/commando-leader-becomes-the-40th-digger-to-fall/story-e6frg8yo-1226668502678\">Fighting in Afghanistan continues to take a grim toll on the bravest of Australia's soldiers with another decorated Digger killed in a shootout with insurgents.

Today Mr McTernan is up there again, not on the cover of a best-selling magazine but highly visible in the background to its creation.</p> <p>It was Mr McTernan who about two months ago pushed the idea of Prime Minister as domestic goddess, posing with dog and knitting wool. It was at a meeting of senior Labor figures seeking a strategy to soften of Ms Gillard's image.</p> <p>There was disagreement over the plan, but Mr McTernan persisted. The AWW has confirmed he suggested the pose.</p> <p>It must be said that - within the style of the<em> Australian Women's Weekly </em>- the cover photo is a reasonable representation. Julia Gillard does knit and occasionally would have a pooch at her feet.</p> <p>If for some reason she appeared on the cover of <em>Cars and Mechanics </em>Ms Gillard would be depicted in overalls installed carbies. So to see her on the front of<em> The Australian Women's Weekly</em> seamlessly knitting wasn't a huge shock.</p> <p>The so-called outrage over the <em>AWW</em> edition has been pretty strained.</p> <p>But the harm to the Prime Minister from this episode comes in the form of the renewed focus on Mr McTernan's role, and the unpopularity he is generating within the Government.</p> <p>The best political and communications advisers to Prime Ministers are neither seen nor heard by the public, not if they want to be effective.</p> <p>Mr McTernan is beginning to compete with his employer for prominence, and he seems to be doing as good a job presenting a positive image of himself as he is of her.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c8f0efe4b02652aa7a7ae1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-25T02:22:55.689+01:00\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor senator Mark Bishop expands on that question Foreign Minister Carr faced, and his answer this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/senatormbishop/statuses/349334936278409218\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Carr to caucus boat people spike driven by economic issues, not events in Asia.

It&rsquo;s obviously also hurt our farmers and hit profitability in mining. So it&rsquo;s good to see the Australian dollar depreciating, as it should as our terms of trade weaken and as the US begins the very long journey back to normal monetary policy settings. This should make the transition towards non-mining sources of growth a bit easier, although even at current levels it is still putting a handbrake on activity in some sectors.</p> <p>But we can also acknowledge that the higher dollar has increased the real incomes of Australians and helped keep inflation contained, helping the RBA to take interest rates down to record low levels. With a cheap currency, I doubt we could have got through such a big investment boom without high inflation and higher interest rates. Instead, we&rsquo;ve been able to successfully manage the investment boom without feeling a lot of the pressures we experienced in earlier commodity price booms such as the early 70s and 80s.</p> <p>So as we begin this new period of transition, we should take confidence in the fact that we&rsquo;ve already come through some extraordinary economic events in very good shape.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c8e5e7e4b09f68a7c51efa\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-25T01:35:51.663+01:00\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I knit, therefore I am.</p> <p>(Actually I don't knit.

A quarterly analysis of Newspoll surveys also reveals that Mr Abbott is almost as popular among female voters as the nation's preferred prime minister, coming within four percentage points of Ms Gillard, the closest for two years.</a> (The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/election_rout_to_halve_labor_seats_xgkuqPBzxQJNKti4uEmcJN\">Labor is on track to lose up to 35 of its 71&thinsp;seats at the federal election, including nine held by ministers, according to an exclusive new poll of the party&rsquo;s most vulnerable electorates. The poll of the 47&thinsp;Labor seats held by a margin of 12&thinsp;per cent or less shows there has been a nationwide 7.6&thinsp;per cent two-party-preferred swing against the ALP in these seats since the August 2010 election.

The conversation, in which Mr Combet was reported to have expressed frustration at Prime Minister Julia Gillard's handling of the carbon tax debate, is said to have taken place in Mr Rudd's office at the end of 2011, just months before the first challenge to Ms Gillard's leadership.</a> (The Daily Telegraph)</p> <p><strong>But Rudd&rsquo;s gotta zip for Beijing</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/kevin-rudds-china-trip-may-bring-on-showdown/story-fn59niix-1226669020834\">Kevin Rudd has booked an international flight to China on Thursday afternoon to speak at a conference in Beijing on Friday in a move that could bring forward the deadline to resolve Labor's leadership crisis before parliament rises.</a> (The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><strong>Julia Gillard knits kangaroo and gets interviewed by top selling women&rsquo;s mag</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/some-yarn-julia-gillard-knits-a-royal-roo/story-fn59niix-1226669067651\">She is both a republican and a trail-blazing feminist, but Julia Gillard has chosen to portray \"a different\" side of herself to the electorate, revealing she is knitting a toy kangaroo for the royal baby, due next month.

The man, Freddy Ambon, is one of Indonesia's most active people smugglers, and boasts of sending multiple boats per month to Christmas Island, charging refugees between $5000 and $6000 for the journey. He also talks about a boat he helped arrange last year which sank, killing 96 people.

How hard was it for you to vote against Australia&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister? Here you are, a senior woman in a Labor Cabinet.</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>And a feminist. And that&rsquo;s been extremely hard. But, ultimately, as I said, you have to weigh your loyalties and your different principles. And I do not believe the feminist principles which I hold dear would be served by Tony Abbott becoming Prime Minister with the views that he has expressed on women and women&rsquo;s capacity and because of the ways in which he has implicitly allowed the sexism in this country that we have seen on display. I do not believe a leopard changes his spots.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>In terms of the sexism which has been on display, as you say, the Prime Minister made some reference to that last night too &ndash; the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in her speech after the vote. She said: &ldquo;The reaction to being the first woman Prime Minister does not explain everything about my Prime Ministership, nor does it explain nothing. It explains some things and it&rsquo;s for the nation to think about those things in a sophisticated way&rdquo;. Do you think the reaction to having a female Prime Minister ... how much of it does explain about Julia Gillard&rsquo;s position in the polls with the electorate?</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>I think Julia put it very well &ndash; &ldquo;it explains some things, but not everything&rdquo;. And I think her suggestion that we collectively consider as a nation the response and, in particular, the way in which things were said, the sorts of views and personal attacks that became legitimised, we should think about whether that is what we want for our national politics. As Prime Minister Rudd said last night, that is not what we want for our national politics. We should have a very different approach to our political life and I hope that we do consider that.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>Julia Gillard also said last night that she thinks her doing this job will make it easier for the next woman. You could argue it could make it harder, given the reaction?</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>Well, it depends what we do with it. I think she&rsquo;s right. The important thing about being the first is that there&rsquo;s another, and then another.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cb8b53e4b09948c1bd8728\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T01:46:11.666+01:00\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There's fifty of his closest friends waiting outside the ABC studios in parliament house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/statuses/350049594442383360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Don&#39;t dream it&#39;s over.

Is that the case this morning?</p> <p><strong>TONY ABBOTT: </strong>Look, plainly one-third of the Cabinet has no confidence in Mr Rudd. They have resigned. It&rsquo;s the biggest exodus from the Cabinet in memory. <strong>But we are not into parliamentary games. There have been far too many parliamentary games, there&rsquo;s been far too much backroom dealing and double crossing. Let's let the people decide. That&rsquo;s what we need.</strong></p> <p><strong>KARL STEFANOVIC: </strong>You&rsquo;ve talked about that, though, in the past. You&rsquo;ve obviously changed your mind on that. Why have you have changed your mind on the no confidence motion?</p> <p><strong>TONY ABBOTT: </strong>Well, I&rsquo;ve always said it&rsquo;s the people's responsibility to choose the Prime Minister and to choose the government. All we have had for the last three years are backroom deals and back-stabbing orchestrated by the faceless men who are not interested in the welfare of the Australian people, not interested in the all the battlers out there who are struggling with the cost of living pressures, who wonder why our borders are in chaos.

Our two protagonists met up after some punditry on morning TV.</p> <p>I won&rsquo;t bombard you all with an exhaustive list of stories about the leadership in our news wrap this morning - I&rsquo;m going to assume, given the readership yesterday, that you are across what happened, more or less.</p> <p>But I will point you in the direction of a few pieces by my favourite writers on a completely extraordinary day.</p> <p><strong>Michael Gordon: The Age</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/gillard-pays-ultimate-price-to-end-a-poisonous-chapter-20130626-2oxm9.html\">Julia Gillard has delivered the ultimate act of leadership and paid the ultimate price, ending the most poisonous, inglorious chapter in modern Labor Party history. But whether Kevin Rudd transforms Labor's prospects at the election depends on whether he can re-unite a fractured party that he helped divide, re-connect with a hostile electorate and challenge a rampant opposition. Gillard's magnanimity in the end has made the transition easier; her decisiveness ensured that this was the last stand. Yes, her flaws made her vulnerable, but she will be remembered as one of the nation's most tenacious leaders.</a></p> <p><strong>Paul Kelly: The Australian (paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/rudd-must-keep-labor-ship-afloat/story-e6frg74x-1226670497176\">Kevin Rudd is resurrected, Julia Gillard's career is destroyed and Rudd has launched a new crusade to halt the Tony Abbott bandwagon. This is the dramatic trifecta that pivots the 2013 election upon an unpredictable new axis. In grim desperation the Labor Party has voted for its self-survival in a bid to deny or cripple an Abbott government.</a></p> <p><strong>Lenore Taylor: Guardian Australia</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/labor-leadership-spill-kevin-rudd\">The future of the party now hinges on whether voters still like Rudd when he is leader again, or whether their professed preference for him was really a hankering for the way they felt when they elected him as \"Kevin07\", and politics still felt hopeful and positive &ndash; in contrast to the down and dirty shouting match it has been for the past three years.</a></p> <p><strong>Laura Tingle: The Australian Financial Review (paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/huge_task_for_recycled_leader_6M7qhKMZTIW2tgpkTjUM3M\">Kevin Rudd finally returns to a prime ministership diminished by the Labor civil war that first removed him, helped create minority government and then replaced him. And in which he, of course, was a major protagonist. His will to power, and all the flaws it has exposed along the way, now turn on Tony Abbott. His goal will be an election victory &ndash; not saving the furniture &ndash; though the timing of that election must now be in doubt.</a></p> <p><strong>Michelle Grattan: The Conversation</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/rudd-wins-the-game-of-thrones-15573\">Rudd has been restored to the leadership three years to the week after he was pushed out. </a><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/rudd-wins-the-game-of-thrones-15573\">In his mind, his return journey has all been about righting a wrong, seizing back what was his &ndash; the power, the Prime Ministerial Office, the Lodge.

Recent Australian political history also suggests that when it ends badly for Labor female leaders, it ends really badly. Female Labor leaders aren't just defeated, it's almost as if the electorate goes after them with a special kind of vengeance, in ways that conventional media polls just don't pick up in the vote intention questions. I'm recalling the spectacular losses for female Labor state premiers such as Joan Kirner (Victoria), Kristina Kenneally (New South Wales), and Anna Bligh (Queensland).</p> <p>I don't doubt there is a gender gap out there right now. I doubt it is as big as 10 points, but something in the three- to seven-point range wouldn't surprise me.</p> <p>Again, keep in mind that the last serious academic study of the electorate after the 2010 election found a seven-point gap. Let's see what the next round of polling brings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But don't lose sight of the main issue for the ALP.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the meantime, bear this in mind: Labor's problem is not so much the gender gap as much as it is the fact that it is polling in the low to mid-30s, even among women.</p> <p>We wouldn't be talking as much about the gender gap if there were an extra 10-12 points of Labor vote share in these poll results.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51bff185e4b0eaff1e64698a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-18T06:35:01.870+01:00\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Abbott is doing the full stump speech in the MPI this afternoon.</p> <p>He makes a reference about making a transition from tribal fighter to a leader capable of uniting the country.

And it is based on a simple premise &ndash; that members of the parliamentary executive must be free to offer frank and fearless advice in the decision making process if that executive is to function effectively.</p> <p>This is much more likely to happen if individual members of the executive owe their positions to the full parliamentary caucus as a collective, rather than to just one individual. I believe we started heading in the wrong direction when we changed rule 38 &ndash; and this caucus must bear some of the responsibility for that. Of the 102 current members of this caucus, 88 participated in the decision to change rule 38 in that post-election euphoria of 2008.</p> <p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s appropriate that this caucus takes the necessary steps to correct that mistake. Some have argued that the change was designed to modernise our party&rsquo;s rules and bring the party into the 21st century.</p> <p>It actually took us backwards &ndash; not forwards.</p> <p>If granting the leader the power and authority to choose the front bench team was such a positive move why hasn&rsquo;t our state parliamentary parties followed suit and adopted the same procedures?</p> <p>There is also a view that a return to the original method would (heaven forbid) empower factions to conduct meetings in back rooms to determine the makeup of the front bench.</p> <p>Factions, or more particular the self-appointed factional power brokers, can only dominate the process if the Caucus allows them to.</p> <p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p> <p>Caucus must retain the ability to be in charge of its own destiny.</p> <p>We have a free vote for leadership positions, why can&rsquo;t there be a free vote for all executive positions free of the self-interest of the leader and those who fancy themselves as so called power brokers in caucus?</p> <p>The answer is &ndash; there can be &ndash; if the caucus collectively has the courage to allow it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>* Note to readers: This blog post is amended from the original, which indicated the speech was posted by Gibbons, but not delivered in caucus.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-18T03:03:28.844+01:00\">at 12.03pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51bfaef9e4b02dc3b3d6ea4b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-18T01:51:06.656+01:00\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I'm well aware that journalists and politicians aren't held in high esteem at this point in time.</p> <p>But a quick plug for one of our main charity outings of the year.</p> <p>Readers of politics live may be interested to make a bid on one of the items up for auction at the Mid Winter Ball which will be held in parliament house tomorrow night.</p> <p>All proceeds to a bunch of worthy causes.</p> <p>Up for grabs - according to the blurbs -</p> <ul> <li>A unique chance for four people to dine with the Prime Minister of Australia The Hon Julia Gillard at her official Canberra home, The Lodge or her iconic Sydney residence Kirribilli House.</li> <li>A hand knitted scarf knitted by the Prime Minister Julia Gillard.</li> <li>Join the Prime Minister of Australia, at the PM's XI vs England cricket match.

Unsurprisingly, this motion is now being analysed on the basis of whether it's meaningul for Julia Gillard's leadership.</p> <p>I gave Gibbons a quick call to check. As far as he's concerned, he's pressing ahead with this motion. He has a seconder for it, NSW MP Daryl Melham.

MPs aligned to Kevin Rudd are likely to force the issue today in an attempt to further weaken her position. A motion to return the powers first given to Mr Rudd in 2008 back to the caucus is on the notice paper for today's meeting - the last session Ms Gillard will attend before the September 14 poll. However, senior MPs backing the Prime Minister claim they will seek to defer the vote until after the election. It is believed a deal has been sealed to delay the vote.</a> (The Daily Telegraph)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/kevin-rudd-in-front-but-no-putsch/story-fn59niix-1226665310655\">Kevin Rudd's supporters have declared that, for the first time since he was deposed as prime minister three years ago, he has the numbers in Labor caucus to topple Julia Gillard as leader, but they claim there will still be no leadership change until there is overwhelming support within the party for the former prime minister. The stalemate is increasing pressure on senior ministers to act decisively and provide leadership to nervous caucus members, who will gather for a crucial meeting in Canberra this morning. </a>(The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/peter-beattie-says-bob-hawke-should-mediate-in-the-federal-leadership-dispute/story-fnihsrf2-1226665281441\">Bob Hawke should be drafted to mediate in the Labor leadership dispute, according to former Queensland premier Peter Beattie.

With Ms Gillard and her senior &shy;supporters defiantly ruling out any prospect of her stepping aside, Mr Rudd&rsquo;s backers say even if the numbers swing overwhelmingly behind him, and a delegation visits the Prime &shy;Minister, she is still likely to force a vote. </a>(The Australian Financial Review, paywalled)</p> <p><strong>NBN Co</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/technology/hunt_begins_for_coalition_nbn_chief_6o2xGykjQmmLAjAjPqnhaP\">The Coalition is zeroing in on its preferred candidates to replace NBN Co chief executive Mike Quigley and other senior execs if it wins power.

Good to see so many of you firing up on the comments on the blog; and others keeping in touch on Twitter.</p> <p>As no-one has said anything foolish that I know about for some period of time, let's do the evening summary.</p> <p><strong>Today in federal politics:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>The day opened with another poor opinion poll for the ALP and for Julia Gillard, with the primary vote dipping below 30 per cent.</strong></li> <li><strong>It was a better poll for Kevin Rudd - as it showed he was more popular than the Prime Minister, and could get Labor back within striking distance in September.</strong></li> <li><strong>Pollster John Stirton however warned this represented a \"magical scenario\" where there was a leadership change with no side-effects and no consequences.</strong></li> <li><strong>The same poll showed voters liked former Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull more than Tony Abbott - perhaps confirming a distinct pox on all your leaders mood in the community - although of course the data showed the Coalition would win any election held today by a considerable margin.</strong></li> <li><strong>Leadership speculation trickled through the political day.</strong></li> <li><strong>The government continued to press for more states to sign on to the Gonski education reforms.</strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition was mostly concerned with cost of living and the carbon tax in Question Time.</strong></li> <li><strong>Liberal backbencher Judi Moylan began the valedictories of this session with a classy farewell speech which articulated the values of her lengthy political career.</strong></li> <li><strong>The cross benchers reflected on their experience of the minority parliament in interviews with Guardian Australia - and a few of them: Bob Katter, Nick Xenophon and Andrew Wilkie, also flexed a bit of rhetorical muscle on the subject of the excessive market power of supermarkets.</strong></li> <li><strong>With parliament entering its final two weeks, the government more or less confirmed this afternoon that it would drop the final element of its battered and broken media package - its plan to scrap the reach rule (which is relevant for TV mergers being proposed at the present time.)</strong></li> </ul> <p>Thanks muchly to Mike Bowers and the Sydney team, particularly Madhvi Pankhania and Mary Hamilton, and also Christian Bennett. Have a lovely evening. See you tomorrow.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51bebc36e4b0981d79e0f949\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T08:35:19.172+01:00\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We are heading towards our close this evening, but for those of you who like to keep close track of parliamentary proceedings, there will be a debate in the Federation Chamber tonight at around 6.30pm on a bill from Green MP Adam Bandt to legalise same sex marriage.</p> <p>Speakers tonight include two Labor Cabinet ministers - Stephen Smith and Greg Combet - both of whom support gay marriage.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51beb3f4e4b09fd3030f8850\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T08:07:35.583+01:00\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The motion passed in the senate has no impact on the Madigan bill either way - but it is interesting.</p> <p>The Opposition leader last week ruled out any deals with the pro-life senator Madigan after the September election; and said he planned no changes to abortion law.</p> <p>Abortion was actually raised as an issue by the Prime Minister last week - fighting words about how only Labor could protect women's reproductive rights.</p> <p>But Labor is yet to specify a formal position on the Madigan bill. A formulation on the proposal has been issued by a spokesman for the Health Minister Tanya Plibersek - but there's no clear position.</p> <p>If the Madigan bill ever came to a vote, Labor's national executive would have to allow a conscience vote on the question. I spoke to union boss Joe De Bruyn - National Secretary and Treasurer of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association - about this last week.</p> <p>De Bruyn's union is conservative on these questions, and he's an important figure in the Labor Right. He told me in a conversation last week there would be a conscience vote, no question.</p> <p>He declined to be drawn on the wisdom of the Prime Minister raising the abortion issue.</p> <p>De Bruyn:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't want to comment on what the Prime Minister has said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T08:11:51.499+01:00\">at 5.11pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51beb179e4b09fd3030f884f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T07:49:30.324+01:00\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While I was chasing the fate of the reach rule, going .. going .. the senate has passed a motion expressing concern about gender selection abortions.</p> <p>This motion relates to a private members bill from the Democratic Labor Party Senator John Madigan which aims to take away Medicare funding for terminations allegedly performed on the basis of gender.</p> <p>Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon is deeply cross that this has happened.

No plans to scrap the &quot;reach rule.&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With parliament entering its final fortnight, I've been chasing the fate of the last remaining element of the Gillard Government's media reforms.</p> <p>Readers who follow politics closely will know that most of the government's package to reform the media, including new enhanced powers for the Press Council to poilce newspapers and digital sites, collapsed earlier this year.</p> <p>We've been waiting to hear whether or not the government will scrap the so-called reach rule which stops a TV licence holder from reaching more than 75 &thinsp;per cent of the population. The rule is relevant to the fate of some current media mergers being proposed.</p> <p>We expect a committee report later this week recommending that the rule be scrapped.</p> <p>But too late. It looks like it's game over in any case. There won't be time to deal with this before parliament concludes.</p> <p>Here's a statement from a spokesman for the Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government awaits the parliamentary committee's report, but there are <strong>no plans to introduce legislation to repeal the 75 per cent reach rule in this sitting of parliament.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51beaa60e4b0c0afc1a50899\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T07:19:13.735+01:00\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If opinion polls are correct - issues like the market power of supermarkets will assume greater importance and prominence after the election than perhaps they have in the lead-up.</p> <p>Bob Katter and Nick Xenophon have pursued issues like divestiture powers (powers for competition authorities to break up businesses when they get too big) over many years. Katter is pursuing legislation that would bust up the supermarkets (his words).</p> <p>If the balance of power changes in the Senate, there will be more options to pursue reforms in this space.</p> <p>The Nationals are also concerned about market power and have been for many years - a fact which sometimes causes friction between the Liberal Party and their junior coalition partner. I know some Liberals are concerned about the outlook for competition policy after September if Tony Abbott wins on September 14. The Liberals are not great fans of divestiture, historically.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51bea5e6e4b0a121aed83c94\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T07:00:06.816+01:00\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick race back.

We had a lewd menu associated with a political fundraiser in Brisbane - then Perth broadcaster Howard Sattler asking Gillard whether her partner, Tim Mathieson was gay. Then there was another silly moment on the ABC's Insiders program.</p> <p>People are still pondering the impact of last week.

They find them uncomfortable because they threaten male power. The most anti-Gillard segment of the community is older white males &ndash; precisely the most privileged demographic in Australian society. For men like Alan Jones, Andrew Bolt and Howard Sattler, it really does appear as though a female prime minister threatens their sense of identity. Perhaps that's why Jones seems incapable of stopping himself referring to the prime minister as &ldquo;this woman.&rdquo;&nbsp;Andrew Bolt prefers a more subtle power dynamic: he likes to call Gillard a &ldquo;<a href=\"http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/gillard_resumes_her_misogynist_smear/\">professional victim</a>&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/17/feminism-australia-gillard-sexism\">You can find the full piece here.</a></p> <p>If you have thoughts, feel free to share either here, or on Twitter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51be9bd6e4b0a121aed83c93\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T06:17:11.453+01:00\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Prime Minister has placed further questions on the notice paper.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51be9af1e4b0c0afc1a50896\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T06:13:22.238+01:00\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/statuses/346494791867068416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Blue ties govt. front bench during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qt&amp;src=hash\">#qt</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/R0XXZxEAbe\">pic.twitter.com/R0XXZxEAbe</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bowers (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/statuses/346494791867068416\">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And here's the government.</p> <p>A very cheerful Mike Kelly at the top, and a very intense Greg Combet down the bottom of the frame.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51be9a11e4b0c0afc1a50895\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T06:09:38.592+01:00\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While the Manager of Government Business, Anthony Albanese, is up at the dispatch box with a morale booster for the Labor backbench, Mike Bowers has prepared a little something for the amusement of <strong>#politicslive</strong> readers.</p> <p>Blue ties, a collage.</p> <p>First.

Mad perhaps, but it has been a real privilege to have a ringside seat in one of the most interesting periods that I've covered in national affairs.

I'm still reading through all the pieces from this morning about Labor's leadership woes and the impact of the new opinion polls.</p> <p>Michelle Grattan from The Conversation has looked closely at the position Workplace Minister Bill Shorten currently finds himself in. And Michelle reports an interesting detail about Shorten's wife, Chloe Bryce.</p> <p>Here's Michelle:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The poll adds to the enormous pressure on powerbroker Bill Shorten, a Gillard backer who was key in making her PM, and other senior figures in the party, as well as Gillard&rsquo;s union backers.</p> <p>A shift by Shorten would tip the balance, but last night his spokeswoman reaffirmed he was still supporting Gillard.</p> <p>The leadership crisis is at an impasse with Gillard refusing to countenance stepping down and Rudd refusing to challenge.</p> <p>Shorten is being buffeted by conflicting considerations. As the one most likely to become leader in opposition, he would benefit by Rudd becoming leader now, and saving some of the &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;. Those wanting him to act argue that it is his duty for the good of the party.</p> <p>On the other hand, to be a main player in assassinating two Labor prime ministers in three years would give him an unenviable reputation for disloyalty. (Aaron Patrick&rsquo;s just published Downfall: How the Labor Party ripped itself apart, describes the decision by Shorten and other senior figures to remove a democratically elected PM in his first term of office as &ldquo;one of the great political miscalculations of the modern era&rdquo;.)</p> <p>Often overlooked, too, in the current situation is the role of Shorten&rsquo;s wife Chloe Bryce, daughter of Governor-General Quentin Bryce.</p> <p>Chloe has recently become president of the board of the newly-formed Women for Gillard group, to whom Gillard gave her speech last week. Her high profile public support for the PM would increase the difficulties of Shorten defecting, if Gillard remains determined to fight for her position.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read Michelle in full <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/men-flay-gillard-in-poll-15228\">here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51be6b73e4b0d69ce9e77dfe\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-17T02:50:44.323+01:00\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In a day of silly walks, this is very much worth your time.</p> <p>As we enter the final phase of the 43rd parliament, here are the reflections of the crossbenchers on how the last three years have gone.</p> <p>NSW Independent, Rob Oakeshott:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This parliament has been alive.</p> </blockquote> <p>(That it has.)</p> <p>NSW Independent Tony Windsor:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It took a hung parliament to find the resolve to solve the Murray Darling.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tasmania's Andrew Wiklie:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tony Abbott has been very successful in creating an atmosphere of crisis.

The Member for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman, has told his hometown paper, The Geelong Advertiser, that only Rudd can save Labor from wipeout in September. Cheeseman's comments are the front page splash.</p> <p>But what is material in this transaction is whether supporters of Julia Gillard switch camps. That's why the focus over the past week or so on the disposition of the Workplace Minister Bill Shorten - will Shorten switch his support to Kevin Rudd?</p> <p>But this is about more than Shorten in my view. It's about the group of ministers who have been loyal to Gillard throughout the cycles of this discussion Labor keeps having with itself.

We wondered whether the pressure hose clean-up may extend to the inside of the building before the week is out - such has been the build up to this final sitting fortnight. Seems amazing doesn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;ve entered the last two sitting weeks of this 43rd parliament.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s open this morning with a run through of some of the morning&rsquo;s main political stories.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;A source close to Kevin Rudd&rdquo; outlines his conditions (The Daily Telegraph)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/kevin-rudd-has-listed-his-conditions-for-a-return-as-pm/story-fni0cx12-1226664712029\">A source close to Mr Rudd revealed yesterday he would now not be part of a move to replace Ms Gillard unless key ministers, including some of Ms Gillard's supporters, declared their hand and \"owned the decision\". Several key ministers previously loyal to Ms Gillard have privately said they now supported the need for change but were reluctant to be involved in a spill. </a><a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/kevin-rudd-has-listed-his-conditions-for-a-return-as-pm/story-fni0cx12-1226664712029\">\"If they want this to happen, then they have to have the guts to put their name to it,\" one of Mr Rudd's confidantes said. \"And if they don't, they can go and fall off the cliff. No one is getting a free ride.\" Those that Mr Rudd would want to put their hand up include other ministers such as Penny Wong, Greg Combet and Jenny Macklin.</a></p> <p><strong>Polls, Part One: Nielsen (The Australian Financial Review - paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/men_in_revolt_against_gillard_4r88VPDlIdnq2pDnTaAsPI\">Julia Gillard&rsquo;s reigniting of the gender wars has imploded with male voters abandoning Labor, causing a crash in overall support for both the government and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s &shy;personal standing. The latest The Australian Financial Review/Nielsen poll also shows Labor would fare much better if it replaced Ms Gillard with Kevin Rudd but would be unlikely to win the election. Since the last poll a month ago, Labor&rsquo;s primary vote has slipped 3&thinsp;percentage points to 29&thinsp;per cent and the Coalition&rsquo;s has risen 3&thinsp;points to 47&thinsp;per cent, giving the Coalition a two-party preferred lead over Labor of 57&thinsp;per cent to 43 per cent.</a></p> <p><strong>Polls, Part Two: Eden-Monaro focus group (The Conversation)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/the-eden-monaro-project-voters-tired-of-leadership-circus-15227\">As Labor caucus members return to Canberra uncertain who will be PM at the end of this final fortnight parliamentary sitting, voters in the bellwether seat of Eden-Monaro are saying to them: just sort your situation out &ndash; we are over it. In a discussion last week, most in the University of Canberra-The Conversation focus group thought that Kevin Rudd should lead Labor into the election, because he was more popular than Julia Gillard. In general however, people were exhausted by Labor&rsquo;s internal struggle. Across the political spectrum they were tired of the &ldquo;circus&rdquo;, fueled by the media, and the way the leadership rumblings distract from what they see as more important things.</a></p> <p><strong>Time&rsquo;s running out, Part One: The bucket list of the 43rd parliament (Guardian Australia)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/16/parliament-awaits-gillard-s-bucket-list\">Cabinet will decide on Monday whether a last-ditch bid to extend federal powers to protect national parks from state government laws will be added to the legislation the government is trying to pass in the final two parliamentary sitting weeks. With just eight sitting days before parliament rises ahead of the election, the government has produced what amounts to this parliament's bucket list &ndash; the things it wants to legislate before time runs out &ndash; with changes to school funding and the requirements for employers wanting to use temporary work visas at the top.</a></p> <p><strong>Time&rsquo;s running out, Part Two: Crossbenchers say the 43rd parliament has been misunderstood (Guardian Australia)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/16/greens-independents-parliament-success\">As parliament begins its final two sitting weeks before the election and the electorate appears ready to pass a damning verdict on the government, the three independents and the Greens argue minority government has been badly misunderstood. They don't regret the decision they made after those 17 days in 2010 when they were weighing up whether Julia Gillard or Tony Abbott should be prime minister, and they firmly believe that history will judge the 43rd parliament more kindly than contemporary commentators do.</a></p> <p><strong>Victorian Premier to Tony Abbott: reform the IR system (The Australian, paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/industrial-relations/tony-abbott-should-revisit-ir-policy-says-victorian-premier-denis-napthine/story-fn59noo3-1226664754425\">Tony Abbott has been warned that the industrial relations system needs an urgent overhaul to fireproof the economy by creating greater flexibility and driving productivity. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine has called for the federal Liberal leader to embrace workplace reform if elected to power. Dr Napthine said employers and employees should be able to negotiate more freely, although with the caveat that existing entitlements remain and that there be a \"no-disadvantage\" test.</a></p> <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t burn the coal: Climate Commission (Fairfax media)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/leave-coal-in-ground-scientists-urge-government-20130616-2ocag.html\">Most of Australia's coal reserves will have to be left unburned if the world is to avoid catastrophic global warming, according to a major new report from the federal government's Climate Commission. The report puts the key science advisory body on a collision course with some of the nation's biggest export industries, and marks the first time a government agency has endorsed calls for fossil fuel industries to be phased out because of their contribution to climate change.</a></p> <p>You can follow the live updates on the blog throughout the day, or join in the conversation on Twitter using the hashtag <strong>#politicslive</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">You can follow me there @murpharoo </a></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-16T23:52:27.982+01:00\">at 8.52am AEST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Politics as it happened: Labor leadership, opinion polls and Kevin Rudd - politics live blog","trailText":"<p>MPs gather in Canberra for the final sitting fortnight of the 43rd parliament</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/16/1371422144267/66b8695e-0cea-43ac-8f79-070cabd4eee2-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"6866","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"410905173","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"51be3cd9e4b095bf2f04a56a","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy","displayRelativeTimes":"false","internalPageCode":"1923244","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-19T22:48:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/16/labor-leadership-opinion-polls-kevin-rudd","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/16/labor-leadership-opinion-polls-kevin-rudd","tags":[{"id":"politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Australia politics live with Katharine Murphy","description":"Join Guardian deputy political editor Katharine Murphy as she brings you all the day's political stories live from Canberra and beyond","type":"series","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"profile/katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Katharine Murphy","r2ContributorId":"55866","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984188542/Katharine-Murphy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984230717/Katharine-Murphy-R.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Katharine Murphy is deputy political editor for Guardian Australia.

Photograph: WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time to say goodnight. Thanks muchly as always to Paul Owen for his early shift and to Mike Bowers, hot on the tail of Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Let's wrap today:</p> <ul> <li>Tony Abbott began in Brisbane backing in his \"announceables\" from the Coaliton launch on Sunday - particularly HECs style loans for tradies and funding for dementia research.</li> <li>Abbott contended that undertaking to deliver a surplus in his first term, and then adjusting that commitment at the campaign launch on Sunday, was not a broken promise. On that surplus in term one: \"It would be foolish to give an absolute guarantee,\" Abbott said.</li> <li>Kevin Rudd began his day with a positive Newspoll blip inside the margin of error, moved on to a Sydney childcare centre, and then on to an announcement about high speed rail - specifically, legislation for the rail corridor by the end of 2013 if Labor was returned, and a new authority to oversee the project.</li> <li>The Labor leader argued that a policy like building high speed rail was more affordable that Tony Abbott's paid parental leave scheme, and would provide greater benefits to the economy as a whole.</li> <li>At lunchtime we had the Bob Katter and Clive Palmer show at the National Press Club. It was high on volume and entertainment value, and somewhat lower on uncontested facts and narrative coherence.</li> <li>Liberal frontbencher put a pinky toe off the talking points reservation on Abbott's paid parental leave scheme, by remarking how others thought the scheme hugely generous.</li> <li>Abbott ended the campaign day on the Gold Coast promising to \"suspend the marine protected areas that this Government has recently declared\" - which turned out to be a commitment to suspend the management plans rather than the parks themselves.</li> </ul> <p>That's your day on the hustings. There will be another tomorrow, and I look forward to sharing it with you. Have a lovely evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9e565719-96bb-4aee-8d11-aa162315918d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/26/1377503244241/8685b0e2-71f1-4edb-94f8-12a963497ec4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott during a tour of the Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research at University of Queensland.

It's unfortunate there are cracks in the system.\" The \"cracks\", Speers points out, is one of the audience members at the Broncos event \"lied\" and gamed the system.</p> <p>This is obviously quite embarrassing for Galaxy and for the broadcaster Sky News - that an active party member can get through to one of the forums which are marketed to audiences as a 'grass roots, swinging voters Q&amp;A' to the leaders.</p> <p>David Briggs is counselling us to look at the big picture.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her impact on the event was minimal.

Yesterday, in Brisbane, <strong>Tony Abbott's daughters</strong> did the warm up speech to connect their father to the audience both in QPAC and the TV audience watching on at home.</p> <p>I note the Labor leader Kevin Rudd got asked about the use of the family in this campaign<strong>.</strong> I thought his reply worth sharing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, this is modern Australia and I don&rsquo;t ask my family members to do anything, they want to do these things. So, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is out there, she runs her own company, she built a small business from nothing, and a $10,000 bank loan 20-25 years ago and now she employs a bunch of people. She has taken long service leave and she&rsquo;s out there helping. Jessica, my daughter, she&rsquo;s a lawyer and is a relatively new mum. We have got a 12 month old &ndash; 14 month old granddaughter and so baby Josephine is also helping by producing chaos at home, and my sons Nicholas and Marcus are all actively involved as well. Not because I&rsquo;ve asked them to, they want to because they believe, all of them, in the values we stand for, which is building Australia&rsquo;s future, not just a recipe for cut, cut and more cuts, which frankly, apart from everything else, if Mr Abbott goes through with his $70bn worth of cuts, not only is that going to hit average families in terms of costs to them, not only will it slash jobs, but also runs the real risk of throwing the Australian economy into recession at a time of great global economic uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <p>Neat segue there from the family to the day's talking point.</p> <p>As I argued in the July column, I'm a bit worried about politics redrawing the privacy boundary for itself. I understand the potency of the family as a bit of political shorthand, but I do worry about where it leads. I don't object on \"spin\" grounds - I worry at the human level for political families. Increasingly they are public figures, which is fine, until it's not.</p> <p>If you've got thoughts, feel free to chime in.

You just cut and paste press releases. You are in trouble and under pressure and you know it. Murdoch sacks his editors because they don't stand to attention quickly enough.</p> <p>Katter says yes, politicians should be more accountable. I'm an independent.

I&rsquo;d have to say &ndash; and to do a bit of a plug for your sister newspaper part of your empire here Greg &ndash; Peter Martin the really distinguished economic writer has written a very, very cogent defence of our Paid Parental Leave, he&rsquo;s a very objective guy, he doesn&rsquo;t hand bouquets around lightly. He&rsquo;s written a very good defence of that and people can read it on the Brisbane Times website or on the Sydney Morning Herald or Age websites. So I really commend that to people, yes it is generous, no question about that. But you know something? We&rsquo;ve got a vital vested interest in children, we&rsquo;ve got a vital vested interest - all of us we all have an interest in each others children. And we&rsquo;ve got a vital vested interest in women being able to better manage family and work and get that balance right.</p> <p><strong>GREG CARY: </strong>Philosophical question there is, and we only have a minute you need to be elsewhere. Is that the role of government though? At the time that Mr Abbott was talking about government getting out of our lives, smaller government, Joe Hockey&rsquo;s made the same point in the past, you&rsquo;ve made the same point. Why would government get involved in a $5.5 billion project that could be funded by others and you&rsquo;re asking others now to fund?</p> <p><strong>MALCOLM TURNBULL: </strong>It could be funded by others and in some cases it is but the reality is at the moment that a lot of women, depending on who they work for get different levels of paid parental leave and so this is a square up and it will be &ndash; it is fully funded, it will be funded by big business in large part &ndash;</p> <p><strong>GREG CARY:</strong> In large part? They&rsquo;re only saying it&rsquo;s half the part.</p> <p><strong>MALCOLM TURNBULL:</strong> Look, all the costings will be available. As you know we&rsquo;ve outlined some of it already.</p> <p><strong>GREG CARY: </strong>But a component of it will have to come from elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>MALCOLM TURNBULL:</strong> Sure, everything&rsquo;s got to be paid for and it&rsquo;s a choice Greg. It really is a choice and when people say it&rsquo;s too much or it&rsquo;s too generous it&rsquo;s a reasonable objection. It&rsquo;s always reasonable to say &lsquo;Hang on, can&rsquo;t you do this in a better way with less money?&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s our policy, it&rsquo;s a signature policy of Tony Abbott and it&rsquo;s not just his idea, we are all committed to it, you saw the enthusiasm with which it was greeted yesterday and if people want to have a meaner and less generous paid parental leave well that&rsquo;s what the Labor Party&rsquo;s offering.</p> <p><strong>GREG CARY: </strong>Well, to be fair it&rsquo;s hardly mean and less generous. It&rsquo;s very generous.</p> <p><strong>MALCOLM TURNBULL:</strong> Well it is less generous!</p> <p><strong>GREG CARY: </strong>In terms of what the rest of the world is offering it&rsquo;s way above what the rest of the world is offering.</p> <p><strong>MALCOLM TURNBULL:</strong> But isn&rsquo;t that a good thing?

Real estate bubble, mining boom over?</strong></p> <p>The future is never identical with where we are in the past, Rudd says. We have to avoid what the British conservatives did - a massive austerity drive. That would throw the eocnomy into recession. We know the road to chart in the future. We can \"navigate the shoals that lie ahead\" and there is no economy better placed to do that than the Australian economy.</p> <p><strong>Q: Did the polls give you a boost this morning?</strong></p> <p>Another smile from Rudd. We are presenting our plan every day, he says. We are out there with our agenda. Australians are focusing on the contrast. Like this one: high speed rail is cheaper and more beneficial to the eocnomy than Abbott's PPL. \"I think Australians are focusing on those clear points of contrast.\"</p> <p><strong>Q: Syria? Military strikes?</strong></p> <p>Let's take this one step at a time, Rudd says. UN inspections first. We need to establish the complicity of the regime. The attack was terrible, this is not the Somme, this is 2013, Rudd says. We need to establish the facts.</p> <p><strong>Q: If you didn't have a mandate for the carbon tax - why did you vote for it?</strong></p> <p>We had a mandate to act on climate change, Rudd says. We had a mandate to ratify Kyoto, to boost renewable energy. We had a mandate to price carbon. We are moving to a floating price.</p> <p><strong>Q: Foreign investment - Abbott is talking about lowering the threshold, what will China say about that?</strong></p> <p>What's Abbott's actual position? I'm an economic nationalist, Rudd says. I want to build the industries of the future. We need investment from home and abroad. I'll put Aussie jobs first, Rudd says.</p> <p><strong>Q: To Albanese, on the second airport: why is it less urgent than it was ten years ago?</strong></p> <p>It isn't less urgent. We've been working away on it, Albanese says. \"I've had a considered approach to it - I make no apology for it.\" I'm trying to bring people with me, and to make this bipartisan.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521ab685e4b04c508c463b82\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-26T02:59:34.031+01:00\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rudd looks exhausted.

He segues to Tony Abbott's PPL scheme: that's money paid - more money than for a high speed rail line, and once it's gone it's gone. High speed rail has a productivity dividend. (I think this is a brave line of argument from Albanese in the Humphrey Appleby sense.)</p> <p><strong>Q: Second Sydney airport? Will this ever happen?</strong></p> <p>We favour it, Albanese says. We proceed with this in an evidence-based way.</p> <p><strong>Q: How about developing a west coast mega-region?</strong></p> <p>Fine, but population right now is on the east coast, Albanese says. I'm passionate about WA and infrastructure, Rudd says.

The Labor leader and his deputy Anthony Albanese are in Sydney: builders, who got the \"big calls\" right on the economy, particularly during the GFC. That's Rudd's opening this morning. What is Tony Abbott's vision for the country, Kevin Rudd inquires?</p> <p>We are the infrastructure \"pumpers\" Rudd suggests. We are building the national broadband network. We are for the jobs of the future. Anthony Albanese has been flat out on infrastructure, Rudd says.</p> <p>Today we are speaking about high speed rail, Rudd says. Labor will legislate to preserve a corridor for high speed rail from Brisbane to Melbourne. There will be an authority to oversee this project.</p> <p>He says this high speed rail project is better than Tony Abbott's PPL scheme. PPL, Rudd says, benefits a small group of people, but everyone in Australia has to pay for it. That's the Abbott model for government Rudd suggests - a small group benefits and everyone pays. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521ab142e4b055bf6bac881f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-26T02:37:06.860+01:00\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An outbreak of \"meta\" has hit the campaign buses this morning.

(I've got this, really I have, it's my time, the other mob are all out of time.)</p> <p><strong>Kevin Rudd</strong> is trying to pivot out of that conclusion, trying to disrupt the growing sense of inevitability about a change of government in Canberra. Labor is trying to preserve the hesitation factor about Abbott. (You can't trust him, his priorities are all wrong, he's got a whole secret agenda that he's not telling you about.)</p> <p>Funny isn't it? Both of these candidates are trying to tell voters this election is all about you, all about the voter. But right now, it's all about them: Abbott convincing you it's his moment, Rudd convincing you it is not Abbott's moment.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521a9013e4b04c508c463b77\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-26T00:15:31.797+01:00\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you want to see <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWU6tVxzO1I\">Julian Assange</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWU6tVxzO1I\"> in a mullet wig and Australia T-shirt, miming to a soft rock campaign tune</a> on the internet-based Juice Rap News, erm ... well ... now you can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWU6tVxzO1I\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QWU6tVxzO1I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>It must be said that Assange's song is at least better than the Australia theme tune the Coalition used throughout their campaign launch yesterday.</p> <p>The ball's in your court, Kevin ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521a8734e4b055bf6bac8816\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-25T23:37:40.718+01:00\">8.37am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tony Burke, the immigration minister</strong>, has revealed that when he was offered the job soon after siding with Julia Gillard when Kevin Rudd ousted her, he asked: \"Is this some form of retribution?\" It was not a job anyone would go for, he said.</p> <p>He also shed some light on his relationship with Rudd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bizarrely, in the first term, Kevin and I didn't have a functioning relationship.

Burnside said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many Australians want a new way, a more human way, and what we've shown today is that [this] is cost-effective as well as being the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Greens say the parliamentary budget office has shown the move would save $3.2bn.

The front pages today are dominated by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/tony-abbott-campaign-launch-trust-me-to-govern-says-coalition-leader\">Coalition&rsquo;s campaign launch yesterday</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/federal-election\">Daily Telegraph runs with</a> a shot of Tony Abbott with his wife, his daughters, and deputy opposition leader Julie Bishop all smiling and laughing. &ldquo;Abbott deploys his not-so-secret weapons: Girl Power,&rdquo; is the paper&rsquo;s headline &ndash; an obvious riposte to claims Abbott has a problem attracting female voters.</p> <p>Unusually, the Australian Financial Review uses a very similar picture to the Telegraph, focusing on &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/abbott_abandons_first_term_surplus_AnD7dilpQ2W0gAdMNLtfYN\">Abbott&rsquo;s 10-year agenda</a>&rdquo;. But the story itself is not uniformly positive, beginning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tony Abbott has abandoned his intention to return the budget to surplus in the first term of a Coalition government, saying instead that voters would know before the 2016 election when the economy would be back in the black.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sydney Morning Herald also emphasises Abbott&rsquo;s change in position on the deficit, and carries the ambiguous headline: &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/take-me-on-trust-tony-abbott-20130825-2sjzy.html\">Take me on trust: Abbott</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Australian has a more serious picture of the Abbotts, under the headline: &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/election-2013/tony-abbott-pledges-competence-trust-in-pitch-to-be-next-pm/story-fn9qr68y-1226703816618\">Abbott pledges competence, trust</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The paper <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/election-2013/alp-vote-recovers-but-defeat-looming-newspoll-figures-show/story-fn9qr68y-1226703816948\">also has a Newspoll</a> that shows the Coalition down one to 53% on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/how-does-australia-s-voting-system-work\">two-party-preferred basis</a>, with Labor on 47%. This is the first Newspoll rise for Labor since the election was called, but it is within the margin of error of two points. The poll shows Labor&rsquo;s primary vote up three to 37% with the Coalition's unchanged at 47%. Kevin Rudd was up a point to 44% as preferred prime minister, with Abbott down one to 40%. Again these shifts were within the margin of error.</p> <p>Today Rudd will be in Sydney and is expected to focus on Abbott&rsquo;s refusal so far to detail his party&rsquo;s policy costings, as well as what he said in an email to supporters was &ldquo;what has always been the number one priority for this Labor government &ndash; jobs&rdquo;, while the opposition leader is still in Brisbane following his campaign launch there yesterday.</p> <p><strong>Katharine Murphy</strong> and I will have all the news from the campaign throughout the day right here.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-25T22:31:11.520+01:00\">at 7.31am AEST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Election 2013: Labor and Kevin Rudd show slight gains in poll - politics live blog - as it happened","trailText":"<p>Newspoll shows first rise for ALP since election campaign began – but it is within the margin of error</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/22/1377151382394/b9397799-83c0-4fdf-bd0d-12e50e665458-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"8524","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"415825188","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"521a76c8e4b0687f4f86862e","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy and Paul Owen","displayRelativeTimes":"true","internalPageCode":"1955846","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-28T21:38:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/election-2013-labor-and-kevin-rudd-show-slight-gains-in-poll-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/aug/25/election-2013-labor-and-kevin-rudd-show-slight-gains-in-poll-politics-live-blog","tags":[{"id":"world/australian-election-2013","webTitle":"Australian election 2013","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-election-2013","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-election-2013","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/labor-party","webTitle":"Labor party","description":"Latest news and comment on the Labor party and Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/labor-party","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/labor-party","references":[]},{"id":"world/liberal-party","webTitle":"Liberal party","description":"Latest news and views about Australia's Liberal party from the Guardian","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberal-party","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/liberal-party","references":[]},{"id":"world/kevin-rudd","webTitle":"Kevin Rudd","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kevin-rudd","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kevin-rudd","references":[]},{"id":"world/tony-abbott","webTitle":"Tony Abbott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/tony-abbott","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paulowen","webTitle":"Paul Owen","r2ContributorId":"19197","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/01/17/Paul_Owen.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Owen is a Guardian journalist.

Foreign investment is one of those issue that burbles away in the background, but flares up when there are highly contentious transactions.</p> <p>One of the interesting things to watch if Tony Abbott wins on September 7 will be how the economic rationalists within the Liberals deal with the less economically rational Nationals over issues like foreign investment. (Of course it's not just foreign investment creating cracks between the coalition partners, there are burbling disagreements over paid parental leave - the Nats don't care for Abbott's policy; and over the future direction of competition policy).</p> <p>I'll let Gabby take over the narration now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The power struggle between the Liberals and the Nationals is intensifying as the likelihood of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/coalition\">Coalition</a> victory grows, with foreign investment the latest subject of disagreement.</p> <p>The Nationals are stepping up pressure on the Liberals to tighten the rules around agricultural foreign investment and have urged an incoming Liberal Treasurer, in the event of a Coalition win on 7 September, to block the sale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia\">Australia</a>'s largest agribusiness, GrainCorp, to the US multinational Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).</p> <p>New South Wales Nationals senator Fiona Nash called for \"more stringent scrutiny of the national interest test\" by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and said she had already discussed the GrainCorp sale with Tony Abbott.</p> <p>\"The national interest is very fluid in interpretation,\" Nash told Guardian Australia.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521c29b4e4b0687f4f8686e3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-27T05:23:16.872+01:00\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Having begun his day in Sydney, been clipped over the ears harbourside by Barry O'Farrell, Kevin Rudd is now in Brisbane.

Getting there was a large and disruptive process, but we are there now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is unprecedented transparency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Getting the states to keep providing data is a big challenge, but I'm insisting. The next frontier for reform is primary care. We need better record keeping and relationships between GPs and patients.</p> <p><strong>Dutton:</strong> We are not taking $1.8bn from health as Labor says. Our intention is to boost frontline services.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let's not sugar coat what's happened over the last six years.</p> </blockquote> <p>There's no revoltion in health as Labor suggests. The former health minister Nicola Roxon said Kevin Rudd was dysfunctional. Health reform all nearly fell apart. Julia Gillard compromised with the states to get the national health agreement through. This was a missed opportunity - people in health know it was a missed opportunity.

We will look at ways of streamlining that, he says. Some of these agencies might fold into other agencies. We'll keep the programs though.</p> <p><strong>Plibersek:</strong> Let's talk agencies: which ones will close? The organ authority? The blood and tissue authority? Time for specifics Peter, she says. Obesity in kids has flatlined, not so for adults. We have to press on with obesity initiatives. Alcohol is a more complicated problem - there are safe levels of consumption unlike tobacco. Labelling is important. So is work on foetal alcohol syndrome.</p> <p><em>Q: Indigenous health - why is there only one mention of indigenous people in your health policy Peter Dutton?</em></p> <p>Because we are not finished yet, Dutton tells the reporter from NITV at the NPC.

He's committed to funding over the forward estimates.</p> <p><strong>Plibersek</strong> says not good enough. Why won't the Liberals guarantee funding out to 2020? And what happens to Medicare Locals? Tony Abbott isn't committed to keeping them, is he?</p> <p><strong>Dutton:</strong> We'll conduct a review of Medicare Locals, yes. Some have done well, some of these things aren't actually working. Look at the detail of what we've said: it's at odds with your scare campaign Tanya.</p> <p><strong>Plibersek:</strong> You wanted to get rid of them and the community pushed you back.

Where ever it is possible, the Liberal health spokesman says, \"we want to devolve power down to the local level.\"</p> <p><strong>Plibersek</strong> says there is already a lot of control at the local level through boards and through Medicare Locals. She says the change in the model to activity based funding is the big reform driver. She says Canberra does not run hospitals and doesn't seek to.</p> <p><em>Q: A question on out-of-pocket health expenses. Why has Labor made health more expensive for ordinary people? Why should a chronically ill person vote Labor?</em></p> <p><strong>Plibersek:</strong> \"Because the best chance people have of a decent health care system is always under Labor.\" Bulk billing is at historic highs now, she says. Plibersek queries the data about out of pocket expenses - she suggests it covers all kinds of things: bandaids, condoms. Every one has a right to present fro treatment at a public hospital.</p> <p><strong>Dutton:</strong> They can't manage the budget, that's why they have tightened up health programs and increased the out of pocket costs on voters. This is about the budget bottomline. Dutton says he's certain Plibersek would have argued against these measures.</p> <p><em>Q: RU486 and abortion, a question to Peter Dutton?

And e-health. We have to use technology to our advantage, Dutton says. Labor has spent $1bn and the system is far from comprehensive. Then GP super clinics - promised since 2007. Only half are open, and there's no evidence they are taking traffic away from emergency rooms. He says the Coalition will provide grants and that will work better. Then medical research.

Here's Guardian Australia <strong>Lenore Taylor's</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/26/tony-abbott-work-for-dole-tough-new-rules\">news lead</a> from this morning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Coalition is to reannounce a 2010 election promise to pay the relocation costs of long-term unemployed people who move for work, even though Labor has since implemented the plan with limited success.</p> <p>The Coalition leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott\">Tony Abbott</a>, will on Tuesday unveil an employment participation policy almost identical to the one he took to the last election, including tough new work-for-the-dole rules as well as bonuses of $2500 for long-term unemployed young people who get a job and keep it for a year, and an additional bonus of $4000 if they remain employed for a second year.</p> <p>The policy also includes assistance of $6000 for any long-term unemployed person who moves to a regional area to take a job, $3000 if they move to a city and an additional $3000 if they have dependent children.</p> <p>Since the last election Labor has implemented a similar scheme &ndash; at a cost of around $30m &ndash; offering similar amounts to long-term jobseekers who move, but it has suffered from limited take-up. Under Labor's scheme the number of available places is capped, but demand has never reached that limit.</p> </blockquote> <p>So as we noted in coverage of the press conference - Abbott was asked why he'd do this given the field evidence suggests only limited success. There were two answers: it's the right thing to do because if it works, it changes lives; and Noel Pearson likes it.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521bcfc3e4b055bf6bac889f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-27T03:13:16.178+01:00\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ikea</strong> has introduced a new range of furniture to mark the election: the Abbutt: \"a traditional Ikea kitchen concept that has been updated with a recent 'modern' makeover\" and the Ruddik, which \"draws inspiration from designs and accessories popular in the late noughties\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/statuses/371881318629392384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>LOVE this cheeky campaign from IKEA.

I'm not against moving military assets - I am against policy on the run.</p> <p><em>Q: PPL? Will it be knocked back by the parliament. Other signature policies?</em></p> <p>They won't be knocked back by the parliament because we will have a mandate., Abbott says. I am happy to be the champion of fairness and progress when it comes to PPL. This is a long overdue watershed reform.</p> <p><em>Q: The government already has a relocation allowance, why have we got another one? And last campaign, in 2010, you spent a day campaigning at Essendon, do you plan on doing that again?</em></p> <p>I didn't spend a day at Essendon, Abbott says. These Essendon issues need cleaning up. We've got to see this resolved quickly and fairly as soon as possible. I'm relaxed and comfortable about the people I've associated with throughout the years. On the relocation announcement, Abbott says the policy was developed in consulation with Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson. The success of this policy is in changed lives. If 500 or 5,000 or \"any people\" take advantage of it, then I'll be happy, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: Debt and deficit - you've gone about this constantly. Why have you now shifted the goal posts on the surplus?</em></p> <p>We'll do at least as well as the government on the surplus, Abbott says. Trouble is we don't know the starting point. Treasury says there are substantial downside risks to their PEFO forecasts. Paying down debt and deficit is a very important priority and we are going to do it much better than the Labor Party. It's hard to say precisely when when you don't have a starting point.</p> <p><em>Q: What's the timetable?

The taskforce will advise about the relocation of the Sydney assets to Brisbane and Western Australia.</p> <p>The taskforce would be comprised of three experts, plus the chief of Navy.</p> <p>Rudd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a continuum in defence force poilcy and we intend to adhere to the recommendations in the defence posture review.</p> </blockquote> <p>The taskforce investigation will take 24 months, he says.</p> <p>The relocation would be done by 2030.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521be498e4b055bf6bac88a1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-27T00:28:25.381+01:00\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rudd has walked back to the global financial crisis, and forward to the G20 summit in Brisbane.

This week we assume the presidency of the UN Security Council. We assume it smack bang in the middle of the crisis in Syria.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a crisis of historic proportions.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are no victors in wars such as these - \"only victims\", Rudd says.

He later clarified that he'd back in Kevin Rudd.</strong></li> <li><strong>Bob Katter said he&rsquo;d support Rudd, as did Craig Thomson.</strong></li> <li><strong>After question time, Julia Gillard announced she would call a leadership ballot at a caucus meeting at 7pm.</strong></li> <li><strong>She challenged Kevin Rudd to step forward, and make a commitment that if he lost he'd quit politics.</strong></li> <li><strong>He did so around 5pm, announcing he would be a contender for the Labor leadership.</strong></li> <li><strong>Caucus met at 7pm.</strong></li> <li><strong>Rudd prevailed in the ballot 57 votes to 45.</strong></li> <li><strong>A strong group of ministers resigned - Wayne Swan, Stephen Conroy, Peter Garrett, Craig Emerson, Greg Combet, Joe Ludwig.</strong></li> <li><strong>Anthony Albanese emerged as Rudd's deputy.</strong></li> <li><strong>Penny Wong replaced Stephen Conroy as senate leader.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9cc7dc78-68d7-41cc-936f-1b0690be5336\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372251976310/030f5d1a-abef-4a10-adb6-adeed19b61e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Deputy Anthony Albanese.

Some crucial crossbench independents have not yet guaranteed their backing. Gillard last night asked the governor general, Quentin Bryce, to commission Rudd as prime minister.</p> <p>Speaking after the ballot, a composed Gillard said she was proud of her achievements in what &ldquo;has not been an easy environment to work in&rdquo; because of the minority parliament, the internal Labor divisions and the Coalition&rsquo;s fierce anti-carbon tax campaign.</p> <p>Referring to the accusations that she had &ldquo;played the gender card&rdquo; by calling out sexism, she said her position as the first female incumbent &ldquo;does not explain everything about my prime ministership and does not explain nothing about my prime ministership&rdquo;. She said: &ldquo;It explains some things and it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey.&rdquo;</p> <p>When he announced his candidacy, Rudd promised &ldquo;no retributions, no paybacks, none of that stuff&rdquo;, but Gillard, the treasurer, Wayne Swan, the climate change minister, Greg Combet, the education minister, Peter Garrett, and the trade minister, Craig Emerson, all immediately announced they were standing down from the frontbench. Gillard, Garrett and Emerson said they would not contest the forthcoming election.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T13:24:34.438+01:00\">at 10.24pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51cadc33e4b03c1cfe864614\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T13:19:00.827+01:00\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stephen Conroy has resigned as Communications MInister</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ConroyMO/statuses/349863996100313088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Can confirm Conroy has resigned.

Welcome to our live coverage of the Labor leadership stoush from Canberra.</p> <p>If you are just joining us this evening, here&rsquo;s the story so far.</p> <p>The day opened with news that two crossbenchers - Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott - will not contest the election in September.</p> <p>Oakeshott gave the news to his local paper. Windsor announced his intentions at an emotional press conference.</p> <p>The Rudd forces circulated a petition in an effort to force the Labor leadership stand-off to a conclusion.</p> <p>Given the story had clearly entered a new phase, the cross bench players were asked about their disposition in the event of a no confidence motion in the government.</p> <p>Windsor signalled he would likely vote against Labor if Kevin Rudd returned to the leadership.</p> <p>Oakeshott sat on the fence, as did Andrew Wilkie.</p> <p>Bob Katter said he&rsquo;d support Rudd, as did Craig Thomson.</p> <p>The day rolled to Question Time with no clear news of whether there would be a special caucus meeting to resolve the issue, or whether the petition had been sighted by the caucus chairman</p> <p>Tony Abbott moved a suspension of the standing orders in an effort to generate debate about whether Australia should go to an election now, not in September.</p> <p>The suspension failed.</p> <p>After Question Time the prime minister called a leadership ballot for 7pm this evening.</p> <p>Just after 5pm, Kevin Rudd announced he would be a candidate in that ballot. Rudd said if he didn&rsquo;t win the ballot, then Labor was heading for a catastrophic defeat.</p> <p>Both Gillard and Rudd say they will quit politics if they lose the ballot this evening.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T09:08:40.017+01:00\">at 6.08pm AEST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Labor leadership spill: Julia Gillard v Kevin Rudd - as it happened","trailText":"<p>Live coverage of the ALP leadership ballot, in which prime minister Julia Gilard is standing against former PM Kevin Rudd</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372235966366/Kevin-Rudd-announces-lead-009.jpg","wordcount":"4592","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"411580002","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"51ca9945e4b0641559b08c63","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy","displayRelativeTimes":"true","internalPageCode":"1927901","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-29T08:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/26/labor-leadership-spill-gillard-rudd-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/26/labor-leadership-spill-gillard-rudd-live","tags":[{"id":"politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Australia politics live with Katharine Murphy","description":"Join Guardian deputy political editor Katharine Murphy as she brings you all the day's political stories live from Canberra and beyond","type":"series","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-election-2013","webTitle":"Australian election 2013","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-election-2013","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-election-2013","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Katharine Murphy","r2ContributorId":"55866","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984188542/Katharine-Murphy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984230717/Katharine-Murphy-R.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Katharine Murphy is deputy political editor for Guardian Australia.

Campaign Abbott has self-evidently attempted to get ahead of one of Labor's major political attack lines today and this evening: where are your costings? No, seriously, where are they?</p> <p>Today we got the Coalition's savings measures, mainly associated with the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes. We got official confirmation that the Coalition will also trouser Labor's savings in the economic statement: the efficiency dividend, the tobacco excise hike and the bank levy. We got the costings for the paid parental leave scheme too to try and take some of the sting out of Labor's critique of the scheme on affordability grounds. So a minor step forward.</p> <p>Of course the picture we have is still partial. Most of what was released today was already known. The Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb press conference was a bit of smoke and mirrors and favourable accounting twerks [there, I said it, accounting twerks] to get through the key campaign events today - not, on any reasonable mesaure, a substantive advance.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521d8a0ce4b0ca9a4cf92fa9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-28T06:26:37.011+01:00\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, the work of the campaign goes on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9bc1ac4c-44c9-47f4-a0fc-17a2488922c7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/28/1377667375757/89c044c0-f407-4018-a6a8-ff44e0fd5d79-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin waits for her boss at a function in Sydney to where Mr Abbott signed the Jawun Empowered Communities compact this afternoon Wednesday 28th August 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Tony Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin waits for her boss at a function in Sydney where Mr Abbott signed the Jawun Empowered Communities compact this afternoon.

On August 24th (the day before the fair) another poll suggested five Labor-held seats in western Sydney could fall, including one around Homebush and another at neighbouring Parramatta.</p> <p>Over the past 30 years, immigration has transformed these once working-class Labor heartlands into modern Australia&rsquo;s new frontier&mdash;and muddied their political allegiances.

The most serious of these charges were dropped last week following<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/interpol-drops-murder-sayed-abdellatif\"> an investigation by Guardian Australia</a>.</p> <p>Writing from the Villawood immigration detention facility in Sydney, Abdellatif expressed satisfaction at the dropping of the most severe charges on the Interpol &ldquo;red notice&rdquo;: &ldquo;The announcement that Interpol has withdrawn the charges of &lsquo;premeditated murder, destruction of property, and possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives&rsquo;, is the first step to show that I am innocent of all the charges.&rdquo;</p> <p>He added that he would be contesting all the remaining charges, of membership of an illegal, extremist group and of creating forged travel documents, that remain on the red notice: &ldquo;There is no basis in truth to the remaining two charges against me. The charge of forging of travel documents does not exist in the court papers of the 1999 trial.</p> <p>&ldquo;As for the charge of &lsquo;membership of an illegally-formed extremist organisation&rsquo;, I have never been a member of such an organisation.

Julia Gillard's supporters and defenders are slipping away, and Kevin Rudd faces increasing pressure to drop his unrealistic conditions of being drafted and to stand. At some stage the trajectories of the Prime Minister's ebbing support and the growing realisation that the former prime minister must challenge will intersect and force a resolution.

It comes as the Coalition continues its attack over the continuing boat arrivals and as the government seeks to force the Coalition to explain how it will make good on its promise to \"stop the boats\" within the first term of a Tony Abbott-led government. The Coalition immigration spokesman, Scott Morrison, left open the possibility of suspending or renegotiating Australia's commitment to the UN convention on refugees, when he told Sky News on Tuesday that the way it was \"woven into\" Australian law was \"open for discussion\".</a> (Guardian Australia)</p> <p><strong>Government ads could be outside the guidelines</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/ads-should-not-run-watchdog/story-fn59niix-1226666537300\">The independent advertising watchdog has warned that some of Labor's pre-election advertising campaigns for its disability and education reforms may not be compliant with the government's own advertising guidelines.

The company this week announced it would attempt to slash wages at its Australian manufacturing plants. On Wednesday, managing director Mike Devereux also flagged that the company's future in the country was not certain if government funding was not locked in over a long period.</a> (Fairfax Media)</p> <p>You can follow our live updates throughout the day on the blog, or join in the conversation on Twitter using the hashtag #<strong>politicslive</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">You can follow me there @murpharoo</a></p> </div>   </div>","headline":"Politics as it happened: Asylum, detention and Indonesia - politics live blog","trailText":"<p>Julia Gillard to go to Indonesia, a debate on asylum, and more Labor leadership rumbling - all the action from the day in parliament</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/20/1371688077984/eee416c4-a0be-4426-b1d7-02488f1597e5-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"5533","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"411185585","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"51c249d9e4b09bc199789ddb","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy","displayRelativeTimes":"false","internalPageCode":"1925154","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-23T00:31:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/asylum-detention-indoneisa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/20/asylum-detention-indoneisa","tags":[{"id":"politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Australia politics live with Katharine Murphy","description":"Join Guardian deputy political editor Katharine Murphy as she brings you all the day's political stories live from Canberra and beyond","type":"series","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-katharine-murphy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"profile/katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Katharine Murphy","r2ContributorId":"55866","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984188542/Katharine-Murphy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/22/1405984230717/Katharine-Murphy-R.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Katharine Murphy is deputy political editor for Guardian Australia.
