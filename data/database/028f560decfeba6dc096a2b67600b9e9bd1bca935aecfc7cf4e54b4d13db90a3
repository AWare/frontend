He insisted he had never met his accusers, let alone molested them.</p><p>As he left the court building the actor said: \"In these situations there are no winners and I think we should all be much kinder to ourselves. Now, if you will excuse me, I would like to get back to work.\"</p><p>In front of a packed courtroom, Roache's legal team argued that the police investigation and subsequent trial had been \"infected\" by the torrent of abuse allegations made against Jimmy Savile and other celebrities after the entertainer's death in 2011. The \"spectre\" of Savile loomed large, claimed Roache's barrister, Louise Blackwell QC, as she accused the complainants of jumping on a bandwagon.</p><p></p><p>The actor stood in the dock as the unanimous verdicts were delivered, his face giving little away. The bald headed bodyguard who has ushered him in and out of court for the past three and a half weeks clapped as he was released from the dock.</p><p>The jury spent five hours and 59 minutes deliberating before coming into court to deliver the verdicts at 11.19am.</p><p>Roache's youngest son, James, dissolved into tears with a hand over his face; his brother Linus also wiped away tears and Roache's youngest daughter, Verity, was hugged before she also began to weep.</p><p>One of Roache's minders sprung to his feet and shouted: \"Yes!\" and began to clap before the judge told him to be quiet.</p><p>After the jury of eight women and four men delivered their not-guilty verdicts, Roache's lawyer asked if the defendant could be discharged from the dock and the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde agreed.</p><p>\"Mr Roache you are free to leave the dock,\" he said.</p><p>Blackwell said she would be applying for the defendant's legal costs to be paid by the taxpayer.</p><p>Roache smiled as he passed three of his four children as he left the dock.</p><p></p><p>The prosecution's case was that Roache put on a performance in the witness box, just as he has on the Coronation Street set for the past 53 years. \"Mr Roache presents a fictional image of himself for a living – it is a skill central to his work and fame,\" said Anne Whyte QC for the prosecution, as she opened the case.</p><p>Each day Roache arrived at court in a chauffeur-driven car from his luxury home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He faced the waiting photographers flanked by a burly, bald bodyguard and three of his four children – actors Linus and James and their sister, Verity.</p><p>Fifty-year-old Linus, who starred as Bruce Wayne's father in the 2005 film Batman Begins, was in court to hear his father admit to repeatedly cheating on his mother, Anna Cropper, who died in 2007. Roache confessed to infidelity during the period the alleged assaults took place, but insisted that he was never interested in underage girls, only \"mature and willing\" partners.</p><p>The Coronation Street cast also stood by him, with three co-stars giving evidence under oath. Anne Kirkbride, his on-off screen wife Deirdre Barlow for more than 40 years, described Roache as \"a perfect gentleman\" who always behaved \"impeccably\". Chris Gascoyne, who plays his son, Peter Barlow, said Roache was an inspiration, while Helen Worth, best known to viewers as Gail Platt, described him as the soap's \"elder statesman\".</p><p>Roache ended up in the dock after a woman called police last year claiming Roache had raped her when she was 14 or 15 in his bungalow in the Lancashire village of Haslingden.</p><p>Appearing via videolink, the woman – now 62 – told the jury she came forward following a conversation with her son in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal and those of other well-known figures, such as the late Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, Cyril Smith.</p><p>She said her son remarked on how strange it was that those accusing the men had waited so long to make their allegations. The son testified to say his mother eventually, and reluctantly, explained that the delay was perfectly understandable, and that she too had been the victim of a sex assault by a famous man. He badgered her to call the police until she gave in, telling the jury he was \"like a dog with a bone\".</p><p>The woman eventually accused Roache of raping her twice, the second time at another property he owned in Haslingden.</p><p>The other four complainants came forward following publicity over Roache's arrest for the alleged rapes. One woman, now 63, claimed Roache had assaulted her when she was 14 in the men's toilets at Granada Studios, where Coronation Street was filmed. Giving evidence she also told the jury she \"believed\" she had been assaulted at a later date in the actor's car, but couldn't remember for sure – her uncertainty caused the judge, Tim Holroyde QC, to instruct the jury to find Roache not guilty on that charge halfway through the trial.</p><p>A third woman, who was an actor, told the court that Roache groped her in his Coronation Street dressing room in 1965. She was 16 at the time. She described how he fondled her breasts over her bra, before telling her that he would pull some strings to get her a role in the show if she \"played ball\", as the prosecution put it.</p><p>The final two complainants were sisters who alleged that Roache had assaulted them on separate occasions between June 1968 and October 1970, when they were under 16. They said they met the actor when hanging around Granada Studios in Manchester, hoping for a glimpse of their favourite stars. The older sister, now 59, claimed that Roache molested her after a tour of the Rover's Return, Coronation Street's pub. Her younger sister, now 57, said he forced her to masturbate him in his Rolls-Royce when he gave her and a friend a lift home from the studios.</p><p>But the jury did not believe the women. It was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of these serious crimes.</p><p>In court, Blackwell had argued that the case against Roache was \"nonsense\". In her closing speech, she reminded the jury of the glowing testimonies given about the defendant by his co-stars.</p><p>\"You may well have had preconceptions about Mr Roache when you saw him give evidence,\" Blackwell said.</p><p>\"Did he appear to you as a gentle, nice, lovely man? What the prosecution say is that for some weird reason between 1965 and 1972, for no discernible reason, Mr Roache departed from his usual character and behaviour and became a young woman-snatcher, a risk-taker, taking people into toilets.</p><p>\"Then as soon as this madness is visited upon him, it passes. It's nonsense, it just doesn't happen in the real world. An expression, ladies and gentlemen: a leopard doesn't change its spots. How do you hide that and completely stop it for the next 42 years from 1972? Well, you don't.\"</p><p>The barrister asked the jury not to \"fall into the trap\" of thinking there may be other women out there, in the \"post-Jimmy Savile, post-Cyril Smith era\".</p><p>\"There are five women,\" she said. \"Not 25 or 500 and none of them, nobody suggests, after 1972. Where has this risk-taking libido gone to? Well, it's never been there. There's not a shred of evidence anywhere else in Mr Roache's life that he was this risk-taking predator.\"</p><p>Roache is now expected to return to Coronation Street. He hasn't appeared in the soap since 29 April last year, when Deirdre announced that Ken had taken an impromptu holiday.</p>","headline":"Coronation Street actor Bill Roache cleared of rape and sexual assault","trailText":"Lawyers for Roache argued that trial had been 'infected' by  torrent of abuse allegations  against Jimmy Savile and others<br />","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mf5m","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391690529239/William-Roache-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391690529239/William-Roache-006.jpg","wordcount":"1301","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"428954133","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8647289","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Pidd, northern editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038441","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T11:28:39Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/06/bill-roache-cleared-rape-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/feb/06/bill-roache-cleared-rape-sexual-assault","tags":[{"id":"uk/ukcrime","webTitle":"Crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/coronation-street","webTitle":"Coronation Street","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/6/22/1277217764498/Helen-Pidd-byline.-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

No extra money for building new flood defences in future was announced.</p><p>The communities secretary told MPs the weather had been \"savage\" and paid tribute to \"the work of councils, the staff on the ground from the Environment Agency and the emergency services - they have literally gone through hell and high water.\"</p><p>Pickles, who noted existing flood defences had protected 1.2m homes, added: \"It is evident that flood defences had taken a real pounding. There will be an urgent review of how to restore and maintain flood defences in target condition.\" He said a long-term strategy for flood protection running to 2021 would be delivered by the autumn.</p><p>Pickles criticised the Environment Agency chairman, Lord Smith, who had suggested there was a choice between protecting \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/03/flood-protection-town-country-environment-agency-warns\" title=\"\">front rooms or farmland</a>\", with Pickles saying lessons would be learned from recent problems including \"the local accountability of quangos\".</p><p>Shadow environment secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \"The government was caught out by the floods and it took far too long for ministers to realised the seriousness of the situation. There have been 21 meeting of [emergency committee] Cobra but it is far from clear what all the talk has achieved.\" She also accused ministers of \"fiddling the figures\" over flood defence spending, after Pickles used a different baseline from that of Cameron on Wednesday. Annual flood defence spending <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/david-cameron-claim-flood-spending\" title=\"\">fell by 15% under the coalition</a>.</p><p>Pickles, who was standing in for the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, who is having emergency eye surgery, also confirmed changes to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bellwin-scheme-2013-to-2014-guidance\" title=\"\">Bellwin scheme</a>, through which councils can claim funding for damage repairs.

They said up to 1.6 inches (40mm) of rain is being predicted to fall on the south coast, where many areas are already drenched from recent storms and floods.</p><p>Upland areas including Salisbury Plain, the South Downs and North Downs are set to be the worst affected by the downpours, and the Met Office has issued an amber warning for the area, urging locals to \"be prepared\".

We must all raise our voices against attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people,\" he said. \"We must oppose the arrests, imprisonments and discriminatory restrictions they face.\"</p><p>\"The United Nations stands strongly behind our own 'free and equal' campaign, and I look forward to working with the IOC, governments and other partners around the world to build societies of equality and tolerance. Hatred of any kind must have no place in the 21st century.\"</p><p>It emerged last week that more than 50 current and former Olympians have called on the IOC to uphold principle six of its charter, which forbids discrimination of any kind, and this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/06/sochi-games-anti-gay-blasphemy-laws-russia-putin-letter-writers\" title=\"\">more than 200 writers added their voice to the protest </a>against the new laws in a letter to the Guardian.</p><p>Ban did not refer specifically to Russia's new laws, which ban the promotion of \"non-traditional\" sexual relations to under-18s, but his words carry strong symbolic weight.</p><p>Speaking to reporters after his address, Ban, who is due to carry the Olympic torch and meet Putin in Sochi on Thursday, added: \"I know there has been some controversy over this issue. At the same time I appreciate the assurances of President Putin that there will be no discrimination and that people with different sexual orientation are welcome to compete and enjoy this Olympic Games.\"</p><p>Asked about the new laws, the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak insisted that there was no discrimination against anyone based on their \"religion or their sexuality or their nationality\". He said the new laws were to protect children.</p><p>\"We are all grown up and every adult has his or her right to understand their sexual activity. Please, do not touch kids. That's the only thing. That's prohibited by law in all countries whether you are gay or straight.\"</p><p>Kozak also appeared to highlight an apparent inconsistency between the IOC and the Russian organisers over the issue. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has said athletes should not protest against the issue on the medal podium but are free to speak out in press conferences.</p><p>But Kozak said: \"Political propaganda is prohibited during the sporting event.

No extra money for building new flood defences in future was announced. </p><p>The communities secretary told MPs the weather had been “savage” and paid tribute to “the work of councils, the staff on the ground from the Environment Agency and the emergency services - they have literally gone through hell and high water.” </p><p>Pickles, who noted existing flood defences had protected 1.2m homes, added: “It is evident that flood defences had taken a real pounding. There will be an urgent review of how to restore and maintain flood defences in target condition.” He said a long-term strategy for flood protection running to 2021 would be delivered by the autumn.</p><p>Pickles criticised the Environment Agency chairman, Lord Smith, who had suggested there was a choice between protecting “front rooms or farmland”, with Pickles saying lessons would be learned from recent problems including “the local accountability of quangos”.</p><p>Shadow environment secretary, Maria Eagle, said: “The government was caught out by the floods and it took far too long for ministers to realised the seriousness of the situation. There have been 21 meeting of [emergency committee] Cobra but it is far from clear what all the talk has achieved.” She also accused ministers of “fiddling the figures” over flood defence spending, after Pickles used a different baseline from that of Cameron on Wednesday. Annual flood defence spending fell by 15% under the coalition.</p><p>Pickles, who was standing in for the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, who is having emergency eye surgery, also confirmed changes to the Bellwin scheme, through which councils can claim funding for damage repairs. They will be able to claim 100% of losses over a threshold, not 85%, and will have to the end of March to claim.  </p><p>On the severing of the mainline London-Penzance railway after a sea wall collapsed at Dawlish, Pickles said: “We are not in a position to know how long it will take [to repair].”</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52f38567e4b0d5e31a93fefe\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-06T12:59:03.559Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Steven Morris has been talking to more victims of the floods on the Somerset Levels, including John Field from Moorland. <br></p><p>He said a decision by Somerset police to use a megaphone from a helicopter to urge people to flee their homes created \"pandemonium.\" Field said \"it just frightened people.\" <br></p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6BHgRhmvaA\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6BHgRhmvaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>Steven also uploaded this brief clip of the water scene in the village. <br></p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2VO1rVs20M\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2VO1rVs20M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52f3827ce4b0d5e31a93fefa\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-06T12:39:26.479Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe9cb17d-c3be-44d6-a256-7e17cac40dbd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391690358617/a16d4ff6-31f6-41dc-91dc-f003e511625d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A giant wave totally engulfes a coastal pub at Chesil Beach in Dorset\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A giant wave totally engulfes a coastal pub at Chesil Beach in Dorset.

I want to put on the record my utmost sympathy for those affected.<p>Flooding has devastating effects on communities. <br></p>I can announce that the government will provide an additional £130 million for emergency repairs and maintenance: £30 million in the current year and £100 million next year. This will cover costs incurred during the current emergency response and recovery, as well as essential repairs to ensure that defences are maintained.<br><br><p>The full picture of the damage caused to flood defences has not yet emerged and the weather continues to be savage. The government will therefore carry out a rapid review of the additional work needed to restore our flood defences and maintain them in target condition.</p><p>In addition, I am publishing before the House today details of how my department is enhancing the terms of the Bellwin scheme ...<br></p><p>The additional funding that we have outlined today will allow the government’s programme of capital investment to continue, fulfilling our commitment to improving defences throughout England.</p><p>We have already put in place investment plans to improve the protection to at least 465,000 households by the end of the decade.</p><p>But, in addition, we are today announcing 42 new flood defence schemes for 2014 to 2015.</p><p>Together with other projects beginning construction in 2014-15, this will protect more than 42,000 households.</p><p>This includes schemes in:</p><ul><li>Salford which will improve protection for more than 2,000 homes and businesses</li><li>Clacton where more than 3,000 homes are currently at risk</li><li>Willerby in the East Riding of Yorkshire where more than 8,000 properties will be better protected</li></ul><p>There are also smaller, but no less important, schemes in Lincoln, Stockton and Todmorden.</p><p>We will work to defend both town and country. For the record, I do not agree with the comments of Lord Smith who implied there is a choice between the two.</p><p>Looking further forward, we have made an unprecedented long-term 6-year commitment to record levels of capital investment in improving defences:</p><ul><li>£370 million in 2015 to 2016</li><li>and then the same in real terms each year</li><li>rising to over £400 million by the end of this decade</li></ul>After the dark skies clear, there will be lessons to learn:<ul><li>from the way we help local authorities</li><li>to the role of quangos and the need for local accountability</li><li>to the influence of man-made policies on dredging and tree planting on our landscape and rivers</li><li>to the resilience of our nation as a whole in the 21st century</li></ul><p>The measures that the Coalition Government has announced today provides an clear commitment to reduce the risks of flooding and coastal erosion.</p><p>The additional funding means that, over this Parliament, this government will be investing more than £3.1 billion, compared to £2.7 billion in the previous 5 years under the last government.</p><p>This is more than ever before, and we will spend it well and spend it wisely.</p><p>We cannot control the weather.

But I am acutely conscious of the need to develop a long term solution to the resilience of the railway network in the south-west, and I have asked for a report on the options for addressing this problems. <br></p></blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-badbf302-c1e8-4ad9-aa15-9a1dc6f7b862\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391681949624/d9729a13-ed16-4101-9d76-6f742bfdf048-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin arrives at a Cobra meeting at the Cabinet Office in London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin arrives at a Cobra meeting at the Cabinet Office in London.

There needs to be a consistent approach across schools, within the high-risk areas as a starting point, and that is not happening.\"</p><p>The Guardian's campaign to help end FGM – which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/05/british-girl-guardian-campaign-end-female-genital-mutilation-fgm\" title=\"\">calls on the education secretary, Michael Gove</a>, to write to every headteacher in the country to inform their staff and parents about FGM – has become the fastest growing health campaign to be hosted on the website Change.org, after launching on Wednesday.</p><p>By mid-morning on Thursday – the UN's FGM zero tolerance day – the <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-schools-to-teach-risks-of-female-genital-mutilation-before-the-summer-endfgm\" title=\"\">petition had more than 30,000 signatures</a> and was gathering the momentum to spark political movement. In comparison Caroline Criado-Perez's successful campaign to keep a women on a Bank of England banknote gained 35,000 signatures. Another 140 a minute – more than two a second – were signing the FGM petition. \"The Guardian campaign is absolutely flying. The numbers are off the scale,\" said John Coventry, from Change.org. \"The people who are signing this campaign are obviously very committed and they want to see action.\"</p><p>Niven called for fresh intelligence on people operating as cutters as he revealed that the lack of victims coming forward to police with information about the abuse they had suffered was a major obstacle to bringing a prosecution. Many young women, he said, were extremely reluctant to provide information that could lead to the prosecution of their parents or other relatives.</p><p>\"I do understand why young girls who have been subjected to this may be reticent about coming forward and giving evidence,\" he said. \"We embrace anyone that wants to come forward and talk to the police and we will support them – we have got the resources and the officers trained to deal with this. But we are not getting the cases coming through.\"</p><p>FGM has been illegal in England and Wales since 1985, with the law amended in 2003 to criminalise the taking of young girls abroad for the practice. More than 66,000 women in England and Wales have undergone FGM and more than 24,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/24/female-genital-mutilation-prevalence-uk\" title=\"\">according to a recent report</a>.</p><p>But since 2009 the Metropolitan police has had only 195 referrals about FGM, most of which involved tiny snippets of information or suspicion, rather than direct contact from victims, and there have been no prosecutions in connection with FGM. \"I want people who have information about the cutters to come forward,\" he said. \"I can use tried and tested methods and tactics and resources to take a close look at them and gather evidence against individuals so I don't need to rely upon victims coming forward.</p><p>\"That is the position I want to get to. But to get there I need a starting point, I need information, I need people to tell me who it is that is committing these crimes.</p><p>\"They know that they are breaking the law, and it is done for financial gain, and we need that extra piece of information to pursue them. I want to take the pressure off the victims and look at potentially what would be a victimless prosecution. That would send a really strong message.\"</p><p>In an attempt to address the reluctance of victims to contact the police, Niven has brought in the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) to act as a neutral intermediary for victims to contact via a 24-hour helpline (0800 028 3550).</p><p>The strongest chance of a criminal case going to trial fell away last year when the alleged victim, who had been subjected to FGM in Kenya in 2006, told detectives she could no longer support the prosecution. The authorities could have forced her to give evidence, but police and prosecutors rejected the idea, as they did not want to put such a vulnerable witness through the ordeal.</p><p>Niven has hopes that with the right weight of evidence, he could pursue a victimless prosecution against cutters in this country. Police are under pressure as the home affairs select committee prepares to mount an inquiry into the failure to prosecute anyone for FGM.</p><p>The<a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/\" title=\"\"> World Health Organisation describes FGM</a> as \"procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\". It is usually carried out on girls between infancy and 15, with the majority of cases taking place between the ages of five and eight.</p><p>Many young girls are taken out of the country during the summer holidays for the practice to be performed abroad, and Niven believes schools could do more to protect them.</p><p>He told the Guardian he had repeatedly called for a high-profile public health campaign targeted at young girls at risk, to be used from primary upwards, but was still waiting for educators to act.</p><p>\"I would like to get a DVD put into the social education classes of all schools in the at-risk areas which explores what FGM is, contains the NSPCC helpline and gives people some support and options about how they can disclose what has happened,\" he said. \"That is my vision. I have raised it in all areas I can, at very high levels, but it has not happened.\"</p><p>The government says teachers have a key role in spotting children who may be at risk of or who have undergone genital cutting, and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/ofsted-to-quiz-heads-on-efforts-to-stop-female-genital-mutilation-8449396.html\" title=\"\">last year Ofsted said it would be testing the alertness of schools to FGM as part of its inspection regime</a>.</p><p>But an <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/news-and-views/media-centre/press-releases/2013/female-genital-mutilation/NSPCC-warning-teachers-on-FGM_wdn94822.html\" title=\"\">NSPCC report revealed shocking levels of ignorance among teachers in England and Wales, with 83% saying they had not had child protection training in this area.</a> The poll of 1,000 teachers also suggested that 68% were unaware of government guidance about safeguarding policies regarding FGM, with one in six teachers saying they did not know that it was illegal in the UK. The same proportion did not see it as child abuse.</p><p>The chance of a prosecution in the near future rests upon eight cases being considered by the CPS. The police are also investigating a London-based doctor, Sureshkumar Pandya, who is alleged to have performed a labia reduction on a patient in March 2012. He was reported to the General Medical Council after the patient was examined by another doctor.</p><p>Instances of FGM in the UK tend to occur in areas with large populations of FGM-practising communities, including from parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East; these areas include London, Cardiff, Manchester, Sheffield, Northampton, Birmingham, Oxford, Crawley, Reading, Slough and Milton Keynes.</p><p>A spokesman for the DfE, responding to Niven's comments, said: \"Female genital mutilation is unacceptable; it is child abuse and a criminal offence. The government's new action plan for tackling violence against women and girls has a renewed focus on protecting potential victims and sends a strong message that FGM will not be tolerated.</p><p>\"Schools play an important role in raising pupils' awareness of this issue. We expect them to refer cases of concern to the relevant agencies in the same way as they would for any type of abuse.\"</p><p></p><p>Anyone who is worried that a child may be or has been a victim of FGM can contact 0800 028 3550 for information and support.</p>","headline":"Police target 'cutters' in campaign against UK female genital mutilation","trailText":"Senior Met officer appeals for

train builder beats Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-06T09:50:42Z","body":"<p>Bombardier UK has fought off competition from foreign bidders to win the £1bn contract to build trains for London's Crossrail project.</p><p>Britain's only train builder, based in Derby, beat Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line. Bombardier – the British arm of the Canadian aerospace and transport manufacturer – had warned that missing out on the contract could cause the factory, which employs 1,500 workers, to close.</p><p>The deal, which also includes building a new depot, will support 760 UK manufacturing jobs and 80 apprenticeships. It will keep an estimated 74% of the contract spend in the UK.</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport announced the politically charged decision on Thursday morning.</p><p>Bombardier missed out on the UK's last big train contract to build rolling stock for the upgrade to London's Thameslink network. The £1.6bn commission went to Germany's Siemens in 2011, prompting Bombardier to cut 1,200 jobs at its plant.</p><p>Following the uproar over the Thameslink contract, the government pledged to put British manufacturers on an \"equal footing\" with overseas competition but ministers remained constrained by European Union rules.</p><p>Andrew Wolstenholme, chief executive of Crossrail, said: \"Crossrail will transform rail services in London and the south-east. Procurement of the rolling stock and depot is just one more step in delivering this new railway and making it a reality for millions of passengers.</p><p>\"Crossrail Limited has conducted this procurement in a fair, objective and transparent manner and in full compliance with the regulatory framework.\"</p><p>If the contract had gone to a foreign bidder it would have been a severe embarrassment to the government and its efforts to encourage manufacturing. George Osborne declared a \"march of the makers\" in 2011 that was undermined by Siemens winning the Thameslink contract.</p><p>The £15bn Crossrail project will connect London's suburbs to the east and west, running through the centre of the city to increase rail capacity by 10%. London's already overcrowded transport system is set to face further demands as the population grows by an expected 1.6 million to 10 million over the next 15 years.</p><p>Bombardier has promised that at least 25% of the value of the contract will go to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Business secretary Vince Cable has consistently called for more support for SMEs, which make up more than half the UK economy.</p><p>TfL will start running the new trains from May 2017 on the existing rail network ahead of services starting on Crossrail's central section in December 2018.</p><p>Cable said: \"As well as providing a great boost to Bombardier and the Midlands this decision represents a real vote of confidence in British manufacturing. The government has been working hard with industry to support the UK rail supply chain to maximise growth opportunities through contracts like this. Our industrial strategy is giving business the confidence to invest – securing high-skilled jobs and a stronger economy.\"</p>","headline":"Bombardier UK wins £1bn Crossrail contract","trailText":"Derby-based train builder beats Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3v","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","wordcount":"473","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429037808","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652056","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sean Farrell","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039094","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T08:28:07Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","tags":[{"id":"business/bombardier","webTitle":"Bombardier","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bombardier","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bombardier","references":[]},{"id":"business/manufacturing-sector","webTitle":"Manufacturing sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/manufacturing-sector","references":[]},{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/transport","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/crossrail","webTitle":"Crossrail","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/crossrail","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/derby","webTitle":"Derby","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/derby","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429038409","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674920650/Bombadier-factory-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Christopher Furlong","altText":"Bombadier factory","height":"54","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","caption":"Bombadier had warned that failure to win the Crossrail contract could mean the closure of the Derby factory and the loss of up to 1,500 jobs.

Laws said Gove should follow cabinet guidelines and allow Sir David Normington, the Public Appointments Commissioner, to appoint the panel chair.</p><p>In a move that will upset Gove and his allies, Laws called for an extension of the law to allow for inspector of academy \"chains\" – the non-profit making bodies that run academies. Ofsted can currently inspect individual academies. But it cannot inspect \"chains\" such as the School Partnership Trust Academies (SPTA) and the Elliot Foundation (TEF).</p><p>Tory sources say that Gove sacked Morgan because he wanted to put \"ideological backbone\" into the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw. Tories believe Wilshaw is following the orthodoxy of established inspectors and focusing harshly on new academies and free schools.</p><p>Laws told the Independent of his new plans for inspections of academy \"chains\", which will probably be included in the Lib Dem general election manifesto. He said: \"When the academies programme started, it had a lot of enemies and was regarded as a precious flower that needed protection. But this flower has now grown strong enough to survive in the full heat of the sun. There are some really good local authorities and there are still some terrible ones. In the same way, there are some good academy groups doing an absolutely fantastic job – like Ark and Harris – and some not doing so well.</p><p>\"Ofsted must be able to shine a spotlight wherever it wants to. I don't want there are to be any constraints. It ought to be able to inspect the chains.\"</p><p>Laws made clear his dismay at the removal of Morgan. He said: \"I don't think it is one of the best decisions that Michael Gove has ever made. I personally think that Sally Morgan has done a fantastic job as chair of Ofsted. I would rather she had remained and had her term renewed.\"</p>","headline":"Ofsted needs power to inspect groups that run academies, says David Laws","trailText":"Coalition rift emerges as education

Asked by Vatican Radio why he thought the findings had been so harsh, he said he suspected pro-gay rights NGOs had influenced the committee and \"reinforced an ideological line\" in the UN.</p><p>Advocates for the survivors of clerical sex abuse welcomed the committee's findings. \"This day has been a long time coming, but the international community is finally holding the Vatican accountable for its role in enabling and perpetuating sexual violence in the church,\" said Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the US-based Centre for Constitutional Rights.</p><p>\"The whole world will be watching to ensure that the Vatican takes the concrete steps required by the UN to protect children and end these crimes.\"</p><p>Pope Francis has referred to clerical child sex abuse as \"the shame of the church\", yet has not often spoken out about it, preferring to focus on other issues such as poverty and the evils of the global financial system. In December he announced the establishment of a commission of experts to look at how the church could better protect children from potential abusers.</p><p>When they appeared in Geneva last month, Tomasi and Charles Scicluna, a former sex crimes prosecutor at the Vatican and auxiliary bishop of Malta, said guidelines already put in place by the Holy See and Catholic churches around the world had, when properly applied, presented a way of eliminating the scourge of abuse. \"The Holy See gets it,\" Scicluna declared.</p><p>But, according to the UN committee, that is yet to be proved. \"The committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators,\" it wrote in its first concluding observations on the Holy See – a signatory to the UN convention on the rights of the child – since 1995.</p><p>Dismissing a key plank of the Holy See's argument – that the church is not comparable to a global business and the Vatican cannot be expected to keep in check all clergy in all parts of the world – the committee said that by ratifying the convention it had committed itself to implementing it \"not only on the territory of the Vatican City state but also as the supreme power of the Catholic church through individuals and institutions placed under its authority\".</p><p>Attacking what it described as a \"code of silence\" that had restricted the reporting of suspected crimes, the committee criticised the practice of moving priests found to have abused children from parish to parish or to other countries \"in an attempt to cover up such crimes\".</p><p>The committee noted: \"The practice of offenders' mobility, which has allowed many priests to remain in contact with children and to continue to abuse them, still places children in many countries at high risk of sexual abuse, as dozens of child sexual offenders are reported to be still in contact with children.\"</p><p>Last month Scicluna told the panel that this was \"a grave concern\", but said dioceses and parishes were now obliged to pass on information concerning a priest wanting to move on. He also said: \"It is not a policy of the Holy See to encourage cover-ups.\"</p><p>The UN panel also criticised the Holy See for refusing to hand over data concerning all cases of abuse brought to its attention during the period in question, and their outcomes. It said confidential disciplinary proceedings had \"allowed the vast majority of abusers and almost all those who concealed child sexual abuse to escape judicial proceedings in states where abuses were committed\".</p><p>The findings were not limited to clerical abuse, exploring other areas – from the classification of \"illegitimate\" children to the use of so-called baby boxes – where it said the Catholic church could improve its protection of children's rights.</p><p>It was particularly critical of the Vatican's handling of Ireland's Magdalene Laundries scandal, in which thousands of women and girls were abused and enslaved, saying a full Vatican investigation should be launched and the abusers prosecuted. It demanded full compensation be paid to the victims and their families who were caught up in the system in Ireland.</p><p>Last year the Irish state finally said sorry to 10,000 women and girls incarcerated in Catholic church-run laundries, where they were treated as virtual slaves. The taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said what happened to the Magdalene women had \"cast a long shadow over Irish life, over our sense of who we are\", and he \"deeply regretted and apologised\" for the hurt and trauma inflicted.</p><h2> Clerical sex abuse: the UN's recommendations</h2><p>• All known and suspected child abusers must be immediately removed from their positions and the relevant civil law enforcement authorities notified. This reporting to civil authorities must be mandatory; clear rules and procedures should be set up to facilitate it; and all church employees must be taught that these obligations prevail over church law.</p><p>• Pope Francis's commission should investigate independently all cases of abuse and \"the conduct of the Catholic hierarchy in dealing with them\". It should consider appointing representatives of civil society and victims groups.</p><p>• Archives of past cases dealt with by the Holy See must be opened to allow for both the abusers and those who may have sought to conceal their crimes and \"knowingly placed offenders in contact with children\" to be held accountable.</p><p>The committee's findings are non-binding.

Baillon said he had feared the pensioner's car could drag him along the road.</p><p>A 17-minute pursuit followed through country roads, which was caught by a video camera inside the police car.</p><p>Whatley then pulled over and Baillon said he did not try to open the vehicle's door because its locking system may have made that impossible.</p><p>Instead, as seen in a video that went viral, he took a metal baton and repeatedly struck the side window of the pensioner's vehicle. He did so until it had smashed enough for the officer to get his arm in, grab the keys and immobilise the vehicle.</p><p>Baillon said he struck the side window of the pensioner's car no more than eight times, and was worried Whatley might have tried to drive off again and injure him or a colleague.</p><p>Baillon said when he had smashed the window and had control of the car, he said to Whatley: \"Calm down; it's over.\"</p><p>He said he then walked away, as shown in the video, to de-escalate the situation and let other colleagues deal with the pensioner.</p><p>Baillon said: \"I was completely in control of my actions.\"</p><p>He said he had used a \"conflict management\" model taught to officers, which saw him display an \"explosion of force\" to gain control. Baillon said a subsequent inquiry found his actions and adherence to his training was \"expertly\" carried out.</p><p>Baillon said: \"It wasn't temper, it was a strong use of force, that was required to get into the vehicle, to disable the vehicle, to stop it going any further.\"</p><p>Baillon said he accepted the video \"looks terrible in isolation\" but police work can sometimes look ugly: \"There are occasions when it looks terrible but its for the right reasons.\"</p><p>Baillon said despite internal investigations exonerating him, senior officers at Gwent police undermined him and failed to publicly back him.</p><p>He said the stress caused his wife to suffer a miscarriage and that at one point he even received a death threat.</p><p>Baillon said it was his force's failure to back him that left him feeling undermined, not jokes from colleagues about the clash with the pensioner, saying: \"It is not the case I threw my teddy out the pram because people were making jokes.\"</p><p>He added: \"I simply wanted them to acknowledge the impact it had on me and my family.\"</p><p>Baillon said when the video was leaked in 2011, it put great stress on him and his family.</p><p>He complained to his superiors but they did nothing to help him. Baillon claims that after his complaints he was moved from the traffic job he loved</p><p>\"After everything I had gone through, it was completely unfair for the organisation to move me,\" he said.</p><p>Baillon said the tribunal payments of £430,000 for the part of the pension he lost, plus £10,000 for lost wages, was fair.</p><p>Whatley received £20,000 from police for the damage to his car.

His colleagues in the armed forces' governing council <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">mandated</a> him to run last Monday – and his popularity is so high among certain sections of the population that he is expected to win by a landslide.</p><p>But throughout all the hype, Sisi had not publicly confirmed his candidacy. That appeared to change in the early hours of Thursday morning, when Kuwaiti newspaper al-Seyasia published what they said was an interview with the man himself.</p><p>In the article, Sisi was quoted appealing to Egyptians for patience amid worsening economic and social conditions.</p><p>\"I shall not refuse the request of the people of my country, but I will ask them to help,\" he reportedly said. \"Egypt is ill, very ill. It's been getting worse in the last few years. People realise that it's a heavy burden and it requires everybody's cooperation to carry it. Therefore, we have to share this load and work to heal our country from its illness.\"</p><p>An army spokesman later claimed that the interview was inaccurate. He said Sisi had not yet declared his intentions, and would only do so in an Egyptian context, \"in front of the sons of the great Egyptian people, in clear and direct words, leaving no room for doubt or interpretation\".</p><p></p><p>Analysts consistently warn that while Sisi currently has the backing of many sections of society, the electorate has proved fickle in the recent past. They say Sisi  risks losing popularity very quickly if he does not find prompt solutions to Egypt's many social problems.</p><p>Public sentiment is hard to quantify in Egypt. Over 98% of participants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/18/egypt-constitution-yes-vote-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">voted</a> for Egypt's new constitution this month, a sign of strong support for Sisi.</p><p>But only 38.6% of those eligible to vote took part – a respectable figure in comparison with past votes, but lower than Sisi might have hoped.</p><p>For their part, Morsi supporters detest the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">field marshal</a> for presiding over a campaign of oppression that has seen more than a thousand Morsi supporters killed, and thousands arrested.

Of those, 505 were men. <br></p><p>Basso was the first female inmate executed in the US since Kimberly McCarthy was put to death in Texas last June. Only four women have been executed nationwide since 2002 - three in Texas, which accounts for more than a third of the total number of prisoners executed in the US.</p><p>Basso declined to make a final statement and was pronounced dead at 6.26pm local time, eleven minutes after the lethal dose of pentobarbital was administered, Associated Press reported. <br></p><p>Basso's lawyer, Winston Cochran, asked the Supreme Court to review Texas's criteria for assessing the mental health of prisoners sentenced to death. <br></p><p>In earlier appeals to state and federal courts, Cochran argued that Basso was delusional and did not meet the standard of mental competency required for an execution to proceed.</p><p>However, last month a judge in Houston ruled that Basso was competent enough to be executed. Cochran also contended that she had not received a fair trial. He said that no mitigating evidence was presented, the testimony of a medical examiner was questionable and no testimony or evidence showed that she personally killed Musso or proves exactly how he died.</p><p>Originally from New York, Basso was found guilty of the 1998 murder of 59-year-old Louis \"Buddy\" Musso.</p><p>According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, she lured the mentally-disabled man from New Jersey to Texas under the pretence that she would marry him. But she the ringleader of a group who tortured and killed him by kicking and beating him with belts, baseball bats and steel-toed boots. He was found by a road in a Houston suburb with extensive injuries.</p><p>Basso's five co-defendants, including her son, were convicted of involvement in Musso's killing but not sentenced to death. At the trial in 1999 it was suggested that Basso hoped to cash in on his life insurance payout.</p><p>Women account for about 10% of murder arrests but only represent 2.1% of death sentences imposed at trial and less than 1% of completed executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. <br></p><p>There are now eight women on Texas' death row, including Linda Carty, a British citizen born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.</p>","headline":"Texas killer Suzanne Basso becomes 14th woman executed in US since 1976","trailText":"Suzanne Basso's last-minute appeal that she was 'mentally delusional' fails and she iskilled by lethal injection<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgxa","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391654150490/a62d5db4-8193-4bb9-84f3-d500edeeb2f7-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391654150490/a62d5db4-8193-4bb9-84f3-d500edeeb2f7-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"431","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429026098","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2f282e4b0530e249db035","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Dart in Houston","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039050","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:45:15+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-killer-basso-woman-executed-us-death-penalty","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-killer-basso-woman-executed-us-death-penalty","tags":[{"id":"world/texas","webTitle":"Texas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/texas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/texas","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","references":[]},{"id":"world/capital-punishment","webTitle":"Capital punishment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/capital-punishment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/capital-punishment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-dart","webTitle":"Tom Dart","r2ContributorId":"50797","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/9/1336571916728/Tom-Dart-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Dart is a Houston-based freelance journalist.

He said the company was “doubling down on accelerating growth in our core user base” in 2014. Twitter has “massive global awareness” he said but needed to make it easier for new people to “get it”.</p><p>Costolo said changes to Twitter’s products had already made significant differences, increasing the numbers of retweets and favourites. “We believe combined changes over the course of the year will start to change the slope of the user growth curve,” he said. He said the company had a clear “roadmap” for growing user numbers. “I’m delighted with the early results,” he said.</p><p>Twitter went public last November and while its share price has soared, it has attracted some unusually negative coverage. Shares sold at $26 a share during the initial public offering and have traded as high as $74.73. They closed Wednesday at $66.21, before the earnings report was published.  In after-hours trading, the stock fell by as much as 17%,</p><p>Before the results were issued, 30% of the analysts following Twitter had posted sell ratings on the company’s stock, while 27% listed it as buys and 43% were neutral, according to analyst FactSet. By comparison, 89% of analysts following Facebook are recommending a buy and none are posting sell ratings. Sell notes account for just 6% of all the analyst recommendations covering the S&amp;P 500 list of the top US companies.<br></p><p>Analysts are concerned that Twitter’s growth is slowing and that while Twitter’s revenue is more than doubling each quarter, it has yet to make a profit. Shyam Patil, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said for many analysts the company’s share price had risen “too far too fast”.</p><p>Patil, who has a neutral rating on the company, said no new information had come out on the company before the quarterly results, and the share price had been driven up by expectations rather than facts. “I think it’s a good business. It is clearly differentiated from the competition,” he said. He said Twitter had yet to figure out how it was going to make money, and that at the moment the sky-high valuation was based on bets that it would hit on a lucrative plan.</p><p>“You could see an incredible house and think it’s worth half a million only to find out it’s being sold for $2m. It’s still a great house,” he said.</p><p>In recent months, Twitter has made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to tweets. The moves are designed to improve “engagement” – a key measure for advertisers who want to see their content favourited, retweeted and commented upon.</p><p>Twitter is still growing quickly. The disappointing quarterly figures still represents a 30% rise year on year. But it accounts for a very small portion of the overall digital ad market. Twitter accounted for 0.5% of global digital ad revenues in 2013, according to eMarketer, up compared to 0.3% in 2012. Facebook, by comparison, accounts for 5.7% of global digital ad spending. Google accounts for 32.4%.</p>","headline":"Twitter posts revenues of $242m but share price plummets as growth stalls","trailText":"Revenue increases 116% to exceed analysts' expectations but company adds just 9m users in final three months of 2013","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfq2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636521400/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636521400/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"827","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429014679","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2ace1e4b0530e249db005","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dominic Rushe in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038988","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T16:45:59-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/05/twitter-revenues-share-price-drops","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/feb/05/twitter-revenues-share-price-drops","tags":[{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/social-media","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e1cb786f-5ac1-4b52-9bbb-09e5c44ada0c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636520850/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636520850/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Justin Sullivan","altText":"Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.","height":"132","credit":"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","caption":"Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.
