from Pakistan alleges she was often raped while kept as virtual slave for almost a decade by Salford couple","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-06-18T22:01:35Z","body":"<p>A profoundly deaf and mute woman told a court how she was kept in a cellar and made to sleep on the floor during almost 10 years as a virtual slave.</p><p>The orphaned youngster from Pakistan, now aged between 19 and 21, claims she was locked in a cellar each night and forced to cook and clean for the Ashar family and their friends for no pay, Minshull Street crown court in Manchester was told. Ilyas Ashar, 83, and his wife, Tallat, 66, deny false imprisonment, human trafficking, sexual offences, violence and benefit fraud. They are accused of abusing the woman at their home in Salford, after bringing her from Pakistan in June 2000.</p><p>The trial, now in its third week, has heard claims that the victim was beaten, repeatedly raped by Ilyas Ashar, and kept to work for the family – never having gone to school and taught only to sign her name for the purposes of a benefits scam.</p><p>On Monday, she gave evidence for the first time via a video-link to the courtroom, signing her answers to questions.She said she had \"no friends\" when living with the Ashar family and was not allowed to go to college. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, asked her about her life now.</p><p>Her reply, through the translator, was: \"Love going out for walk in the fresh air. Love going to the fair and enjoy lots of different things. Also enjoy going to the college by myself on the bus. The third thing I love to do is going out, going around but having nothing to do with men. Sexually having nothing to do with men.\"</p><p>The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is thought to have been between 10 and 12 when she came to the UK. Shown photos of the cellar, she pointed out a camp-bed where she said she slept and a radiator she used to keep warm.

She said she was then told to sit on top of him as he sat on the toilet seat, and he raped her.<P>She said she was then interrupted by one of the men who said: \"We are ready to go now. Let's leave these bitches now. Come on, let's do it.\"<P>Mr Latham asked: \"What did 'let's do it' mean?\"<P>She replied: \"I didn't know exactly what they were going to do but I assumed it would be the final stage, that we were going to die, that they were going to kill us.\"<P>After another forced shower, she and Mary-Ann were led out to a car.<P>Mr Latham asked: \"How did you feel in the light of what had been said to you as you were going from the room to the car?\"<P>She said: \"Scared.\"<P>Mr Latham: \"Because you knew what was going to happen to you?\"<P>The witness then put her hand to her head and started to cry.<P>Joshua Morally, 23, and his brother, Jamaile, 22, both of Balham, south London; Indrit Krasniqui, 18, of Chiswick, west London; Llewellyn Adams, 24, of Balham; Michael Johnson, 19, of Southfields, south-west London, and Adrian Thomas, 20 of Battersea, south London all deny murder, attempted murder, rape and causing grievous bodily harm to the two teenagers.<P>All deny kidnap, except Joshua Morally, who admits two counts of kidnap. Jamaile Morally denies a further charge of raping Mary-Ann's friend.<P>Friends and family wept and left the court as the teenager went on to describe how she watched as Mary-Ann was stabbed in front of her pleading for mercy. First describing how they were taken out of the hotel room and back to the car boot, the girl said she believed there were \"more than two\" voices in the car as they drove to the park.<P>She said the men seemed \"calm\" during the journey, which ended when they arrived in the park just as dawn was beginning to break. The teenager said Mary-Ann had been \"terrified\" as they stepped out of the car and that she was also afraid but trying not to show it.<P>She said the two of them were then marched on to grass and she had tried to wipe the blood from her eye. She said they were then told to kneel, touching the side of the witness box to indicate how close the two girls were at the time.<P>The witness said pillowcases were placed over their heads and she remembered wiping the blood from her eye with the pillowcase as the men \"talked quietly to each other\". Recalling that she heard Mary-Ann being out of breath, the witness told the jury she lifted up the pillowcase to \"peek at first\" at what was going on and later lifted it completely.<P>Asked by Mr Latham what happened next she paused for around 30 seconds before looking straight ahead at the jury and saying \"she was stabbed\".<P>The court was told the knifeman wore a bandana. Asked where on Mary-Ann's body the man had put the knife, the witness said: \"Her upper body, her chest, her breasts, everything.\"<P>Mr Latham asked: \"Was she saying anything?\"<P>The witness said: \"She was asking 'please not there, please not there' whatever area she was referring to, and crying and pleading.\"<P>She said that Mary-Ann then fell in a ball on the ground but the stabbing did not stop.<P>\"He got more angry because she wouldn't sit up, he was telling her to sit up because he wanted to slit her throat, that was when she was saying 'not there, not there' and he was stabbing and then she fell.\"<P>She went on to say that the man with the bandana had said to the other man that he wanted to shoot Mary-Ann because \"she wouldn't shut up\". She said the man did not go on to shoot Mary-Ann and that she heard one man say: \"'No, that's for her,' meaning me.\"<P>The woman told the court that the gun was put to her head and she was asked whether she was ready to die. She said an attacker then told her: \"Those are going to be your last moments, seeing your friend being butchered.\"<P>The court heard she was then shot and unconscious for an uncertain period of time, \"possibly minutes\", but when she woke up she could still hear Mary-Ann breathing. Worried the attackers might not have gone far away, the woman made her way towards Tilehurst Road where she was able to summon help.<P>She went on to describe to the jury how, 10 days later, she identified her attackers through photos provided by the police, picking out Mr Johnson as the man who had worn a bandana and adding: \"He killed Mary-Ann.\"<P>The trial continues.","headline":"Shooting survivor tells of torture ordeal","trailText":"The friend who was with Mary-Ann Leneghan on the night she was killed broke down in court today as she described being told she was also about to die.

face criminal charges, prosecutors have announced.</p><p>Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife, Tracey, 43, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after a legally-owned shotgun was fired during a break-in at their home in Welby, Leicestershire, in the early hours of Sunday.</p><p>The Ferries were released on police bail as police announced that two men had been charged with burgling the property near Melton Mowbray.</p><p>In a statement released by the Crown Prosecution Service, Judith Walker, the chief crown prosecutor for the East Midlands, said: \"Looking at the evidence, it is clear to me that Mr and Mrs Ferrie did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves, and their home, from intruders.\"</p><p>Ms Walker said: \"Earlier this afternoon, the head of the East Midlands Complex Casework Unit, Lawrence English, visited the scene of the incident to see for himself whether the accounts given by Mr and Mrs Ferrie were consistent with other evidence of what happened.</p><p>\"I am satisfied that this is a case where householders, faced with intruders in frightening circumstances, acted in reasonable self-defence.</p><p>\"The law is clear that anyone who acts in good faith, using reasonable force, doing what they honestly feel is necessary to protect themselves, their families or their property, will not be prosecuted for such action.\"</p><p>Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, pleaded guilty to burglary at Loughborough magistrates' court on Wednesday and will be sentenced at Leicester crown court on 25 September.</p><p>Joshua O'Gorman, 27, who is also charged with the burglary, did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on 14 September.</p><p>The court heard the Ferries had been woken in the night by the sound of banging and breaking glass.</p><p>Sally Cook, prosecuting, said: \"It is no secret that a shotgun was fired at the property.\"</p><p>She said Mansell, who appeared to have his arm in a sling, had been injured inside the property and was arrested later at hospital in Leicester.</p><p>The arrest of the Ferries after the incident at their isolated cottage has reopened the long-running debate about the rights of householders.</p><p>Rutland and Melton MP, Alan Duncan, said the real crime would be if the couple were prosecuted for defending their home.</p><p>On hearing the news that the

He then hit her so hard with her marble rolling pin that it shattered into three pieces, the prosecution alleged.</p><p>Later, Hamlen, a 33-year-old electrician, went to a cash machine and attempted to draw money out with a credit card stolen from Mrs Edmonds, it was claimed.</p><p>Mrs Edmonds's son, Harry, found his mother, who suffered from osteoporosis, lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen of her home in the Hampshire village of Brambridge, near Eastleigh.</p><p>When police interviewed Hamlen, he said he had a £100-a-week cocaine habit. He was under pressure to pay drug debts and may have been threatened with violence.</p><p>Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Winchester crown court that Mrs Edmonds lived in a cottage in the grounds of her son Harry's home.</p><p>On 11 January 2008, Harry came home from work and was alarmed to find his mother's cottage in darkness. \"The whole place seemed dark and still, and he had a feeling that something was just not right,\" said Bowes. \"He saw his mother's legs lying on the floor of the kitchen,\" the barrister said. \"Her upper body and head were behind the door as he pushed it open. Initially he thought she had fallen. He then saw his mother lying flat on her face, completely still, with a very significant pool of blood coming from her head or face.</p><p>\"He saw that her trousers had been pulled down slightly and that on the back of her head there was a significant pinkish dent, as if caused by one huge hit or by several blows in the same place. It was obvious to him that she was dead and that she had been murdered.\"</p><p>Bowes told the jury that Mrs Edmonds had suffered about 30 knife wounds. The prosecution claims a paring knife was used to jab the pensioner, \"part of escalating violence in order to get information out of her\". Each wound was \"very deliberate\", Bowes said. The knife was also dragged across the victim's throat, leaving a deep gash.</p><p>\"The many knife wounds penetrated Georgina Edmonds's skin. Their pattern suggests they had been inflicted with some deliberation rather than a significant degree of force,\" said Bowes. \"Given the theft of her credit card and its unsuccessful use hours later, the inference is she was tortured in order to obtain her pin and then beaten to death.\"</p><p>Bowes claimed Hamlen had walked in through an unlocked back door and made his escape via a towpath near the cottage.</p><p>He said Mrs Edmonds's credit card, mobile phone and handbag were stolen. At 10.38pm on the same day, someone tried unsuccessfully to use her credit card at a cash machine outside Tesco Express in Eastleigh. The person who used the card tried to hide his identity under the hood of a fluorescent jacket. The prosecution alleges this was Hamlen.</p><p>Hamlen told police he walked in the area where the cottage was. He said he might have gone into the grounds of the cottage because he liked old houses and castles and enjoyed \"a nose\".</p><p>\"He could not remember climbing over the five bar gate to the drive but said he did do things like that,\" said Bowes.</p><p>Hamlen told detectives he had a £100-a-week cocaine habit and admitted he had been under pressure to pay back drugs debts and may have been threatened with violence. Police found that Hamlen was nearly £6,000 in debt in January 2008. Bowes said: \"We say the drug habit and debt was highly significant bearing in mind Georgina Edmonds had been tortured for her pin.\"</p><p>Bowes told the jury there was a \"forensic DNA link to Hamlen\" from the rolling pin. Analysis of Hamlen's mobile phone also showed that he was in the area where Mrs Edmonds lived on the day she was killed, the jury heard.</p><p>Hamlen denies murdering Mrs Edmonds.

He had 101 injuries and was covered in deep cuts and bruising. An \"armoury\" of weapons allegedly used to abuse him was found in the flat, the court was told.</p><p>He and four siblings were visiting their sister Magalie Bamu in London from Paris for the Christmas holidays when Bamu and her partner became convinced they were witches, the court heard.</p><p>Kelly described how on Christmas Day, after several days of abuse, Bikubi – who, like Bamu, was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – had dragged Kristy into the bathroom by his clothes, put him in the bath and filled it with \"very cold\" water.</p><p>\"Eric asked Kristy if he wanted to die. Kristy said: 'Yes, I want to die.' That's the last thing I heard from my brother,\" she said.</p><p>Pointing at her sister in the dock she said: \"And she did nothing, she didn't even call the emergency services. I was the one who said call the emergency services.\"</p><p>Bikubi forced Kelly, her brother Yves, a younger sister and another child of the family into the bath with Kristy, who she said was under the water.</p><p>He then doused them in cold water from the shower head and made them chant, she told the court.</p><p>\"Kristy was no longer moving, he was not moving at all,\" she said.</p><p>Indicating Bikubi, she said: \"He says that he was not in his right mind but he was perfectly aware of what he was doing.\"</p><p>Addressing both defendants she shouted: \"You don't know what you've done, you two. Did you ever think of your parents, of Mum and Dad?\"</p><p>On another occasion she shouted: \"You're still breathing, you're still alive … Why have you taken a life?\"</p><p>Earlier Kelly detailed the extent of the abuse her brother had suffered. Shown a metal bar, Kelly told the court that during several days of extreme violence Bikubi had used the bar to hit Kristy about his body and head, and had repeatedly shoved it into his mouth, causing a tooth to dislodge.</p><p>\"Eric shoved it as hard as he could with such force that it broke his tooth,\" she said. \"Eric said: 'Get on your knees, get on your knees.'\"</p><p>Asked if Kristy had voluntarily opened his mouth, she said: \"Kristy had opened his mouth, he said it hurt, but [Eric] didn't care. He did it a number of times. He's sick,\" she said.</p><p>Kelly said that during the violence – which was also directed at her and a sister but focused on Kristy – the siblings were recruited to harm the 15-year-old.</p><p>Kelly was told to get some pliers and twist Kristy's ear, she told the court. \"As if that wasn't enough, all this blood all over the house,\" she said. But Kelly was reprimanded when she did not do enough to hurt her brother. \"I couldn't bring myself to do it, but he said if I didn't do it 'I'm going to do the same thing to you'.\"</p><p>She described her sister Bamu taking over: \"Then Magalie took the pliers and she twisted the ear as hard as she could.\" Turning to her sister in the dock, she said: \"You're an absolute disgrace.\"</p><p>Kelly went on to describe how Bikubi had placed a light bulb in her mouth, held a kitchen knife to her chest and put his hand around her throat, before doing the same thing with Kristy and her sister, who cannot be named for legal reasons. \"He was intending to kill us, all of us,\" she said.</p><p>She also described how bottles were smashed over her brother's head, and Eric headbutted and punched him. \"Eric just went for Kristy,\" she said. \"Kristy was a child, he was 15 years old. His face was completely disfigured. Kristy, he suffered. And Magalie did nothing [to stop it] so both of them are guilty.\"</p><p>She later added that in a moment during the abuse Kristy had been allowed to sleep but Bamu had entered his room and said he was still practising witchcraft. \"So [Eric] got us into the sitting room and it all began again,\" she said.</p><p>She said her brother had been forced to drink urine and the siblings were told to clean up the blood in the flat before his death. \"There was blood everywhere,\" she said.</p><p>As Kelly told the court that tiles were smashed repeatedly over her brother's head, Magalie Bamu began sobbing loudly in the dock. \"Eric took the tiles and then he hit his head again and again. Kristy was already tired by this point and couldn't take any more blows. But that wasn't enough for Eric. He wanted him to die,\" she told the court.</p><p>The tiles had been smashed the day before Kristy was drowned in a bath, she said. She added that the pair had repeatedly phoned their parents in Paris, and when Kristy was close to death Bikubi had told their father, Pierre Bamu, that if the teenager was not collected from the house he would kill him.</p><p>\"Kristy was already on the edge. I could see in his eyes that he was already leaving us. Eric had the cheek to call our father and said: 'If you don't come and pick up Kristy and the children I'm going to kill them,' and that's what he did.\"</p><p>During several calls to the siblings' parents in Paris, Magalie Bamu denied the abuse, said Kelly. \"They told me to say to my mother that I confessed I was a witch. I made it all up and they believed it.\" She added: \"My mother didn't even understand anything I was telling her.\"</p><p>During one conversation, Bikubi was sat next to her on the couch with his fists clenched, she said. Kristy also spoke to his mother but did not tell her about the abuse. \"Those blows, he'd accepted them, and when he was one the phone he didn't even say: 'They have been hitting me, I've been receiving all these blows.'\"</p><p>All three told their mother they had confessed to being witches, she said. \"We all made up these stories because these two were obsessed with it,\" she told the court.</p><p>Bikubi denies murder, but has admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, and has pleaded guilty to two counts of actual bodily harm. Magalie Bamu denies murder and two counts of actual bodily harm. The trial continues.</p>","headline":"Girl tells court 'witchcraft-obsessed' couple tortured and killed her brother","trailText":"Sister of Kristy Bamu, 15, describes events leading up his death, allegedly at the hands of another sister and her partner","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/10/1326220352177/Kristy-Bamu-003.jpg","wordcount":"1132","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"384236210","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5680051","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alexandra Topping","internalPageCode":"1686514","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-01-13T18:58:31Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/girl-court-witchcraft-couple-brother","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/jan/10/girl-court-witchcraft-couple-brother","tags":[{"id":"uk/ukcrime","webTitle":"Crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexandratopping","webTitle":"Alexandra Topping","r2ContributorId":"19530","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/alexandra_topping_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alexandra Topping is a news reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexandratopping","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alexandratopping","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-384236792","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/10/1326220350117/Kristy-Bamu-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Metropolitan Police","altText":"Kristy Bamu","height":"54","credit":"Metropolitan Police/PA","caption":"Kristy Bamu, 15, was found dead in a bath in a blood-covered flat in Forest Gate, London on Christmas Day.
