        "body":"<p>Google has nailed its colours to the mast over Russia's gay rights record in a new Google doodle, which is dedicated to the Olympic charter.</p><p>The internet company's logo was presented in the colours of the rainbow flag and also featured images of Winter Games events. The build-up to the Sochi Games, the opening ceremony of which takes place on Friday, has been disrupted by a debate over the apparent conflict between the central principles of the Games and anti-gay laws in Russia.</p><p>The doodle linked to search results for \"Olympic charter\" and quoted from it: \"The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.\"</p><p>There have been widespread protests over the decision to hold the Games in Russia, which bans providing information on homosexuality to under-18s by law. Gay rights activists in 19 cities across the world spoke out earlier this week.</p><p>And, in a speech to the International Olympic Committee on Thursday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, spoke out against attacks on the LGBT community. He said that \"many professional athletes, gay and straight, are speaking out against prejudice\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429121709|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|fd9797aec010dd769498fc5233ee7c3888b75243 -->",

        "headline":"Russell Brand: Philip Seymour Hoffman is another victim of extremely stupid drug laws",
        "body":"<p>Philip Seymour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/05/phili-seymour-hoffman-autopsy-inconclusive-drugs\" title=\"\">Hoffman's death</a> was not on the bill.</p><p>If it'd been the sacrifice of Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber, that we are invited to anticipate daily, we could delight in the Faustian justice of the righteous dispatch of a fast-living, sequin-spattered denizen of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emptyv\" title=\"\">eMpTyV</a>. We are tacitly instructed to await their demise with necrophilic sanctimony. When the end comes, they screech on Fox and TMZ, it will be deserved. The Mail provokes indignation, luridly baiting us with the sidebar that scrolls from the headline down to hell.</p><p>But Philip Seymour Hoffman? A middle-aged man, a credible and decorated actor, the industrious and unglamorous artisan of Broadway and serious cinema? The disease of addiction recognises none of these distinctions. Whilst routinely described as tragic, Hoffman's death is insufficiently sad to be left un-supplemented in the mandatory posthumous scramble for salacious garnish; we will now be subjected to mourn-ography posing as analysis. I can assure you that there is no as yet undiscovered riddle in his domestic life or sex life, the man was a drug addict and his death inevitable.</p><p>A troubling component of this sad loss is the complete absence of hedonism. Like a lot of drug addicts, probably most, who \"go over\", Hoffman was alone when he died. This is an inescapably bleak circumstance. When we reflect on Bieber's Louis Vuitton embossed, Lamborghini cortege it is easy to equate addiction with indulgence and immorality. The great actor dying alone denies us this required narrative prang.</p><p>The reason I am so non-judgmental of Hoffman or Bieber and so condemnatory of the pop cultural tinsel that adorns the reporting around them is that I am a drug addict in recovery, so like any drug addict I know exactly how Hoffman felt when he \"went back out\". In spite of his life seeming superficially great, in spite of all the praise and accolades, in spite of all the loving friends and family, there is a predominant voice in the mind of an addict that supersedes all reason and that voice wants you dead. This voice is the unrelenting echo of an unfulfillable void.</p><p>Addiction is a mental illness around which there is a great deal of confusion, which is hugely exacerbated by the laws that criminalise drug addicts.</p><p>If drugs are illegal people who use drugs are criminals. We have set our moral compass on this erroneous premise, and we have strayed so far off course that the landscape we now inhabit provides us with no solutions and greatly increases the problem.</p><p>This is an important moment in history; we know that prohibition does not work. We know that the people who devise drug laws are out of touch and have no idea how to reach a solution. Do they even have the inclination? The fact is their methods are so gallingly ineffective that it is difficult not to deduce that they are deliberately creating the worst imaginable circumstances to maximise the harm caused by substance misuse.</p><p>People are going to use drugs; no self-respecting drug addict is even remotely deterred by prohibition. What prohibition achieves is an unregulated, criminal-controlled, sprawling, global mob-economy, where drug users, their families and society at large are all exposed to the worst conceivable version of this regrettably unavoidable problem.</p><p>Countries like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/14/decriminalise-drugs\" title=\"\">Portugal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/01/switzerland-drugs-heroin\" title=\"\">Switzerland</a> that have introduced progressive and tolerant drug laws have seen crime plummet and drug-related deaths significantly reduced. We know this. We know this system doesn't work – and yet we prop it up with ignorance and indifference. Why? Wisdom is acting on knowledge. Now we are aware that our drug laws aren't working and that alternatives are yielding positive results, why are we not acting? Tradition? Prejudice? Extreme stupidity? The answer is all three. Change is hard, apathy is easy, tradition is the narcotic of our rulers. The people who are most severely affected by drug prohibition are dispensable, politically irrelevant people. Poor people. Addiction affects all of us but the poorest pay the biggest price.</p><p>Philip Seymour Hoffman's death is a reminder, though, that addiction is indiscriminate. That it is sad, irrational and hard to understand. What it also clearly demonstrates is that we are a culture that does not know how to treat its addicts. Would Hoffman have died if this disease were not so enmeshed in stigma? If we weren't invited to believe that people who suffer from addiction deserve to suffer? Would he have OD'd if drugs were regulated, controlled and professionally administered? Most importantly, if we insisted as a society that what is required for people who suffer from this condition is an environment of support, tolerance and understanding.</p><p>The troubling message behind Philip Seymour Hoffman's death, which we all feel without articulating, is that it was unnecessary and we know that something could be done.

You may recall that the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Olympics started at precisely 20.08 local time (on the eighth day of the eighth month, for good measure), that the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics started at 20.10 local time, and the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics started at precisely 20.12 local time. This is a worrying trend for residents of future host cities, who just a couple of centuries from now will have to wait until well past 10 o’clock before their ceremonies start, with the final fireworks fading into the night sky at some point the following afternoon. But it could prove problematic sooner than that – will the opening ceremony for the 2062 Winter Olympics start at 9.02pm? How far are we going to go with this?</p><p>So what do we already know about the multisensory extravaganza that we are about to experience?</p><p>• tATu, school-uniform-clad teenaged faux-lesbian popsters of yore, are reuniting for it – but they’re only featuring in the pre-show, so we might not see them on the telly, and word is they won’t be playing their 2003 No1 smash All the Things She Said but their widely-forgotten No7 follow-up Not Gonna Get Us – on the basis that it is thematically “relevant to athletes”. Fellow Russian pop stars Na-Na and Buranovskiye Babushki are also likely to be involved. If you don’t know Buranovskiye Babushki, they are the elderly ethno-warblers who stormed to second place at the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgUstrmJzyc\">their foot-tapping number Party for Everybody</a>. This is really a classic Eurovision entry, and if you haven’t previously enjoyed it, you should enjoy it right now. It’s right here for you. And when you’ve finished, you might want to check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVpEP8FgM7U\">their surprisingly-not-that-unpleasant version of the Beatles’ Let it Be</a>.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgUstrmJzyc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgUstrmJzyc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>• There will be Tchaikovsky. There’s also space for Peter the Great, “a small, perfect ballet show performed by the best ballet dancers of Russia”, Nikolai Gogol (one of the preeminent figures of the natural school of Russian literary realism, I’m told), World War II, Napoleon’s disastrous attempt to take the country – dead horses not included, I’m assuming – <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324609/Battle-of-Kulikovo\">the Battle of Kulikovo</a>, a giant rotating map of the earth, and Eugen Doga’s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWf2UWndBhQ\">Waltz from the 1978 film A Hunting Accident</a>.<br /></p><p>• “It shows all of Russian history, apart from the revolution. There is no Lenin or Stalin,” says someone who saw a rehearsal. The ceremony’s director, Konstantin Ernst – previously responsible for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, Russia’s equivalent of The Voice and a programme called Prozhektorperishilton (which turns out not to be about Paris Hilton despite those final four syllables) – says that 18 episodes from the nation’s history will be portrayed “in an avant-garde style”.<br /></p><p>• It is scheduled to last 160 minutes, and will feature 3,500 fireworks. That’s 21.9 fireworks per minute, or a fraction over one firework every three seconds. Think about that, if ever you get bored – for every three seconds with no fireworks, there’ll be three seconds in your near future with two. Keep your eyes peeled also for tennis ace Maria Sharapova, who lived in Sochi between the ages of two and six, and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev, who is probably there for the first time. Plus musical interludes from soprano Anna Netrebko, who will be singing Russia’s national anthem, and piano ace Denis Matsuev.</p><p>• They’ll be harking back to the opening ceremony for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which was the first great opening spectacular and therefore has a lot to answer for. “For everyone in the Soviet Union, this event was really significant. We will be using this image a little bit in the opening ceremony, and in the closing ceremony quite heavily,” says Ernst. You can watch the entire 1980 opening ceremony <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ErdCb9rIbY#t=5m0s\">here</a>, or just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhEVfh4DMw\">the bit with the giant friendly/terrifying bear who floats into space</a> here:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhEVfh4DMw\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/owhEVfh4DMw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Still want more? We’ve got more!<br /></p><p>• Feast your eyes on this gallery: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2014/feb/05/winter-olympics-90-years-of-photo-memories\">90 years of Winter Olympics memories</a>.</p><p>• Have you got burning questions about Sochi 2014 that need answering? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/04/sochi-snow-skis-scandals\">Good</a>. </p><p>• And here’s e<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014\">verything you need to know about Sochi 2014 in one handy place</a>. <br /></p><p>• There’s some wonderful classic opening ceremony footage on the British Path&eacute; News website <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/oly12-olympic-winter-games-lake-placid/query/opening+ceremony\">here</a>. A mere half-century or so ago a Winter Olympics opening ceremony involved nothing more than some athletes walking gingerly around an ice rink trying not to fall over while a mainly-empty stand applauded half-heartedly.

        "headline":"My beef with Shakira and Rihanna? They're making life harder for bisexuals",
        "body":"<p><strong></strong></p><p><br />You don't have to be a lesbian to enjoy another woman's touch; I'm not and yet I love my girlfriend very much. Bi or pansexual is probably the word that best describes my sexuality, but on the whole I think labels matter very little. As it turns out, I'm not the only one feeling this way; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/13/shakira-rihanna-cant-remember-to-forget-you\" title=\"\">Shakira and Rihanna do too</a>. Don't they?</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://natsal.ac.uk/media/823260/natsal_findings_final.pdf?utm_source=2013%20Findings&amp;utm_medium=Download&amp;utm_campaign=Infographic%20findings%202013\" title=\"\">a recent report</a>, 16% of women aged 16-44 have had a same-sex experience, yet far fewer label themselves as anything other than hetero.</p><p>Why? Could it be because bisexuals are stigmatised as greedy and untrustworthy, often considered only half-committed to the cause by fully-fledged gay people or promiscuous in the eyes of those who are straight? Bisexual has almost become a byword for anything goes, and more often than not bisexuals are thought of as attention-seeking. Two superstars frolicking the to get the attention of a man certainly doesn't help the bisexual cause, which is why I have beef with Shakira and RiRi.</p><p>Women getting steamy in front of man-held cameras is not a new phenomenon, especially not in pop music. So it was hardly surprising when Shakira and Rihanna's video for new single Can't Remember to Forget You was made complete with some saucy images of Sapphic seduction.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with that – other than the usual irresponsible messages that all too many pop stars send their young fans about women needing to strip down in order to get male attention. It's a classic concept that we see every day and one that clearly boosts sales, too.</p><p>What gets to me most, however, is the bit where Rihanna and Shakira sing \"I'd do anything for that boy\" while touching each other's naked skin. While onscreen their use of lesbianism appears to be a way of increasing viewer interest (this is of course one of the oldest tricks in the book, think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/07/tatu-performing-sochi-winter-olympics\" title=\"\">taTu</a>), backstage they both speak openly about how they're sucking their stomachs in trying to out-sex each other. God knows I believe Lily Allen when she says that it's hard out there.</p><p>Shakira and Rihanna are queens of popular music; they set the golden standard. Other artists will try to outdo them, girls will practise their moves and thanks to them, the idea persists that women who engage in lesbian activity, without calling themselves lesbians, do this for attention.</p><p>The YouTube community reflects this – countless comments refer to the video as porn or masturbation fodder. This kind of online behaviour does translate into real life. Walking hand in hand with my girlfriend often results in comments, either loudly shouted or silently whispered, from men \"asking\" for threesomes. Harmless banter, exhibitions of power – or do they really think that's how it works?</p><p>I don't personally think that people, men in particular, are  stupid enough to be fooled by the marketing tricks at play in the world of entertainment. I do, however, think that videos like this let us down. Of course we crave mindless entertainment at times, and there's nothing wrong with being sexy or exploring sexuality, but we need to talk about the way that we portray, and view, non-hetero relationships.</p><p>Why are they sensationalised? Why do we sell lyrics about love for men with lesbian visuals?</p><p>They are misleading for young women struggling with self-image and sexuality, and they're patronising when they assume that more men will buy because of them. Moreover, they further establish the idea that non-straight women really want to be with men, once again undermining the idea that bisexuals are just as loving and faithful to their partners as straight or gay people are.</p><p>There are plenty of women in music doing it right, Mary Lambert and Angel Haze being two of my biggest heroes, but with videos like Shakira and Rihanna's reaching almost 80 million views in one week, it's no wonder that for many the word bisexual still equals greedy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429154656|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|046e059fd82d0d605e04c362c6e78f4fd881eaf0 -->",

        "headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend",
        "body":"<h2>1) Are Fulham building an ark of triumph?</h2><p>Ren&eacute; Meulensteen famously asked his players to visualise themselves as animals, which makes one wonder what animal he himself most resembles. Some endangered species, obviously. Or perhaps an emu, since the waning powers of Damien Duff mean Meulensteen does not have wings of any use (and he also got a fisting by Hull). A lack of width has been far from Fulham's only problem, of course: their manager is a Dutchman who was given a dyke riddled with holes and he has found that plugging just one or two of them has seldom been enough. As a result, his team has generally been as weak a mishmash as this paragraph's metaphors. But in January he sought to bring much-needed balance, energy and firepower and at Old Trafford we will get the first indication as to whether the hasty repair job will be sufficient to save Fulham. And Kostas Mitroglu will get the first indication as to whether he is likely to be given enough opportunities to show how lethal a striker he can be. <strong>PD</strong></p><h2>2) Majestic Mourinho</h2><p>Jos&eacute; Mourinho spent six months sulking about not getting the job he craved, and which he believed was his destiny. His early-season public relations were so transparent that a child could have seen through them. Now, invigorated by the whiff of a winnable title race and a squad he is starting to recognise, he really is The Happy One. Mourinho has been in his element of late, magnetic and majestic during press conferences, while his victory over Manuel Pellegrini was almost comically emphatic. He has the air of a puppeteer, fiddling with the title race as he pleases and flicking subliminal V signs to the rest of the football country. Look out for more during or after the match against Newcastle. When Mourinho is at his best – and he is bang in form right now – every gesture and every syllable serves a greater purpose. <strong>RS</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/feb/04/jose-mourinho-masseur-chelsea-manchester-city-video\" title=\"\">• Mourinho: masseur's team talk helped Chelsea beat City</a></p></blockquote><h2>3) Who will be England's latest World Cup saviour?</h2><p>So every Monday some unlikely player has to be hailed as the missing link in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad, the man whose late surge for a call-up could be the difference between a sorry first-round exit by England and a sorry quarter-final exit. Bandwagons have already been launched to support the candidacies of Tom Huddlestone, Andros Townsend, Gareth Barry and Adam Johnson. Who will it be after the latest round of fixtures? How long before someone suggests that Hodgson should have a proper look at that Tom Cleverley? Oh wait …<strong> PD</strong></p><h2>4) Check out Southampton's midfield linchpin</h2><p>Jack Cork for England! OK, perhaps not, but Cork should certainly start more regularly for Southampton. Victor Wanyama was re-introduced to the side prematurely last week after injury and it was only when Cork came on at half-time that Southampton began to take Fulham apart. He may not be quite as dynamic as Wanyama is (when fully fit) but Cork is not sluggish and is a far more careful and canny passer. He and Morgan Schneiderlin can lay the foundation for victory over Stoke this week. Oh, and Schneiderlin for France! <strong>PD</strong></p><h2>5) Arsenal cannot afford a losing draw</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-429145232\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/07/140207Rodgers-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/07/140207Rodgers/140207Rodgers.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/07/140207Rodgers_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/07//140207Rodgers.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/07/140207Rodgers_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video><p>Beware the day after the Ides of March. On 16 March Arsenal begin a run of four consecutive league games against Spurs (A), Chelsea (A), Man City (H) and Everton (A). If they are to have a chance of becoming the most unlikely title winners since Leeds in 1991-92, they may need to win all five matches before then – especially as Chelsea and City look a decent bet to win their next <em>six </em>league games.</p><p>Ars&egrave;ne Wenger knows about the unforgiving pace of a title race; his team won 10 in a row to clinch the title in 1997-98 and 13 in a row at the back end of 2001-02. Ordinarily a draw at Liverpool would be a good result, especially as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/arsenal-no-regrets-not-signing-luis-suarez-liverpool\" title=\"\">Luis Su&aacute;rez will be desperate to bite the hand that wanted to feed him</a>, but draws are the new defeats for teams aspiring to the title. There is an increasing sense that Arsenal need three points if they are to disprove those who have smugly dismissed them as a deluxe version of Norwich 1992-93, pacemakers set to drop out on the final lap. <strong>RS</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/arsenal-no-regrets-not-signing-luis-suarez-liverpool\" title=\"\">• Wenger: no regrets about Su&aacute;rez</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/feb/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-premier-league-title-video\" title=\"\">• Video: Arsenal are prepared for title battle, says Wenger</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/liverpool-arsenal-history-premier-league\" title=\"\">• Liverpool v Arsenal: why the Reds should worry</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/05/robert-lewandowski-wojciech-szczesny-sign-for-arsenal\" title=\"\">• Lewandowski: 'Szczesny tried to get me to sign'</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/05/luis-suarez-liverpool-fourth-place?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">• Paul Wilson: Su&aacute;rez can push Liverpool higher</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/liverpool-arsenal-anfield-run-end\" title=\"\">• Andy Hunter: Liverpool confident in ending Arsenal run</a></p></blockquote><h2>6) Will Moyes play his Fab Four?</h2><p>Manchester United's squad is more suited to a romantic like Ossie Ardiles, not a pragmatist like David Moyes. With the possible exception of David de Gea their four best players are attackers, yet Moyes is not really in the business of playing anything resembling a 4-2-4. If he cannot find a way to include Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata at home to a team as poor as Fulham, he never will.</p><p>Mata was a panic buy. There is no shame in that – the greatest signing in football history, Eric Cantona, was the ultimate panic buy – yet there are concerns as to how Moyes will use all four players. Januzaj has easily been the highlight of United's season, despite the excessive praise for Rooney's efficiency and endeavour. It is not just that Januzaj needs a decent amount of game time; it is that Moyes needs the reflected goodwill that comes from Januzaj's performances. <strong>RS</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/nemanja-vidic-manchester-united\" title=\"\">• Vidic says he will leave Manchester United in summer</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/darren-fletcher-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">• United's Fletcher admits he is lucky to be playing again</a></p></blockquote><h2>7) Tottenham and Toffees in rare interesting match</h2><p>Everton and Spurs, two of the biggest clubs in the land, yet it has been well over a decade since they faced other in a league match that even neutrals looked forward to. Back in April 1998 they went head-to-head in a highly-fraught relegation battle, this time they meet at White Hart Lane in a match that could go a long way to establishing which of them has the goods to sustain a challenge for a Champions League spot. If either team loses this, they will be almost out of the running. This promises to be fun. <strong>PD</strong></p><h2>8) Are Norwich just going to take a Manchester City backlash?</h2><p>When it comes to style clashes, it is hard to beat Wenger v Sam Allardyce or Roberto Mart&iacute;nez v Tony Pulis. But the biggest juxtaposition of mindsets in the Premier League this season may well take place at Carrow Road this weekend: Manuel Pellegrini can be adventurous to the point of being cavalier, Chris Hughton can be cautious to the point of tears. Injuries may limit Pellegrini's options to beef up the midfield that was bullied by Chelsea on Monday so the major question is: given City's possible vulnerability and the fact that his team's previous attempt to hold them at bay <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/02/manchester-city-norwich-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">resulted in annihilation at the Etihad</a>, will Hughton dare to unshackle his side a tad? <strong>PD</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/manchester-city-fernandinho-fit-barcelona-injury\" title=\"\">• Fernandinho faces Bar&ccedil;a fitness fight</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/feb/04/manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini-chelsea-video\" title=\"\">• Video: changes not to blame for defeat, says Pellegrini</a></p></blockquote><h2>9) Snakes and ladders in the bottom half</h2><p>The relegation clich&eacute; of choice used to be that you were never too good to go down. In recent years, the inequality created by the indefensible avarice of the Premier League has been such that it is now the case that you are never too bad to stay up. If relegation were decided on merit by an independent panel, as many as 11 teams would be up for discussion. As it is three will go, and the snakes and ladders will continue this weekend: West Ham, currently in the relegation zone, could end the weekend in 11th. <strong>RS</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/west-ham-andy-carroll-suspension-swansea\" title=\"\">• FA agrees to West Ham hearing over Carroll ban</a></p></blockquote><h2>10) What style will Swansea play?</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-429146930\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/07/140206Monk-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/07/140206Monk/140206Monk.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/07/140206Monk_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/07/140206Monk_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/07//140206Monk.webm\"></source> </video><p>It would be easy to paint <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/garry-monk-swansea-right-manager\" title=\"\">Garry Monk as the Anglo-Saxon oaf to Michael Laudrup's continental aesthete</a>, though Monk is more educated than most in the enlightened ways of Swansea. In recent weeks many pundits have suggested Swansea need a Plan B to avoid relegation; whether that is viable given their collection of players is open to debate. The new manager may fancy some Garrymonk football; then again, in a decade's time tactics correspondents might be hailing the Monkian philosophy of football as the logical extension of tiki-taka. We will know more after Cardiff's visit. <strong>RS</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/garry-monk-swansea-right-manager\" title=\"\">• Monk 'shocked' but says he is the right man for Swansea</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/michael-laudrup-seeks-legal-advice-swansea-sacking\" title=\"\">• Laudrup seeks legal advice over Swansea sacking</a></p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429110403|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|c5c5388eb76f915b5ee002ce8b1b7a436acb02ab -->",

        "body":"<p>One of the challenges facing novice cooks, to paraphrase that great gastronomist Donald Rumsfeld, is that there are so many <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk\" title=\"\">unknown unknowns</a>. Experienced cooks have an arsenal of shortcuts up their sleeves – tips and tricks they use every day to save time – but these are rarely written down in books or discussed on TV. So you might not even know how many of these unknown unknowns there are to know.</p><p>My wife says I have a public duty to write down some of my most useful timesavers, and I always do what she says. Here they are, in no particular order but the order in which I thought of them. I am sure you will have some of your own. If you do, I implore you to take the time to note them down in the online comments at the bottom of this article, so that together we can make all the unknown unknowns known.</p><p>• Squeeze your lemons through a sieve to take out the pips.</p><p>• Peel ginger with a teaspoon. Try it; you'll see what I mean. It is quicker than using a peeler and there's less waste.</p><p>• For other veg, invest in a good peeler. The best ones are, obviously, sharp, with a big gap between the two blades and a head that swivels easily.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429185283'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391687193810/chopping-006.jpg' alt='chopping' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>• Buy one very, very sharp knife. Maybe Japanese. A large one you can use for everything. It will be expensive, but save up: it will make everything 10 times faster. Tasks that might have reduced you to a sweaty, tearful heap – peeling celeriac, chopping up pumpkin – will be as easy as slicing through butter.</p><p>• Minimise kitchen miles. So much time can be wasted walking about. Don't keep trotting over to the bin: keep a bowl next to you for veg scraps, peelings etc. Keep the pans near the cooker, and (ideally) design your kitchen with the sink, fridge and cooker arranged in a triangle so that nothing is ever too far from reach.</p><p>• Use a coarse grater or the pulse setting on a food processor to chop veg small - for example the onions, carrots, and celery in the base of your bolognese.</p><p>• To peel lots of garlic super-fast, put the bulb/bulbs in a metal bowl, use another metal bowl as a lid, and shake the whole thing vigorously. Martha Stewart does a demonstration of this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0abnwTGeAiM\" title=\"\">life-changing technique on YouTube</a>. Maybe they didn't let her have a knife in prison.</p><p>• Browning your meat separately before making a stew, chilli, or bolognese (as suggested in the recipe below) is not always necessary. It will still taste delicious – just different – if you leave out that step.</p><p>• Wash up as you go: keep surfaces clear and&nbsp;uncluttered.</p><p>• Place your chopping board over a damp cloth, to prevent it from moving around when&nbsp;you are chopping/slicing.</p><p>• Cook with the washing-up in mind. Ideally, use saucepans that can go in the dishwasher if you have one, and as few as possible. Casseroles and pot roasts are brilliant for minimal clearing-up.<br /> <br />• Read every recipe through before starting, like an exam paper, so you know what steps lie ahead.</p><p>• Then stop and think: that is how it has always been done, but do I really need to do it like that? This is how Jane and I came up with this not-quite cottage pie that uses sliced potatoes instead of mash.</p><h2>Not-quite cottage pie</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429185284'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391686579725/not-quite-cottage-pie-009.jpg' alt='not-quite-cottage-pie' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p><br /><strong>Preparation:</strong> 15 minutes</p><p><strong>Cooking time: </strong>1 hour 20 minutes</p><p>Serves 4-6&nbsp;<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>500g lean beef mince</strong><br /><strong>1 onion, peeled and chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 leek, chopped</strong><br /><strong>400g root veg, peeled– I used carrots, turnip and&nbsp;swede</strong><br /><strong>500ml chicken stock (a cube is fine)</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp tomato puree</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Marmite</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp soy sauce</strong><br /><strong>800g potatoes&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan on a high heat until very hot. Tip in the minced beef, leave for a minute to brown and stir. Don't stir too much or the meat will boil rather than brown. When the beef is nicely coloured (should take about 5 minutes) remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set to one side.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2</strong> Add the onion and leek to the pan, stir and cook gently over a low heat for 5 minutes until they are soft. Coarsely grate the root veg and add it to the onion and leek. Mix well and cook gently for 5 minutes. Return the meat and its juices to the pan, stir well to combine and season with salt and pepper.</p><p><strong>3 </strong>Pour in the hot stock with the tomato puree, Marmite, Worcestershire sauce and soy. Simmer all the ingredients together for 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>4 </strong>While the meat and vegetables are simmering peel (or just scrub) and finely slice the potatoes. Mix them in a bowl with lots of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5</strong> Transfer the meat and veg to a deep casserole dish. Taste it. Season it if necessary. Top with the sliced potatoes and cover with a&nbsp;lid or foil. Place in the oven for 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6 </strong>Remove the lid and return to the oven for a&nbsp;further 20 minutes. Check that the potatoes are cooked through with a knife.</p><p><strong>7</strong> Serve with peas or purple sprouting broccoli.</p><p><em>Recipe by Jane Baxter</em></p><h2>For show offs</h2><p>Try layering the top with other root veg, such as celeriac or Jerusalem artichokes; just slice finely, and cook for the same amount of time.</p><h2>What else can you do?</h2><p>If you want to turn this into shepherd's pie, substitute mashed potato for sliced, and minced lamb for beef.</p><p>Henry Dimbleby is cofounder of the natural fast-food restaurant chain <a href=\"www.leonrestaurants.co.uk\" title=\"\">Leon </a>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Henry_Leon\" title=\"\">@henry_leon</a>).

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>The SNP said the speech reflected jitters in the no campaign and said it was despicable that Cameron had dragged in the emotion of British Olympic success to win an argument about independence.</p><p>But Cameron brushed aside the criticism, saying: \"Sometimes we can forget just how big our reputation is, that the world over the letters 'UK' stand for unique, brilliant, creative, eccentric, ingenious. We come as a brand – a powerful brand.</p><p>\"Separating Scotland out of that brand would be like separating the waters of the river Tweed and the North Sea. If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation. The plain fact is we matter more in the world together.</p><p>\"Our reach is about much more than military might – it's about our music, film, TV, fashion. The UK is the soft power superpower: you get teenagers in Tokyo and Sydney listening to Emeli Sandé; people in Kazakhstan and Taiwan watching BBC exports like Sherlock, written by a Scot a hundred years ago, played by an Englishman today, and created for TV by a Scotsman.\"</p><p>And he said he wanted his daughter to be able to read his favourite childhood book – HE Marshall's Our Island Story: A History of Britain for Boys and Girls from the Romans to Queen Victoria – which tells the \"great, world-beating story\" of the UK.</p><p>He said: \"I passionately hope that my children will be able to teach their children the same – that the stamp on their passport is a mark of pride. That together, these islands really do stand for something more than the sum of our parts, they stand for bigger ideals, nobler causes, greater values.</p><p>\"This is our home – and I could not bear to see that home torn apart. I love this country. I love the United Kingdom and all it stands for. And I will fight with all I have to keep us together.\"</p><p>In a warning to people who have so far given the referendum debate little attention, he said: \"Centuries of history hang in the balance; a question mark hangs over the future of our United Kingdom.</p><p>\"If people vote yes in September, then Scotland will become an independent country. There will be no going back.\"</p><p>Cameron said for him the best thing about the Olympics \"wasn't the winning; it was the red, the white, the blue. It was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun. Everyone cheering as one for Team GB.\"</p><p>He ended his speech with a plea to everyone in the UK to urge Scotland to stay: \"I want to be clear to everyone listening. There can be no complacency about the result of this referendum. The outcome is still up in the air and we have just seven months to go. Seven months to do all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one. Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history.</p><p>\"And we must do whatever it takes. So to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; everyone, like me, who cares about the United Kingdom, I want to say this: you don't have a vote, but you do have a voice. Those voting are our friends, neighbours and family.</p><p>\"You do have an influence. Get on the phone, get together, email, tweet, speak. Let the message ring out from Manchester to Motherwell, from Pembrokeshire to Perth, from Belfast to Bute, from us to the people of Scotland – let the message be this: we want you to stay.\"</p><p>Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy first minister of Scotland, said: \"It is a mistake to mix politics and sport in this way. I welcome people in the rest of the UK like David Cameron being part of the debate, but he cannot have his cake and eat it. He cannot say 'I want to be part of the debate', but then say 'No, I am not prepared to come to Scotland and have a head-to-head debate with the first minister [Alex Salmond]'.</p><p>\"If that continues to be his position, he does not have the courage of his convictions, he does not have the guts to come here and actually test his argument against the arguments of Alex Salmond, and the yes campaign.</p><p>\"If David Cameron is still not prepared to do that but continue to deliver lectures from London, people will draw their own conclusions from that.\"</p><p>She added: \"Now we are being love-bombed, so let us celebrate the bonds of history, culture and family in all parts of the UK – but that does not mean we should be governed from London.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429166714|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|cdb5d0678729054a19e56551a54351a10b1d7d28 -->",

        "headline":"The truth about the Tiger Mother's family",
        "body":"<p>Amy Chua has been accused of many things – a&nbsp;cruel approach to parenting, gratuitous use of cultural stereotypes, a talent for sensationalism – but cowardice isn't one of them. She provoked uproar with her 2011 memoir, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408822074\" title=\"\">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</a>, charting her unbending rules for raising her daughters, and spent two years dealing with the fallout, including death threats, racial slurs and pitchfork-waving calls for her arrest on child-abuse charges.</p><p>She might, therefore, have been expected to take an easier road with her follow-up. Instead, she and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, have written The Triple Package, which is devoted to one of the most inflammatory subjects imaginable – why some cultural groups soar ahead in the US (while others, by implication, fail). The book charts how three specific qualities, which they argue are essential to success, are passed down through the generations, often through the family.</p><p>Chua has said she just wants to be liked, that she doesn't aim to be controversial, and in person, if not her work, this is obvious. In the living room of her family's large New York apartment, light streaming through the windows, she is every bit the effusive, encouraging professor, just what you'd expect from someone who has won a teaching award for her work at Yale law&nbsp;school. Rubenfeld, also a Yale law professor and bestselling author (his thriller The Interpretation of Murder reached No 1 in the UK), is quite different. Where she is enthusiastic, he&nbsp;is dry and sardonic; where she is clearly keen to ace this interview, he is witty, but much more guarded.</p><p>His suspicion isn't surprising. &quot;Jed's so much more sensible and prudent,&quot; says Chua. &quot;I kept saying: 'I don't think this book is going to be controversial, because it has so many studies in it …' But Jed said: 'Amy, it's going to be controversial!'&quot;</p><p>&quot;She kept imagining it wouldn't be,&quot; says Rubenfeld. &quot;She felt like the last [book] wouldn't be either, so …&quot; He lets this notion linger a second.</p><p>Chua's memoir might have been more nuanced and self-satirising than some critics suggested, but the firestorm it prompted was completely predictable. It began with a list of child-rearing edicts, including the fact that the couple's daughters, Sophia and Lulu, were never allowed to attend a sleepover, get any grade less than an A,&nbsp;fail to come first in any class except gym and drama, and had to play the piano or violin. No exceptions, no excuses. It continued through the time&nbsp;she called Sophia &quot;garbage&quot;, and threatened to burn her soft toys. They&nbsp;were pushed to spend so much time practising musical instruments that Rubenfeld once found Sophia's teeth marks in the piano.</p><p>With The Triple Package, says Rubenfeld: &quot;I said, the first headlines are going to be that we're racist, and it's ridiculous, because the book is the opposite. Nothing to do with skin colour, groups from every possible skin colour, religious and racial background … Nothing to do with genetics. But I&nbsp;said, you'll see, they're going to say that, just to be sensational.&quot;</p><p>Rubenfeld's prediction proved accurate again. The book began generating controversy before it was even published, with <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/01/04/tiger-mom-some-groups-are-just-better-than-others/\" title=\"\">an article in the New York Post last month</a> calling it &quot;a series of shock-arguments wrapped in self-help tropes and it's meant to do what racist arguments do: scare people.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-429152456\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391532347811/Amy-Chua-and-daughters-008.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Chua and daughters\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Amy Chua with daughters Lulu (left) and Sophia. Photograph: Lorenzo Ciniglio/Polaris</figcaption></figure><p>That article was headlined &quot;Tiger Mom: Some cultural groups are superior,&quot; an echo of the Wall Street Journal headline that whipped up such a storm around her memoir: <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754\" title=\"\">&quot;Why Chinese mothers are superior.&quot;</a> Much of the anger around Chua derives from this idea that she considers herself and her culture better than all others – in her memoir she played constantly on perceived differences between Chinese and western parents, tapping into deep anxiety and insecurity about a rising China and the slide of the west.</p><p>Ideas of superiority are central to her new book too, but she says she hopes after reading The Triple Package, people &quot;don't think we're saying some groups are [inherently] better&quot;. She points to the book's subtitle, &quot;how three unlikely traits explain the rise and fall of cultural groups in America&quot;, and stresses the rise and fall element. The couple are providing &quot;a snapshot of who is doing well right now&quot;, she says. &quot;Twenty years from now it could be somebody different … The big thing for us is – I think we say this – anyone from any background, any ethnicity, can have these qualities. It's just that if you're in certain groups, it's almost like the odds are higher.&quot;</p><p>Part of the reason for the changing fortunes of some groups, she says, is the immigrant arc, which suggests first-generation immigrants tend to have exceptional drive, a quality passed on to their kids, &quot;but once you get to the third generation, they're exactly the same as other Americans. So it's very dynamic.&quot;</p><p>As the daughter of Chinese immigrants herself, it was precisely this third generation lapse that Chua was trying to avoid in bringing up her own daughters. In Battle Hymn …, she writes that she was determined &quot;not to raise a soft, entitled child – not to let my family fall&quot;.</p><p>The Triple Package identifies eight groups that are particularly successful in the US at the moment – Indian, Chinese, Iranian, Lebanese, Nigerian and Cuban groups, along with Mormons and Jewish people. The couple's definition of success has riled some readers, revolving, as it does, around the bald data of income and education levels. &quot;We looked at the US census, these income measures,&quot; says Chua, &quot;so very materialistic senses of success, but we're not saying this is the only way – this doesn't mean happiness, you know?&quot;</p><p>Still, for those wishing to be rich and&nbsp;academically successful, the book defines three essential traits that contribute to drive, all passed down at&nbsp;least partly through the family. The&nbsp;first is a superiority complex, the&nbsp;sense that your particular group is&nbsp;exceptional. This belief, &quot;can be religious&quot;, they write, &quot;as in the case of Mormons. It can be rooted in a story about the magnificence of your people's history and civilisation, as in the case of Chinese or Persians.&quot; They're aware how dangerous this quality can be – ambivalence surrounds all the triple-package qualities. &quot;Group superiority is the stuff of racism, colonialism, imperialism, Nazism,&quot; they continue. &quot;Yet every one of America's extremely successful groups fosters a belief in its own superiority.&quot;</p><p>The second essential quality – insecurity – might seem contradictory, but apparently provides the grit in the oyster. &quot;Everyone is probably insecure in one way or another,&quot; they write, &quot;but some groups are more prone to it&nbsp;than others. To be an immigrant is almost by definition to be insecure.&quot; They note that the idea of insecurity as&nbsp;a lever of success is anathema in western society, and that, &quot;the greatest anathema of all would be parents working to instil insecurity in their children. Yet insecurity runs deep in every one of America's most successful groups, and these groups not only suffer from insecurity; they tend, consciously or unconsciously, to promote it.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-429152455\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391532899143/Amy-Chua-and-family-008.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Chua and family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Amy Chua with her husband Jed, Sophia, left and Lulu.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the third quality is impulse control, which they define as the ability to resist temptation. &quot;Against the background of a relatively permissive America,&quot; they write, &quot;some groups decidedly place greater emphasis on impulse control than others.&quot; They write that, while there is now a tendency to romanticise childhood, to see it as a time, ideally, of unfettered happiness, &quot;every one of America's most successful groups takes a very different view of childhood and&nbsp;of impulse control in general, inculcating habits of discipline from an early age – at least they did so when they were on the rise.&quot;</p><p>The book is a strange mix. It seems too simplistic to be taken seriously as an academic theory, too dry to fit into the usual notion of a popular ideas book. Much of the deep uneasiness in reading it comes not from what is said about the eight groups in question, but what is unsaid about the hundreds of others. If impulse control is a key marker of success, for instance, then there is an obvious and ugly implication that other groups are simply undisciplined. It seems likely that many groups share the same roster of qualities as the most successful ones – but undermined by a much more difficult history and a different fabric of&nbsp;discrimination. The couple do acknowledge this in the book, and in person, but it feels as if this side of the analysis doesn't go deep enough.</p><p>At times, the book reads most obviously as a defence of the tiger parenting Chua espoused in her memoir. She says they didn't think of it in this way, but that its message is completely consistent with Battle Hymn …, in that it highlights the positive side of inculcating extreme drive – and the negatives. I ask whether she comes from a triple-package background and she says: &quot;One hundred per cent.&quot;</p><p>How would she define this?</p><p>&quot;This idea of high expectations,&quot; she says. &quot;The message that my parents sent was definitely, 'You can be the best student, you are amazing,' but instead of the more western thing, which is, 'and we just want you to feel great about yourself' they're like 'but you haven't done well enough yet!' There were very high expectations, and also a big insecurity, in that when my parents came to the US they literally had nothing. I mean, they couldn't afford heat in Boston, which is colder than London, you know? So it was like, you need to be a good student, because otherwise we may not be able to survive.&quot;</p><p>When it came to impulse control, she watched her father, a scientist and renowned expert in chaos theory, work until three every morning, &quot;so they didn't even have to tell me. I used to wake up and my dad was always working.&quot; (Now in his late 70s, her father is still taking up international fellowships, and flying all around the world giving talks.) People made fun of her accent and her looks while she was growing up. &quot;I was an ugly kid, with glasses and braces, and English was my second language, and I remember people saying, 'Ha, ha, slanty eyes.' And my mother had a very strong sense of ethnic pride, which was, like: 'Why do you care what these kids are making fun of you about? We come from the most ancient civilisation, China invented all these things, we have a high culture, who cares what they think?' So that's what we call this ethnic armour.&quot;</p><p>Rubenfeld says he couldn't have been raised more differently. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants, and his parents, both brought up in Orthodox families in smalltown Pennsylvania, rebelled against their upbringing, and were much more liberal and permissive with their own&nbsp;children. Still, he also grew up watching his father, a psychotherapist, work until 3am. &quot;I would say that my dad was very much what we describe in the book,&quot; he says, &quot;because he was an immigrant's kid, and very driven, and had this insecurity of the kind we're describing.&quot;</p><p>Rubenfeld jokes that he provided the insecurity portion of the book, before talking more seriously about one of the problems associated with the triple package – they have a whole chapter on the pathologies associated with the three traits. &quot;I know that I am unhappier,&quot; he says, &quot;because I always feel like whatever I've done is not good enough. It doesn't matter what I do – so that's painful, and I worry that I've communicated that to my kids.&quot;</p><p>Reading this on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F1EFPZoznU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Click here to watch</a></p><p>When Chua published Battle Hymn …, critics noted Rubenfeld's absence from the book – an absence he had encouraged. This led to questions about how supportive he was of her parenting techniques, and today he says when she started using them he was shocked. But he clearly respected her approach. &quot;That's not how I was raised, and if I had been a single parent, my kids would probably just be garbage men or something like that. But when I saw her instincts, I was very much in favour of them, because my parents were a little too permissive.&quot; I ask in what way, and he says he wishes his parents had made him learn a musical instrument. Instead, he was given a choice, &quot;between violin lessons or tennis lessons, and I picked tennis, but we didn't really follow through with that either&quot;. It has to be said, his parents' approach doesn't seem to have worked out too shabbily for him.</p><p>He felt very bad for his wife when the memoir was published, &quot;because she was getting dragged through so many ridiculous accusations, and people didn't understand – because, in part, she left this out of her book – how much her kids love her. They didn't understand how much she loves her kids. They didn't know about the four of us in bed watching TV or reading books, how often we just had fun together. I knew Amy could take it, but I felt bad because the kids were being insulted in the media, so I wanted to hack into the accounts of all the people who were saying that, and go and find them, and do something illegal to them.&quot;</p><p>Their kids took it all in their stride though. Rubenfeld says he was searching online, &quot;to see what people are saying, and they're like, 'Why are you doing that? We don't care what people are saying!'&quot; Sophia is currently at Harvard and Lulu was recently accepted at Yale.</p><p>The member of the family who seems to care most about the backlash is Chua; understandably, given that she was the prime target, but surprisingly, given her image. She says she keeps the hate mail she's received in an email folder entitled &quot;Do not look&quot;, and as a new round has started coming in, she has stuck to this rule.</p><p>In light of that, it's surprising she's put her head above the parapet with this new book – she can't really have been oblivious to the likely reaction. Although in her memoir and her new book, Chua traces some of the problems with what could be called, almost interchangeably, triple-package or tiger parenting, there is no doubt she is essentially in favour of it. &quot;Self-control, discipline, resilience,&quot; she says. &quot;I got that from my parents. I remember once, I got rejected. I was trying to get a professor job, and I applied to, like, 500 places, and I think I got 500 rejections, and I called my dad and said: 'I don't think I can be a professor.' He said: 'Wait, how many rejections did you get?' And I said '500'. And he said: 'You got 500 rejections, and you want to give up? You think that's a LOT?!'&quot; Love her or hate her, she won't give up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/428903236|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|cea4f25b2938557ab70da900c47743d6ece0ddb7 -->",

        "headline":"Per Mertesacker: 'Luis Suárez is like a cheeky boy. We were up for him joining'",
        "body":"<p>Per Mertesacker is lecturing and he is eminently qualified to do so. The subject matter is history and psychology, through the prism of Germany's habit of beating England in international football matches and Arsenal's big, friendly centre-half from Hannover is on a roll.</p><p>\"You respect us for our footballing past but what happens when you play against us is that it's always the same,\" Mertesacker says. \"All of our young players in Germany, they don't even know what happened previously but in England, especially the newspapers, they remind us how well we did or how frightening we are or how we always win no matter what happens and that makes us even stronger.</p><p>\"We would normally have forgotten but you always remind us. I think it would be better for the English people if they think that it's now a different German generation and you just try to beat us or maybe try to copy us. You'd have better karma.\"</p><p>Germans, eh? Mertesacker does not even mention the Wembley friendly between the nations from last November, when he headed his country's winner – a personal high in a season of stellar levels. The 29-year-old has great expectations for the World Cup finals in the summer.</p><p>But before that, Mertesacker is consumed by another well-worn narrative and it is one that he is determined to rework. Arsenal have not won a trophy since 2005 and, although they sit two points clear at the top of the Premier League with 14 matches to play, nagging doubts remain about their durability. They have form for implosion.</p><p>\"Nobody knows how to treat us at the moment,\" Mertesacker says, and he is probably right.</p><p>Arsenal have had their season charted by potential crash points, when the tailspin was supposed to happen and Mertesacker describes the one that is now upon them as the \"proper test\". They visit Liverpool on Saturday lunchtime before they play Manchester United (also a league match); Liverpool in the FA Cup and Bayern Munich in the Champions League. The games come in the space of 11 days.</p><p>\"There are a lot of mental tests,\" Mertesacker says. \"How good are we when we maybe get another setback? Are we able to come back in the way that we have always come back this season?\"</p><p>Mertesacker chooses his words carefully but it is clear that he thinks there is something different about the Arsenal of this season, something hardier and capable of taking a surer route. \"That's what I try to explain, although it's really hard because we haven't proved anything yet,\" Mertesacker says.</p><p>He talks of the depth to the squad, how he draws \"strength\" from the sight of players stepping in for injured team-mates to make the difference, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for example, did with his two goals against Crystal Palace last Sunday.</p><p>Above all, though, he advances the sense of precision and successful fine-tuning, from the club's record signing of Mesut Özil last September to the work of the assistant manager, Steve Bould, on the defensive drills in training. With Mertesacker's partnership with Laurent Koscielny to the fore, Arsenal have been miserly at the back this season.</p><p>\"Steve likes to work with us, especially with the back four,\" Mertesacker says. \"We are grateful for his influence, his tips and his little hints as to what we might do better in any situation. We've worked just on details and that's what it's about, that's what really pays off now. From the start, he tried to be an influence. He's a good addition on the coaching staff.\"</p><p>Özil, who Mertesacker played with at Werder Bremen, has been a mood-changer, even if he has been quiet at times. \"To reach another level, you sometimes need the right addition to lift everybody, not just the players but the whole club and the whole public in between,\" Mertesacker says. \"We didn't need five or six players late in the window, which is what Arsenal got when I arrived [in August 2011]. It is not easy to get everyone settled. We were a good squad and we didn't lose any players over the summer, which was the main part. But we needed that right addition and we can say that Özil was it.\"</p><p>Özil's signing followed the failed pursuit of the Liverpool striker Luis Suárez, whom Mertesacker will face at Anfield. \"Suárez is like a cheeky boy, he looks like a cheeky boy who can really switch on and off how he wants to be, so that is really something,\" Mertesacker says. \"When he is on the pitch, what is going on around him doesn't bother him.</p><p>\"He is just a pure striker and that is what comes out after the transfer requests and him saying: 'It's better for me to leave because I want to play Champions League.' When we heard that Arsenal might be interested in him, obviously we were up for it and we thought, 'Yeah, he would fit in.' But after, we got Özil.\"</p><p>Mertesacker sports a pale yellow bruise to his left temple, the legacy of a stray elbow from the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny on the training ground and the buffeting, whether physical or mental, has come to feel relentless.</p><p>Mertesacker says that he misses the winter break he enjoyed in Germany at Hannover and Werder while he admits that he struggles to sleep after matches, particularly those in the evenings. \"After you have won a game, you can maybe smile for a minute and then you have to think: 'How can I recover as quickly as possible,'\" Mertesacker adds.</p><p>Yet there is the competitor's relish for the challenges ahead and it is plain that Arsenal has got under his skin. He feels that he owes the manager, Arsène Wenger, for helping him through an error-strewn and injury-curtailed first season and he is ready to extend his contract beyond June 2015.</p><p>\"The first year wasn't that successful but, after that, with how the manager dealt with the situation and helped me to come back even stronger … that is something very special so that's why my target is to extend my contract here,\" Mertesacker says. \"We are in good progress with the negotiations. It's up to the manager, of course, but I am really up for it.\"</p><p>Mertesacker ticks the boxes for fan worship, being stylish, wholehearted and, in the words of an Arsenal fans' song, a big, fucking German. \"It took me a long time to understand the song they sing about me, that it was not them trying to bully me,\" Mertesacker says. \"People explained to me that it was more an expression of love.\"</p><p>Mertesacker is down-to-earth, as was evidenced by his decision to chose community rather than military service, after he signed his first professional contract at Hannover, and going to work for three hours each day at an institute for the mentally ill. \"That kept my feet on the ground,\" he says.</p><p>Arsenal fans also delighted in his on-field berating of Özil following the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City last December; Özil had made straight for the dressing room, and not the travelling supporters. \"We have to present ourselves as a unit, no matter what happens,\" says Mertesacker. \"That is what Arsenal stands for.</p><p>\"He was just angry, so was I and, sometimes, it's good to argue, to let your feelings out. It's nearly disappeared in football life because when something happens, players keep it inside and they are pissed over the next three weeks. That's not what I want to see with anybody. There can be a little battle but, afterwards, shake hands and forget about it. That is a culture I like.\"</p><p>Mertesacker's brother, Timo, has come to like the culture of English football and he likes it so much that he looks to coincide his visits from Germany with Arsenal away fixtures. He travels to them on fans' coaches.</p><p>\"He loves to feel the atmosphere of the coach and the away fans,\" Mertesacker says. \"It must be really strange for the fans as well because he looks like me. He's three years younger and three or four centimetres smaller. He might say, when he talks to the fans, 'There's my brother, he's playing today.' A few have gone mental. He just wants to improve his English, too.\"</p><p>Mertesacker is focused game-by-game but he cannot resist a peep at Bayern, who knocked Arsenal out of last season's Champions League en route to the trophy. Arsenal did win the second leg of the last-16 tie 2-0 in Munich but it was not enough to prevent the away-goals exit.</p><p>\"Under Pep Guardiola this season, Bayern look even sharper and with more possession,\" Mertesacker says. \"I thought that they were the best team in Europe last season and it would be really hard for them to improve but they've done it. They have the Barça style in their mind from four or five years ago, when they smashed everyone.</p><p>\"But it's not a worry because we know that we can beat them. The key is the first leg at the Emirates. We had too much respect for them last time so it's up to us to create something special. Can we compete with these teams or not?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429165640|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|a4e5adb1d037de7d61a30eea3d707bb3fb45dd82 -->",

When Margaret started, the tool of choice was a curved nail; more recently this has been replaced with imported razor blades.</p><p>The work, she concedes, is gruelling: frightened young girls would typically sit naked on a rock; once done, their excised clitorises would be thrown to the birds. For the cutters, or \"koko mekong\", who can earn 2,500 Kenyan shillings (£18) for each girl, it is a livelihood.</p><p>\"The cutters ask me: 'If we leave doing this thing, what will we eat?'\" Margaret says. \"Tell the government to give us what to eat. If it's just workshops then it will be no use. The circumcisers will not leave their career simply because they're being told to leave it.\"</p><p>The \"cut\" has been outlawed in Kenya since 2001. Despite this, a public health survey in 2009 found that 27% of women had been subject to FGM. Among some ethnic groups – such as the Somalis (98%) and Masai (73%) – that figure is much higher.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429167350'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391776411261/Margaret-who-performs-FGM-009.jpg' alt='Margaret, who performs FGM' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Margaret, from Pokot, northern Kenya, who has 'cut' more girls than she can remember</figcaption></figure><p>A second set of laws passed in 2011 made it illegal to promote or to facilitate what used to be known as female circumcision, and stiffened penalties. But changing the law was easier than changing practice.</p><p>Among communities such as the Endorois, who live near the picturesque Lake Bogoria, the cutting season has endured. But the ban has driven it underground, according to Elijah Kipteroi, the government-appointed chief of nearby Loboi, a role he describes as part policeman, part doctor, with a dash of marriage counsellor thrown in.</p><p>\"In the old days there were preparations that you could see,\" Kipteroi said. \"Now, because of the law, the practice is carried on in hiding. It's happening without ceremonies.\"</p><p>The laws are still seen as foreign by many Endorois, especially the male elders, says the chief. They accuse him of criminalising their culture.</p><p>Underpinning the practice is a sharply divergent vision of the roles of sons and daughters. In Kenya, a dowry is paid by the groom's family. As a result, girls are seen as a valuable asset to their families, if they can be offered for marriage in the \"right\" condition.</p><p>\"The daughters are seen as cattle to be sold,\" said Kipteroi, who added that a bride price would be typically counted in livestock, worth perhaps as much as 30 cows. \"No one will even negotiate a bride price for uncut girls.\"</p><p>On the surface, communities in places such as Loboi are broadly supportive of traditions such as FGM. Uncut girls, sometimes referred to as \"raw\" as opposed to mutilated \"ripe\" women, can expect to be shunned by their neighbours. They are forced to walk for miles to fetch water so they don't \"contaminate\" pumps and wells; local midwives even refuse to deliver their \"unclean\" babies.</p><p>Reuben Orgut, a wiry man in his 60s with a sprinkling of silver stubble, one of the elders in Sandai, is unapologetic about FGM and the economics behind it.</p><p>\"When I get this dowry it's a way to support the other siblings. It means that when my sons also marry I have something to give out.\"</p><p>He says the girls who refuse to be cut and married off are \"stealing\" from their own families. \"It is not fair since they are a source of wealth. Some who have not been circumcised leave the family without us getting the bride wealth.\"</p><p>However, not everyone is so keen to defend the rite.</p><p>Joseph Kapkurere is one of a trio of local teachers who have been trying to change ingrained attitudes among pupils and parents, even if doing so comes at the cost of frequent confrontation with relatives, friends and neighbours.</p><p>Kapkurere escaped the strictures that he grew up with when he went to college in Kisumu, a city in western Kenya where female genital mutilation is not common. \"I was able to question why this happens and make up my own mind,\" he said.</p><p>He married a woman from another ethnic group and resisted his relatives' entreaties to have her undergo FGM. In Kapkurere's home community he estimates that nine out of 10 girls are mutilated. As a teacher he found that schoolgirls would tell him that their parents were arranging for them to be cut against their will. He decided to start offering sanctuary during the school holidays which were often used by parents to have the girls mutilated.</p><p>\"We thought at least we can keep them in school for longer, we can buy some time and subvert the parents' plans,\" he said.</p><p>And so now, during the longer holidays, dozens of girls will stay in the sanctuary of the school in Sandai to avoid the rite of passage.</p><p>The Cana girls' rescue centre, set among the dark volcanic rock, aloes and thorny acacias north of Lake Baringo, is home to more proof of the limits of legislation in changing lives.</p><p>The Rev Christopher Chochoi, a Catholic priest, set up the shelter in 2002 after praying with a young girl as she died from the rat poison she had consumed rather than return to the violent and abusive old man she had been forced to marry.</p><p>Today, it houses around 50 girls, some of whom have fled forced marriages, as well as runaways or outcasts who have refused to submit to FGM and have been ostracised by their families.</p><p>One of them is Diana, 16, who came to Cana two years ago. She walked for nearly three days through the bush to avoid being married off after being pressured into being cut – a brutal procedure that left her angry and disillusioned.</p><p>\"I knew I was going to be circumcised because we were being pressurised but I didn't know it was bad and would lead to marriage afterwards,\" she said.</p><p>She had been expecting a \"good adventure\", she remembers ruefully, and was ignorant of what was coming when she went to see the koko mekong with four friends.</p><p>\"I regret having undergone the circumcision because some of my friends, after undergoing it, bled to death. Some of them had challenges when giving birth because of age and as a result they ended up dying while giving birth.\"</p><p>Chochoi's wife, Nelly, hopes that the experience of young women such as Joan Rikono, who stayed for five years at Cana, will inspire other girls. The 25-year-old earned a scholarship at a college and returns to mentor the rescue centre's current residents.</p><p>Nelly hopes Rikono can show the community they are wrong to think of educated girls as lost or worthless.</p><p>Nonetheless, the job of persuasion is slow and dangerous. The centre's matriarch came to face to face with the risks two years ago when furious and armed male relatives of one of the girls stormed into the centre. They demanded that one of the girls who was due to be cut and married off be handed over. A tall woman with a strong, clear voice, she stood her ground: \"I told them we don't have any wives here, just schoolgirls.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/428883898|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|e6372a075140ec0704cbb430d6a68936d59fd128 -->",

        "headline":"Russell Brand: my life without drugs",
        "body":"<p>The last time I thought about taking heroin was yesterday. I had received \"an inconvenient truth\" from a beautiful woman. It wasn't about climate change – I'm not that ecologically switched on – she told me she was pregnant and it&nbsp;wasn't mine.</p><p>I had to take immediate action. I put Morrissey on in my car as an external conduit for the surging melancholy, and as I wound my way through the neurotic Hollywood hills, the narrow lanes and tight bends were a material echo of the synaptic tangle where my thoughts stalled and jammed.</p><p>Morrissey, as ever, conducted a symphony, within and without and the tidal misery burgeoned. I am becoming possessed. The part of me that experienced the negative data, the self, is becoming overwhelmed, I can no longer see where I end and the pain begins. So now I have a choice.</p><p>I cannot accurately convey to you the efficiency of heroin in neutralising pain. It transforms a tight, white fist into a gentle, brown wave. From my first inhalation 15 years ago, it fumigated my private hell and lay me down in its hazy pastures and a bathroom floor in Hackney embraced me like a womb.</p><p>This shadow is darkly cast on the retina of my soul and whenever I am dislodged from comfort my focus falls&nbsp;there.</p><p>It is 10 years since I used drugs or drank alcohol and my life has improved immeasurably. I have a job, a house, a cat, good friendships and generally a&nbsp;bright outlook.</p><p>The price of this is constant vigilance because the disease of addiction is not rational. Recently for the purposes of a documentary on this subject I&nbsp;reviewed&nbsp;some footage of myself smoking heroin that my friend had shot as part of a&nbsp;typically exhibitionist attempt of&nbsp;mine&nbsp;to get clean.</p><p>I sit wasted and slumped with an unacceptable haircut against a wall in another Hackney flat (Hackney is starting to seem like part of the problem) inhaling fizzy, black snakes of smack off a scrap of crumpled foil. When I saw the tape a month or so ago, what is surprising is that my reaction is not one of gratitude for the positive changes I've experienced but envy at witnessing an earlier version of myself unencumbered by the burden of abstinence. I sat in a suite at the Savoy hotel, in privilege, resenting the woeful ratbag I once was, who, for all his problems, had drugs. That is obviously irrational.</p><p>The mentality and behaviour of drug addicts and alcoholics is wholly irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and unless they have structured help they have no hope.</p><p>This is the reason I have started a fund within Comic Relief, Give It Up. I&nbsp;want to raise awareness of, and money for, abstinence-based recovery. It was Kevin Cahill's idea, he is the bloke who runs Comic Relief. He called me when he read an article I wrote after Amy Winehouse died. Her death had a powerful impact on me I suppose because it was such an obvious shock, like watching someone for hours through a telescope, seeing them advance towards you, fist extended with the intention of punching you in the face. Even though I saw it coming, it still hurt when it eventually hit me.</p><p>What was so painful about Amy's death is that I know that there is something I could have done. I could have passed on to her the solution that was freely given to me. Don't pick up a drink or drug, one day at a time. It sounds so simple. It actually is simple but it isn't easy: it requires incredible support and fastidious structuring. Not to mention that the whole infrastructure of abstinence based recovery is shrouded in necessary secrecy. There are support fellowships that are easy to find and open to anyone who needs them but they eschew promotion of any kind in order to preserve the purity of their purpose, which is for people with alcoholism and addiction to help one another stay clean and sober.</p><p>Without these fellowships I would take drugs. Because, even now, the condition persists. Drugs and alcohol are not my problem, reality is my problem, drugs and alcohol are my solution.</p><p>If this seems odd to you it is because you are not an alcoholic or a drug addict. You are likely one of the 90% of people who can drink and use drugs safely. I&nbsp;have friends who can smoke weed, swill gin, even do crack and then merrily get on with their lives. For me, this is not an option. I will relinquish all else to ride that buzz to oblivion. Even if it began as a timid glass of chardonnay on a ponce's yacht, it would end with me necking the bottle, swimming to shore and sprinting to Bethnal Green in search of a crack house. I look to drugs and booze to fill up a hole in me; unchecked, the call of the wild is too strong. I still survey streets for signs of the subterranean escapes that used to provide my sanctuary. I still eye the shuffling subclass of junkies and dealers, invisibly gliding between doorways through the gutters. I see that dereliction can survive in opulence; the abundantly wealthy with destitution in their stare.</p><p>Spurred by Amy's death, I've tried to salvage unwilling victims from the mayhem of the internal storm and I am always, always, just pulled inside myself. I have a friend so beautiful, so haunted by talent that you can barely look away from her, whose smile is such a treasure that I have often squandered my sanity for a moment in its glow. Her story is so galling that no one would condemn her for her dependency on illegal anesthesia, but now, even though her life is trying to turn around despite her, even though she has genuine opportunities for a new start, the gutter&nbsp;will not release its prey. The gutter is within. It is frustrating to watch. It is frustrating to love someone with this disease.</p><p>A friend of mine's brother cannot stop drinking. He gets a few months of sobriety and his inner beauty, with the obstacles of his horrible drunken behaviour pushed aside by the presence of a programme, begins to radiate. His family bask relieved, in the joy of their returned loved one, his life gathers momentum but then he somehow forgets the price of this freedom, returns to his old way of thinking, picks up a drink and Mr Hyde is back in the saddle. Once more his brother's face is gaunt and hopeless. His family blame themselves and wonder what they could have done differently, racking their minds for a perfect sentiment; wrapped up in the perfect sentence, a&nbsp;magic bullet to sear right through the toxic fortress that has incarcerated the person they love and restore them to sanity. The fact is, though, that they can't, the sufferer must, of course, be a willing participant in their own recovery. They&nbsp;must not pick up a drink or drug, one day at a time. Just don't pick up, that's all.</p><p>It is difficult to feel sympathy for these people. It is difficult to regard some bawdy drunk and see them as sick&nbsp;and powerless. It is difficult to suffer the selfishness of a drug addict who will lie to you and steal from you and forgive them and offer them help. Can there be any other disease that renders its victims so unappealing? Would Great Ormond Street be so attractive a cause if its beds were riddled&nbsp;with obnoxious little criminals that had \"brought it on themselves\"?</p><p>Peter Hitchens is a vocal adversary of mine on this matter. He sees this condition as a matter of choice and the culprits as criminals who should go to prison. I know how he feels. I bet I have to deal with a lot more drug addicts than he does, let's face it. I share my brain with one, and I can tell you firsthand, they are total fucking wankers. Where I differ from Peter is in my belief that if you regard alcoholics and drug addicts not as bad people but as sick people then we can help them to get better. By we, I mean other people who have the same problem but have found a way to live drug-and-alcohol-free lives. Guided by principles and traditions a programme has been founded that has worked miracles in millions of lives. Not just the alcoholics and addicts themselves but their families, their friends and of course society as a whole.</p><p>What we want to do with Give It Up is popularise a compassionate perception of drunks and addicts, and provide funding for places at treatment centres where they can get clean using these principles. Then, once they are drug-and-alcohol-free, to make sure they retain contact with the support that is available to keep them clean. I&nbsp;know that as you read this you either identify with it yourself or are reminded of someone who you love who cannot exercise control over substances. I want you to know that the help that was available to me, the help upon which my&nbsp;recovery still depends is available.</p><p>I wound down the hill in an alien land, Morrissey chanted lonely mantras, the pain quickly accumulated incalculably, and I began to weave the familiar tapestry that tells an old, old story. I think of places I could score. Off&nbsp;Santa Monica there's a homeless man who I know uses gear. I could find&nbsp;him, buy him a bag if he takes me&nbsp;to&nbsp;score.</p><p>I leave him on the corner, a couple of rocks, a couple of $20 bags pressed into my sweaty palm. I get home, I pull out the foil, neatly torn. I break the bottom off a Martell miniature. I have cigarettes, using makes me need fags. I make a pipe for the rocks with the bottle. I lay a&nbsp;strip of foil on the counter to chase the brown. I pause to reflect and regret that I don't know how to fix, only smoke, feeling inferior even in the manner of my using. I see the foil scorch. I hear the crackle from which crack gets it's name. I feel the plastic fog hit the back of my yawning throat. Eyes up. Back relaxing, the bottle drops and the greedy bliss eats my pain. There is no girl, there is no tomorrow, there is nothing but the bilious kiss of the greedy bliss.</p><p>Even as I spin this beautifully dreaded web, I am reaching for my phone. I call someone: not a doctor or a sage, not a mystic or a physician, just a bloke like me, another alcoholic, who I know knows how I feel. The phone rings and I half hope he'll just let it ring out. It's 4am in London. He's asleep, he can't hear the phone, he won't pick up. I indicate left, heading to Santa Monica. The ringing stops, then the dry mouthed&nbsp;nocturnal mumble: \"Hello. You&nbsp;all right mate?\"</p><p>He picks up.</p><p>And for another day, thank God, I&nbsp;don't have to.</p><p><em>• Red Nose Day is on Friday 15 March.

The Serb will skipper the Red Devils until the end of the season.</p><p>\"He has been a brilliant servant for Manchester United,\" Moyes added. \"He is captain and it will remain that way until the end of the season. He has been a great player for us and we will continue using him.\"</p><p>Moyes confirmed that Jonny Evans will miss Sunday's home game against Fulham with a calf injury he suffered against Stoke. Phil Jones, who came off with concussion against the Potters, could be fit, however.</p><p>Marouane Fellaini's bad luck with injuries continues as he has suffered a groin injury and will be out for a week, Moyes added.</p><p>This weekend will be the first time that Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen has come back to Old Trafford since leaving the United coaching staff in the summer.</p><p>Moyes opted to bring in a number of his own staff when he replaced Sir Alex Ferguson as manager. The former Everton boss revealed he was sad to see the Dutch coach leave United, however.</p><p>\"Rene helped me when I first came here,\" Moyes said. \"I had several conversations with him. He helped me, told me about the club, how it runs and the players.</p><p>\"In the end I would have liked him to stay at the time but he wanted to go and that was fine. I am looking forward to getting Rene back and seeing him.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429175073|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|d67a00e9046a43c632aeeff4dab71916767d83a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>The oldest human footprints ever found outside Africa, left in a muddy river estuary 800,000 years ago, have been discovered in Norfolk by scientists from the British Museum and other national museums and universities.</p><p>The prints were left by a small group of people heading south across the estuary at Happisburgh, through a landscape where mammoths, hippos and rhinoceros grazed. Scientists believe they were a group of adults and children, including one with a foot size the equivalent of a modern size 8 shoe, suggesting a man about 1.7 metres (5ft 7ins) tall.</p><p>The footprints are the first direct evidence of the earliest known humans in northern Europe, previously revealed only by the stone tools and animal bones they left scattered.</p><p>Within a fortnight of the discovery last May, the sea tides that had exposed the footprints destroyed them, on one of the fastest eroding parts of the East Anglian coast. However, <a href=\" http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/featured_project_happisburgh.aspx\" title=\"\">Nick Ashton of the British Museum</a> and other scientists managed to record them before they vanished, including taking casts of some of the best-preserved prints.</p><p>\"This is an extraordinarily rare discovery,\" Ashton said. \"The Happisburgh site continues to rewrite our understanding of the early human occupation of Britain and indeed of Europe.\"</p><p>As winter storms batter the coast, the scientists hope that further erosion may expose more footprints.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429157117'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391773387866/The-size-of-the-Happisbur-011.jpg' alt='The size of the Happisburgh footprints compared to a camera lens cap' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The size of the Happisburgh footprints compared to a camera lens cap.\n Photograph: Martin Bates</figcaption></figure><p>Last May, when the sea scoured away a layer of beach sand and exposed the prints, the scientists immediately believed the long oval hollows were from a prehistoric layer. \"At first we weren't sure what we were seeing,\" Ashton said, \"but as we removed any remaining beach sand and sponged off the seawater, it was clear that the hollows resembled prints, perhaps human footprints, and that we needed to record the surface as quickly as possible before the sea eroded it away.\"</p><p>Photogrammetry, which combines photographs to create a 3D image, confirmed that they were indeed footprints, perhaps of five individuals. Some were clear enough to show heel, arch and toes – allowing an estimate of the height of the individuals at 0.9-1.7 metres.</p><p>The footprints were dated from the geology, lying beneath later glacial deposits and the fossil remains of extinct animals, which Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum, has identified as including mammoth, an extinct type of horse and an early form of vole.</p><p>On the day the small group walked across the wet mud, Britain was still joined to continental Europe. Their river valley, surrounded by coniferous forest, with saltmarsh and freshwater pools, offered a rich variety of food, including edible plants and seaweed, shellfish and animals for meat.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429157118'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391773563848/Footprints-from-Area-A-at-009.jpg' alt='Footprints from Area A at Happisburgh, Norfolk' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Footprints from Area A at Happisburgh, Norfolk. Photograph: Happisburgh Project</figcaption></figure><p>So far no fossil remains of the humans have been found. Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum, an expert on early man, believes they were related to people from Atapuerca in Spain described as <em>Homo antecessor</em>, pioneer man. He believes they became extinct in Europe, perhaps replaced by another early human species, <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>, then by Neanderthals from around 400,000 years ago and finally by modern humans.</p><p>The oldest hominid prints ever found, at Laetoli  in Tanzania, are about 3.5 million years old, while those found at Lleret in Kenya in 2009 – of people who seem to have walked erect and with a similar gait to modern humans – have been dated to around 1.5 million years ago.</p><p>The Norfolk tracks are more than twice the age of the previous oldest found in Europe. Those, left in volcanic ash in the Campanian plain of southern Italy, were nicknamed the Devil's Footprints because they appeared to the modern residents to have been left in solid rock, and have been dated to around 345,000 years.</p><p>The oldest footprints in the Americas – some found in the Mexican desert in 1961, followed by further examples discovered last year – are dated to about 10,500 years.</p><p>The Happisburgh project has been running for more than 10 years. The discoveries of the team form part of a new exhibition opening next week at the Natural History Museum, <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/britain-million-years/\" title=\"\">Britain: One Million Years of the Human Story</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429146385|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|88199e7de964294496af5a8db0489962ff082da6 -->",

        "body":"<p>On a Monday in January, I visited the front page&nbsp;of <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com\" title=\"\">the social news site Reddit</a> to learn that, very occasionally, lobsters are pulled from the sea that are both orange and blue, the colours dividing in a neat line along the spine. Bottles of 7Up are used to contain a mood drug called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_citrate\" title=\"\">lithium citrate</a>. Somebody pointed out that, to&nbsp;get&nbsp;drinking glasses properly clean, it was best&nbsp;to use Sellotape to remove smudges. An&nbsp;eight-year-old girl had been detained wearing a suicide vest in Afghanistan, and there was a photograph of a commuter reading a tantric sex&nbsp;guide on the tube.</p><p>Like many people, around 7m on this particular Monday, I look in on reddit.com often, to see what happens to be capturing the imagination of this vast online community at any&nbsp;given moment. The people who run Reddit&nbsp;call it \"the front page of the internet\", bravado they can back up because more than 100&nbsp;million unique users visit every month. A&nbsp;link&nbsp;that appears on Reddit's front page, sparely&nbsp;rendered in blue <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana\" title=\"\">Verdana</a> on a white background, will send traffic stampeding wherever it points. <a href=\"http://gawker.com\" title=\"\">Gawker</a>, an influential online voice in its own right, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web\" title=\"\">has called Reddit \"the single dominant force in internet culture today\"</a>.</p><p>\"It's unpredictable, and that's powerful,\" Reddit's general manager, Erik Martin, told me. Martin runs the site with three dozen colleagues out of a cluttered office in San Francisco: pot plants, postcards, blinds drawn against the sun. \"When I&nbsp;rolled up this morning and checked on Reddit, I&nbsp;had no idea what was going to be on the front page. And I think that's rarer and rarer. If I go on Facebook, or Twitter, or Google News, I basically know what I'm going to see. But on Reddit…\"</p><p>But on Reddit there might be <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1ujhte/1_in_50_million_amazing/\" title=\"\">an item about&nbsp;multicoloured lobsters</a>. The site is an  ever-revising digest of distraction, dealing in new&nbsp;news and old, intriguing facts; in pictures, videos, songs; in broad jokes, subtle jokes, in-jokes; in questions, answers, hypotheticals; in contradictions, the scandalous rubbing up against the mawkish, trifles muddled with real outrages; in photos of babies, sloths, baby sloths – all of it sloshes through, 70,000 daily posts in Reddit's 6,500 forums, sorted by the community so the best contributions rise to become most visible.</p><p>Users vote. They click on arrows to push (say) a&nbsp;picture of a giant gingerbread statue up or down.&nbsp;Enough \"up votes\" and the link will rise in&nbsp;prominence, perhaps to the front page, where&nbsp;visitors are confronted by the 25 most popular posts of the moment. It was here that I&nbsp;learned of the death of Nelson Mandela. I also read about <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1u75hh/_/\" title=\"\">a man who claimed to have two penises</a> and wept with laughter at <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1a33mb/\" title=\"\">an animated gif&nbsp;of people very intently dancing to electro house</a>. I lost a night's sleep to <a href=\"http://en.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1prjos/bad_car_crash_in_russia_today/\" title=\"\">explicit footage of a&nbsp;Russian car crash</a>.</p><p>Now it was January, a time for resolution, and I&nbsp;planned to stop lurking on the fringes of Reddit.&nbsp;Instead, I'd take part, get an account and post something. Would it be possible to get to the&nbsp;rarefied ground of the front page? I spoke to&nbsp;some&nbsp;of the site's more successful contributors for advice.</p><p>It is thought bad form on Reddit to reveal your real name, and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Shitty_Watercolour\" title=\"\">a user going by the name Shitty_Watercolour</a> would not, except to say that he was&nbsp;an undergraduate at the University of York. \"After a&nbsp;while you get a feel for what does well,\" he said, suggesting I focus on \"quick, easily digestible content\". <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/theNYEHHH\" title=\"\">A user called THENYEHHH</a>, this confusing name no barrier to her gathering thousands of votes for her contributions, told me&nbsp;to keep content light, lively: \"For the most part, everyone is just trying to have a good time.\"</p><p>The front page, as Monday evening approached, featured a picture of a cat sitting upright on its owner's lap to eat. Beneath it was <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ugn4h/eli5_why_dont_we_get_goosebumps_on_our_face/\" title=\"\">an explanation of the science behind goosebumps</a> and a trailer for the new series of House Of Cards. The American comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jerry-seinfeld\" title=\"\">Jerry Seinfeld</a> had offered himself up to be interviewed by Reddit users, as had <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ui9v9/iam_siri_awardwinning_porn_star_2013_top_writer/\" title=\"\">a porn actor</a>. While Seinfeld discussed coffee blends and models of car, the porn actor fielded questions on the importance of&nbsp;good microphone positioning. She revealed an&nbsp;out-of-hours liking for Harry Potter and a&nbsp;secret talent for the mandolin. I&nbsp;was so taken by this last revelation, I&nbsp;borrowed it for my username.</p><p>Logged in as <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/TalentForMandolin\" title=\"\">TalentForMandolin</a>, I&nbsp;copied and pasted a link to an old&nbsp;news story from the BBC's website: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ujwzh/til_a_surprise_inspection_of_a_mens_prison_in/\" title=\"\">a men's prison in Mexico had been subjected to a surprise inspection in&nbsp;2011</a>, where guards had found plasma TVs and sacks of&nbsp;marijuana in the cells, also a couple of peacocks, 100 fighting hens and 25 women. I thought this&nbsp;was weird and punchy enough to get some attention. I wrote a new headline for&nbsp;the story&nbsp;and pressed submit.</p><p>Some people have earned a lot of money through Reddit. In 2011, a user mused as to what might happen if a Roman legion fought America's modern military, and he wound up with a six-figure sum to write a screenplay on the subject. Others have earned just enough, for instance the struggling manufacturer of stained glass who put out a plea for custom at the end of 2013. (\"Your support saved my little business,\" SenatorMars told the community.) Reddit's two founders are millionaires.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429155923'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391521431048/Arthur-Chiverton-illustra-012.jpg' alt='Arthur Chiverton illustration for Reddit feature ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'When I rolled up this morning and checked on Reddit, I had no idea what was going to be on the front page.

Illustration: Arthur Chiverton </figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman\" title=\"\">Steve Huffman</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian\" title=\"\">Alexis Ohanian</a> became friends the day they moved in to student halls at&nbsp;the University of Virginia. \"Steve wasn't so excited to meet me,\" Ohanian recalled. \"He'd seen my name on my door and thought I'd&nbsp;be a girl.\" Huffman studied computer science,&nbsp;Ohanian history and commerce. Before graduating in 2005, they decided to start a&nbsp;company. Ohanian says, \"I&nbsp;wanted us to be able to live like college students for as long as we could.\"</p><p>They spent months on a piece of software that would help people avoid queues in fast-food restaurants. It bombed in a meeting with investors, at which point they rushed together a&nbsp;new idea, \"like a top 40 for interesting content\", as they pitched it. Huffman admits to being light-fingered in the early days. He and Ohanian pinched the voting concept from a technology news site called Slashdot. From Slashdot, too, they spun off the idea of users collecting \"karma\" – brownie points, essentially, and worthless – in return for making beneficial contributions. Reddit's pared-down aesthetic \"was copied almost entirely\" from a bookmarking site called Delicious. Over a boiling summer, the friends sat at facing computers, listened to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gwenstefani\" title=\"\">Gwen Stefani</a> and built Reddit.</p><p>\"We were lean,\" said Ohanian, who recalled eating little but hummus that summer. It was a&nbsp;phrase echoed by Reddit's general manager, Erik Martin, when I spoke to him by phone from San Francisco. \"We're lean,\" he said of Reddit's 35-person staff. In 2014, the site looks almost as stark and unattractive as it did when it launched in 2005. This, Martin explained, allowed Reddit to continue growing (5bn page views last month) while keeping maintenance costs low.</p><p>These days, Reddit is a part of Advance Publications, which owns Condé Nast. Huffman and Ohanian, now 30, sold their creation in 2006. \"Life-changing wealth,\" Ohanian called it, or <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/10/31/what-is-reddit-worth/\" title=\"\">$5m by industry estimates</a>. Roughly speaking, Reddit has doubled in size every year since. It is yet to make a profit, \"but we're not that far off\", Martin said.</p><p>Given its eight years under corporate ownership, it's near miraculous that Reddit's verve, the unruliness that makes it appealing to so many, has survived. \"Condé Nast realised pretty early they're not a technology company,\" Ohanian said. (He still serves on the Reddit board.) \"They gave Reddit a&nbsp;ton of autonomy.\" Martin called Advance Publications \"extremely hands-off\".</p><p>Huffman has a different stance. He&nbsp;was kept on&nbsp;to run Reddit after its 2006 acquisition and launched the company's San&nbsp;Francisco office. Huffman found Reddit's ownership stifling and told me&nbsp;that by the end of his time at the company he wasn't on speaking terms with the then-president of Condé Nast Digital. One day&nbsp;on Reddit, the joke of the moment – there's always one – had been <a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090821/0213555950.shtml\" title=\"\">to mock the retail giant Sears</a>, a big advertiser with Condé Nast. Sears complained, according to Huffman, who says he was told to remove certain posts, and eventually gave in. \"I've still never forgiven them.\" Huffman left the company in 2009 and now runs <a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com\" title=\"\">a travel website, Hipmunk</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429155924'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391523344555/Arthur-Chiverton-illustra-008.jpg' alt='Arthur Chiverton illustration for Reddit feature' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'Reddit is a snapshot of humanity, with all the beautiful parts and all the ugly parts intact.' Illustration: Arthur Chiverton for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Martin told me that content is very rarely taken off Reddit. \"There's only a handful of rules. Most of the time the moderators of the community remove [rule-breaking posts] before we even know&nbsp;about it. There are sometimes grey areas, edge cases, that we have to consider. But most of&nbsp;the time it's clear cut. Anything illegal is removed pretty quickly.\"</p><p>A forum called Jailbait, where users were encouraged to post pictures of underage girls, was&nbsp;banned in 2011; another called Creepshots, for secretly taken photographs of women, went, too. There are, however, plenty of Reddit forums&nbsp;remaining that cause unease in the wider community. (One user I spoke to cited a forum called SexyAbortions.) On a site that has a male-female balance of around 65%-35%, many find there's too much breezy misogyny for comfort. \"Genuinely disappointing,\" Shitty_Watercolour called it.</p><p>\"There is certainly a dark side to Reddit,\" Huffman said. \"You get it all.\" People sometimes confess to crimes on these boards – even murder, last year, which triggered a police investigation as&nbsp;well as mainstream media coverage. Unflattering headlines were made shortly after the Boston bombings, too, when an innocent man&nbsp;was identified and vilified on Reddit as the person responsible. \"Reddit is a&nbsp;snapshot of humanity, with all the&nbsp;beautiful parts and all the ugly parts intact,\" Huffman says.</p><p>Actually, given that people exist here anonymously, the site can seem a surprisingly affectionate and judicious place. It's a benefit of the voting system, which influences comments as&nbsp;well, so that ill-natured or illiterate remarks tend to&nbsp;be voted away out of sight. The&nbsp;comments under an average YouTube video might have been written by a different species. Unlike Facebook or&nbsp;Twitter, Reddit isn't dominated by the most tireless contributors. It's quite witty, quite warm.</p><p>Users I interviewed counselled me against trying to personify Reddit, to reduce it to this or&nbsp;that way of thinking. The community, it was pointed out, consisted of \"homeless people to rich people, fast-food employees to doctors, agoraphobes to adventurers\". Even so, it's possible to single out conspicuous leanings. Reddit is leftwing, irreligious, extremely keen on the actors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-stewart\" title=\"\">Patrick Stewart</a>. A spirit of contrarianism runs deep. In 2010, when a moderator put up a test post with the instruction \"<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/\" title=\"\">please ignore</a>\", it received more than 20,000 votes and became Reddit's most popular post of all time. The top comment underneath read: \"Don't tell me what to do.\"</p><p>My post about the Mexican prison was rising.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ujvrg/jerry_seinfeld_here_i_will_give_you_an_answer/\" title=\"\">Seinfeld's interview</a> now topped the front page. Underneath him was the House Of Cards trailer and a question about what would happen if <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ujkdn/eli5_what_would_happen_if_one_the_worlds_super/\" title=\"\">China \"randomly\" invaded New Zealand</a>. There was <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ujclv/10_books_written_in_the_1940s_we_love_even_more/\" title=\"\">a post about worthwhile novels written in the 1940s</a> and a video of a zookeeper masturbating a&nbsp;monkey. When <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ujwzh/til_a_surprise_inspection_of_a_mens_prison_in/\" title=\"\">my Mexican prison story</a> pushed on to the front page, just after 8pm, it nudged off a cartoon about the weather in Australia.</p><p>I hadn't expected this. Plunging into the comments, I had to ask: wasn't it supposed to be&nbsp;hard to get to the front page? \"One in a million,&nbsp;my friend,\" I was told. Someone else responded: \"Meh, I've been there four times. It's&nbsp;no big.\" <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/aftli\" title=\"\">A&nbsp;veteran user called Aftli</a>, who'd signed up for Reddit seven years ago, said one in a&nbsp;million was an&nbsp;exaggeration, but \"it's pretty hard to do\". And&nbsp;by the way, he added, \"prepare for soul-crushing disappointment with the next 30 links you submit\". A user called <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/toilet_crusher\" title=\"\">Toilet_Crusher</a> was conciliatory. \"Your post's been seen worldwide for&nbsp;sure!\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429155925'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391524149635/Arthur-Chiverton-illustra-008.jpg' alt='Arthur Chiverton illustration of Sir David Attenborough for Reddit feature' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sir David Attenborough took questions about mass extinction and shampooing during his Reddit AskMeAnything interview. Illustration: Arthur Chiverton for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Martin told me that one of Reddit's great&nbsp;strengths was that it&nbsp;was both intimate and&nbsp;enormous. \"You put something out in the universe and get a response. That response might be one comment. Or that response might put you on talkshows the next day.\" Ohanian said: \"I like measuring things in New York City. We had 100m unique visitors last month. That's more than 12&nbsp;New York Cities' worth of&nbsp;people. Mind-blowing!\"</p><p>It's why the famous are more and more likely to appear on Reddit. Not&nbsp;just Seinfeld; <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mj1yl/amaa_ask_madonna_almost_anything/\" title=\"\">Madonna came on&nbsp;last summer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16mq0g/iamarnold_ask_me_anything/\" title=\"\">Arnold Schwarzenegger in early 2013</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/\" title=\"\">Barack Obama in 2012</a>. In Reddit terminology, where forums are known as \"subreddits\", and \"karma\" points are discussed as though of real monetary value, these interviews are called \"AskMeAnythings\". Correctly so, because Reddit will ask anything.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000208/\" title=\"\">Molly Ringwald</a>, was it true that on the set of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847/\" title=\"\">The Breakfast Club</a> you were bullied by<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\" title=\"\"> Judd Nelson</a>? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/woody-harrelson\" title=\"\">Woody Harrelson</a>, did your dad used to be a&nbsp;contract killer? Molly answered (in the affirmative); Woody didn't. AskMeAnythings don't always work, but when they do, they're wonderful. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1uqlmf/i_am_sir_david_attenborough_im_on_reddit_ama/\" title=\"\">Sir David Attenborough took questions about mass extinction as well as his shampooing regime</a>. When Shitty_Watercolour, who chose that name for a reason, painted a shitty watercolour as a gift for Attenborough and put it online, there was talk of printing, framing… Schwarzenegger enjoyed his Reddit interview so much he still drops by to post. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mob6q/joseph_gordonlevitt_are_we_recording_ask_me/\" title=\"\">So does the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>.</p><p>While my story about Mexican prisons was prospering – now at No5, No4 – Gordon-Levitt came online to put up a link. It quickly rose into&nbsp;the top 10 and together we made our assault&nbsp;on Seinfeld in the top spot. I found it absurdly exciting, Seinfeld in New York, Gordon-Levitt in California, me at my kitchen table, holding the collective attention of the internet for&nbsp;15 minutes or so.</p><p>It fell apart. Our power alliance crumbled. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1uj9q7/a_gopro_camera_attached_to_a_crab_net_produces/\" title=\"\">A&nbsp;video about crab fishing</a> became Reddit's new favourite item. Gordon-Levitt lodged at No7 and did not move further. Seinfeld dropped down a&nbsp;place. I fell off the front page altogether.</p><p>In the days that followed, the prediction by my new friend Aftli – that I would face disappointment with my next posts – proved true. I put up an item about collective nouns and a biographical fact about Bruce Willis, to no response. I tried being edgy, with a joke about Hitler, and being cute, with a picture of a baby reading a&nbsp;newspaper on a&nbsp;bus. Reddit was indifferent.</p><p>This community wouldn't be told what to think, what to click; their 20m daily votes couldn't be lobbied for. When I asked Martin if he was ever courted by companies who wanted to harness the site's awesome traffic, he said, \"People who know Reddit know that we certainly don't, uh...\" He paused, to chuckle. \"Nobody tells Reddit what to&nbsp;pay attention to.\"</p><p>Huffman insisted that from its earliest days he'd programmed Reddit to be resistant to anyone trying to \"game\" their way up the rankings. \"Half of Reddit's source code was dedicated to catching bad content and users cheating.\" I was able to confirm this first-hand when I was banned from posting, temporarily, my contributions by now so terribly unsuccessful I was marked as a potential spammer. The&nbsp;Mexican prison story, which had peaked at No2, generated enough fresh traffic for&nbsp;the BBC to make this two-year-old item its most popular Latin American news story of the day. It had been voted on by 16,246 Reddit users. My subsequent posts, added up, got a grand total of 140. Which hurt.</p><p>Tell me about it, consoled Aftli, who still felt bruised by the failure of a forum he'd once tried to&nbsp;found, about interesting cash registers. Aftli advised me to forget about the front page. \"For me, and I think for most Redditors, the site is more about the discussion than the links that are posted.\" Huffman agreed – making the top 25 wasn't the point. \"I guess there are individuals who feel like they're competing, and they've won something [if they get there], but in reality they're part of something much larger.\"</p><p>Martin advised me to try looking \"at the part of&nbsp;the iceberg that's underwater\". Ohanian also suggested I venture deeper. Why not start with his favourite forum, called <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms\" title=\"\">BirdsWithArms</a>? So&nbsp;I&nbsp;did, and spent a happy half-hour clicking through Photoshopped pictures of owls holding tobacco pipes, canaries brandishing swords. Then I dug about and found <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1upvhz/if_inanimate_objects_had_personalities_who_would/\" title=\"\">a fascinating debate about which inanimate object was the bigger \"asshole\"</a>, the printer or the automatic sink? On Aftli's advice I tried <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/\" title=\"\">ForwardsFromGrandma</a>. I watched a&nbsp;thread develop in which <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/comments/1uo6xf\" title=\"\">a woman admitted she was dreading her own wedding</a>, mortified at the thought of her fiance's family seeing how few friends she had. Slowly, as commenters pieced together where and when the service was taking place, people offered to come along and fill seats.</p><p>\"The community is where the real value is at,\" Huffman said. \"Since very, very early on, Reddit has had a soul.\"</p><p>It was a Wednesday and Huffman, like me, had spent hours riveted to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1uq5bw/iam_michael_franzese_a_former_made_boss_in_the/\" title=\"\">the on-site confessions of a&nbsp;former mob boss</a>, who spoke of initiation rituals&nbsp;and his grandma's meatballs. Elsewhere, advice was sought about how to turn the pages of&nbsp;a 340-year-old Bible. Tongs or spatula? A&nbsp;Starbucks barista admitted intentionally misspelling teenagers' names, so they couldn't post pictures of their cups on Instagram. Later, a&nbsp;Reddit staffer put up a note to announce that the&nbsp;site would be taken offline, briefly, for maintenance. A user posted a two-word response that seemed to sum up the popular mood.</p><p>\"Now what?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/428876050|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|ed30cd6e7611e38cacc774e07ceab95a9f079395 -->",

        "body":"<p>12 Years A Slave, the drama following the unjust enslavement of a free man in antebellum America, is the first to pass Indian censors for full-frontal nudity. It was originally to have nine cuts made to it, but a review found the nude scenes to be \"necessary\" and kept them in \"based on merit\".</p><p>The film's director Steve McQueen <a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-censor-board-breaks-free-of-nudity-barriers-1958095\">celebrated the decision</a> in an interview with Indian newspaper DNA. \"As a filmmaker, I needed to see the lashes on the back. I needed to see the pyschological effect afterward. If I hadn't done that, I would have done a disservice because that evidence had to be shown. The lynching had to be depicted in the best possible manner because it happened to hundreds of thousands of people. As someone whose ancestors experienced it, I needed to do it the way I did it.\"</p><p>The censor board's spokesperson Anjum Rajabali told DNA: \"12 Years A Slave was given clearance based on merit after it was felt that the scenes were necessary and that cutting them would take away from the film itself. However, this does not mean a blanket approval for nudity in adult-only films.\" The chair of the board, Leela Samson, said the preservation of the film was in keeping with a gradual change in Indian values. \"This board has always interpreted certification guidelines in the most sensitive, liberal and progressive way, reflecting the maturing sensibilities of our audiences,\" she said. </p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-426386730\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/06/14010612Years-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/06/14010612Years_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/06/14010612Years_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/06//14010612Years.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/06/14010612Years/14010612Years.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/12-years-a-slave-first-us-film-to-have-fullfrontal-nudity-cleared-by-indias-censor-board-9112932.html\">an interview</a> with the Hindustan Times, Indian filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said: \"The argument is that their culture is different from ours, so we should respect that and let their scenes go as they are.

        "headline":"Journey to the heart of the house price bubble",
        "body":"<p>There is an awkward moment when estate agent Rory Atkins opens the door to a two-bedroom ground floor flat, hidden behind a discouraging cafe, to reveal a dark corridor where he finds three brown spirals of dog excrement on the carpet. \"It's not ideal. He's done a little mess,\" he says apologetically, stepping over the droppings and leading the potential buyer, who is already looking downcast, into the kitchen.</p><p>It is not a positive viewing. The hopeful buyer is quickly realising how little she can afford in a part of London where she has lived for the past decade. This flat, which is marketed as having a bright, secluded courtyard garden, has a tiny, dark patch of paved external space, barely wide enough to stretch out your arms. The tenant, who has left her spaniel alone in the flat, has discarded belongings on every surface, leaving an explosion of tangled clothes, odd boots, bottles of hair dye, socks, sunglasses, loo-paper rolls, DVDs, all thrown on to the bed and the floor. ; it is a scene of unusually intense squalor.</p><p>For a while the buyer tries to be positive and cranes to see the flat's potential, but is ultimately defeated by the bedroom that has no windows. The flat (described as an \"ideal first-time purchase or rental investment\") is not close to any tube or railway station, but is priced at £299,000.</p><p>The average cost of a home in the east London borough of Hackney exceeded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/29/house-prices-hackney-london-average-half-million-pounds\" title=\"\">£500,000 for the first time in December</a>, as the area recorded the steepest year-on-year rise in prices in England and Wales last year. But a similar trend can be seen across London and the south-east. This week, forecaster Ernst &amp; Young warned that \"bubble-like\" conditions were emerging in London, with prices in the capital up 11.6%, year-on-year in November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/02/london-property-market-bubble-cool-down-ey-item-club\" title=\"\">over double the national average rise of 5.4%</a>. For people trying to buy somewhere to live, the new price surge makes house hunting an exceptionally stressful process, as three days spent with a Hackney-based estate agency reveals.</p><p>\"It's a nightmare,\" the prospective buyer says. She examines a red bucket placed under a skylight and considers whether it is there to catch a leak. \"I've been living in Hackney for 10 years. When I moved here I paid £350 a month in rent, now I pay £1,000. It's not sustainable to live in rented accommodation.\"</p><p>She knows she is lucky to have been left some money to help her buy a flat, but doesn't feel very lucky when she sees what her budget stretches to and as she realises that prices are rising week by week. Trying to buy somewhere to live in London quickly makes people who previously considered themselves well-off, feel poor. \"Most of the places I've seen are shitholes.\"</p><p>She wonders if the price is \"a bit ambitious\", but Atkins explains the flat has already had a sale agreed at around the asking price before Christmas, but the sale fell through. She says she will think about it. \"It's about working out if I could live in a place which doesn't have any windows.\" Within a week, estate agents have found another buyer who is happy to pay an undisclosed sum, only a little below the asking price.</p><p>House price rises in London are nothing new, but the sharp increase in Hackney in the last year has startled agents, buyers and sellers. The process of buying somewhere to live here has become increasingly anguished, particularly for first-time buyers, coming into the market with nothing of their own to sell. Local agents now find it more efficient to sell houses by organising open days on Saturdays, when dozens of potential buyers are shepherded through the doors, during two-hour-long appointment windows, and encouraged to make their minds up by Monday morning.</p><p>On the last Saturday in January, Keatons, a London agents with a large Hackney office, organised seven open house viewings. By Monday night, buyers had been found for four of them, and offers had been made on two more, leaving only one flat with no instant buyer, but several second viewings arranged.</p><p>Open days feel particularly fraught at the (relatively) cheaper end of the spectrum, where the level of anxiety is acute. Thirty-five separate viewings have been booked, beginning at midday on Saturday, for a sunny but otherwise unremarkable two-bedroom top floor mansion block flat, overlooking a main road and on the market at £400,000.</p><p>Potential buyers brush past each other, politely, tapping at the fireplaces, scraping their nails suspiciously over the plaster, peering into cupboards and listening to the creaking floorboards; couples retreat to the corners to mutter at each other. It feels like an uncomfortable drinks party, guests crushed in but reluctant to make conversation, studying the decor in awkward silence.</p><p>Everyone who comes in is white, and in their late 20s and 30s, unless they are older parents accompanying their children; this demographic is repeated at each of the nine viewings and open days that Keatons allows us to attend over three days.</p><p>Housebuying angst in Hackney is a uniquely middle-class phenomenon. Research released by HSBC this week showed that of first-time buyers who bought in 2012, 64% received financial help from their parents. Hackney agents say parents, helping their children with a lump sum to get them on the ladder, are partly responsible for the sharp price rise.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429190149'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391719711608/Potential-buyers-wait-to--008.jpg' alt='Potential buyers wait to view a house' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Agents insist that open days are a practical and efficient way of dealing with the rising demand. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Tarik Ali, another Keatons agent, says all his buyers are \"relatively affluent, middle class people\". \"They're often supported by the bank of mum and dad; they may have an inheritance or parents who have remortgaged the equity on their house,\" he say. \"Parents who have got large savings are giving money to their children to help them get on the ladder, because they are not getting any interest on their savings.\"</p><p>There is a mood of despondent resignation, shared by most buyers, trooping to the viewings. Rebecca Scott, 29, a fashion designer, who has her parents with her for moral support, thinks she has seen about 20 places already. \"It's depressing. You think that it is going to be fun looking for your first place to live, but it's more like a chore,\" she says.</p><p>Like many, Chloe Pursey, 28, a digital publisher, wonders if the open house policy is designed to \"freak you out\". \"It's like making people queue outside a nightclub to make you feel it's popular. You feel you have no option but to put in your highest offer.\" She is bemused by the number of cash buyers. \"Where are all these people coming from with £575,000 in their pocket?\"</p><p>Jenny Howard, 35, who works in advertising, agrees: \"It is a game so that you panic. You're made to feel that you have about four minutes to decide whether to drop half a million pounds. It's clever psychology to make you think, 'if there are lots of people here, it must be nice'. It's easier for the agents – this way they don't have to do appointments and drive you around.\"</p><p>By the end of the session, the two Keatons estate agents who have been guiding people in and out think that at least two people will pay the asking price. In the end, five offers are made on Monday, ranging from £405,000 to £454,000.</p><p>The agents insist that open days are a practical and efficient way of dealing with the rising demand, pointing out that most buyers are busy during the weekdays, and at this time of year it is too dark to look at houses properly after work. It also works well for sellers, because the process of selling a house is speeded up. \"While the market is so barmy, so many owners want us to release their houses for open days on Saturday,\" head of Keatons' Hackney office, Debby Blow, explains.</p><p>There is a persistent refrain of defensiveness from the estate agents, who point out repeatedly that they are not responsible for rising prices, but are simply witnessing the fallout from the fundamental problem of a shortage of stock in London. However, Blow admits that the consequence of these open days, which so often lead to multiple offers made on a Monday, and then sealed bids, decided on Tuesday, is that people are paying over the odds for the available property, and then, when their purchase goes through, instantly setting a new standard for prices in the area, further inflating the boom.</p><p>\"The sealed bids scenario is very worrying,\" she says, although she thinks the system is a more sensible way of resolving competing bids than the gazumping she witnessed five years ago.  She doesn't enjoy overseeing the process.</p><p>\"It is hugely emotional. People think this market is amazing, but when you have five offers on a property, you end up with one delighted person and four devastated people. Buyers have got used to it. Every agent does sealed bids now,\" Blow says. \"It is great for the vendor, except they have to go through the same process when they buy their new home.\"</p><p>She puts the micro-boom in Hackney down to the post-Olympics changes that have transformed an area which once had failing schools and high crime into a part of London appreciated for its architecture, parks and cafes, but which remains just affordable to people no longer able to live more centrally. People no longer able to afford in this part of east London are looking further out in Walthamstow and Leyton. \"We are not pushing the prices up: the buyers are, while demand outweighs supply,\" she adds.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429190150'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391719890967/People-look-around-house-008.jpg' alt='People look around house' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>On the last Saturday in January, Keatons, an agents with a large Hackney office, organised seven open house viewings. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Eighteen people are booked to see a basement and ground floor three-bedroom flat, with limited natural daylight downstairs, priced at £550,000. Liane Wimhurst, 32, a journalist, has been searching on and off for two years with her husband, and makes her way swiftly around with a practised air. They are first-time buyers, both in good jobs, helped with a generous lump of money from family members, but have found the process very difficult, and are constantly moving their search area away from the stretch of north London they originally hoped to live in.</p><p>\"We tried Tufnell Park, but were priced out of there; we were in a bidding war on a couple places in Finsbury Park, but we were priced out of there. We're looking now at places which cost £550,000, when similar properties six months ago were on sale for £400,000. We are flabbergasted. It is difficult to remain positive in a situation like this. The prices that other people are bidding keep taking us by surprise.\"</p><p>She is also concerned about the effect of rising prices on local people, whose rents area rising with property prices. \"What about the people who can't afford the rent? Do they get flushed out of the area? The government response is plodding. I don't think they appreciate the scale of the problem.\" She decides quickly that this flat is not suitable. \"£550,000 when half the flat is in darkness? That is not a recipe for happiness.\"</p><p>Flat-searching is a very intimate experience. The owners here have only just gone out, and their bath mat is still wet. Buyers flick through people's lives, glancing at their sofa choices, their duvet covers, the number of books they own and how recently handled they are, you gauge how ambitious they are in the kitchen. Jon Clifford, 34, quite likes the flat, but is gloomy about the price. \"I mean, it's high … isn't it? It's very high.\" Still, he knows that this is not a time for uncertainty. \"We dawdled on a place before, and it was gone before we made up our mind.\"</p><p>He knows he is in a relatively good position because his own flat has been valued at around 60% higher than the price he bought it for three years ago, but he also feels embarrassed at his own role in the gentrification process of the area he likes. \"Where do the locals go? The pubs have gentrified. It's the speed – it's all happened so fast it's ridiculous. You feel like you're part of the process.\"</p><p>As he talks, another couple look around; they don't want to be interviewed about their house hunt, which has already involved making seven offers, and having seven bids refused, because it makes them too unhappy and angry. There are 24 viewings at a recently decorated two-up two-down three bedroom house, on sale for £730,000. The first viewer is rueful about the price. \"This used to be called Murder Mile. Its brand has totally changed – there's a creperie up the road, but the transport is still shocking.\"</p><p>Lizzy Moore, 38, a graphic designer, who is here with her two small children and husband, searching for somewhere bigger now their youngest has turned one, is sure she saw the same house advertised for sale a year ago for £650,000. \"It's depressing. I don't find this a joyful experience,\" she says, jaundiced by the experience of searching. \"The games they play, causing a frenzy with these viewings. It's embarrassing. But the price? It's probably the going rate – I've watched Clapton go from being affordable to being unaffordable.\" Three mournful tenants, who will have to leave once the house is sold, sit in the kitchen, listening to jazz, watching people trailing through their home.</p><p>The Keatons' office in Hackney is brightly lit, with marble floors and brand new bright orange chairs. The staff are smartly dressed in black and grey, and appear upbeat and enthusiastic about their job, which is lucky since they work surprisingly hard – starting at 9am and finishing later than 7pm most weekdays, and working every Saturday, with only two days off in lieu a month. The huge glass shop front looks out on to Mare Street, a busy Hackney shopping street, showcasing a part of London which is changing as house prices rise, but which remains hugely mixed.</p><p>There is a new dog-walking company around the corner from the offices, and all day pairs of dog minders in green overalls walk dogs, three at a time, to the park. But there are also a lot of older people dragging shopping trolleys, people with unsteady gait who look unwell, humped over walking frames or squeezed into mobility vehicles, and&nbsp;people flimsily-dressed for the January cold.</p><p>These are not people you would see walking down a high street in Kensington. This is the odd thing about the housing boom in Hackney: remarkable prices are being asked for houses that are in areas of the city that still feel quite&nbsp;poor. An elderly man, carrying a clear Tesco's bag full of bleach bottles, stops to look at the houses advertised in the window, pauses for a while, frowns, and moves on.</p><p>The speed of change here is extraordinary. Blow, who has worked for the branch for 13 years, has seen the transformation. \"That kind of dog is new in our borough,\" she says, looking at the uniformed dog-walkers going past. \"A few years ago the dogs were muzzled – pit bulls … now we have dachshunds. People who are working take their dog to the dogminder, like you'd take a child to the childminder – that's new.\"</p><p>She is glad that Hackney is no longer seen as crime-ridden, that the schools have improved so much that her customers do not think about moving when their children turn eight or nine, and that there are more cafes and restaurants, but she is also ambivalent about how quickly it has happened, and how many of the longer-term residents are moving on.</p><p>A woman in a striped woolly hat and trainers comes in for some advice on whether to sell her flat in Stoke Newington, now that the area has, as she puts it, \"done its thing\" (ie appreciated insanely), to invest the money in an area which has not yet gone up in value. \"Should I sell and buy in Walthamstow where there's going to be a higher increase? Or is that crazy? We want to get a period property, do it up, and flip it.\"</p><p>The office has about 50 properties on its lists. What is remarkable when you flick through the printed details is how little you get for the large amount being asked. The cheapest flat is a £130,000 postage stamp-sized bedsit above a shop – 13.7 square metres.</p><p>The most expensive home the office is selling is a Victorian house for £1.5m. It is described as \"magnificent\", but the pictures show a corner building in a dismaying state of disarray. It has damp-wrinkled carpets and ripped purple curtains, the top floor ceiling has collapsed, revealing rib-like wooden struts, and a huge, grimy, white fluffy duck lies among the old children's toys abandoned on the floor.</p><p>Only 15 people are booked to see the final viewing of the day – a neat, flat-fronted two-storey Victorian terraced home, near London Fields – £875,000. A buyer who has flown in from New York to see the house is unflustered by the price and by the crowded viewing conditions. \"It's fine to look with lots of other people. You just have to pretend you don't like it,\" he says. In fact he likes the house. \"Prices have gone up,\" he says, \"but the quality of life has gone up too. It is more gentrified – there are more vegan cafes.\"</p><p>By noon on Monday, five people have offered the asking price, and Blow requests that they each come back with their best offer by 7pm (sealed bids simply involve an email to the agent). A few hours later the owner of the house has accepted an offer of £927,000 from a chain-free cash buyer. That is £52,000 above the asking price.</p><p>• This article was amended on 7 February 2014 to correct a reference to 7pm, from 7am as the original said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/429108563|2014-02-07T16:42:47Z|3d630d65d168e719c357d15954e8251f7b892c5c -->",
