The stockpile has since been secured in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</p><p>The Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli has asked the Libyan authorities to ensure the concentrated uranium is used for the benefit of Libyans, in \"industrial and agricultural development and in the production of clean energy\".</p><p>Gaddafi signed the chemical weapons convention and joined the OPCW in 2004 as part of an ultimately abortive efforts to shake off pariah status and mend relations with the west.</p><p>Libya had 13 tonnes of mustard gas when it signed the treaty but Gaddafi claimed to have destroyed the munitions needed to deliver it. Gaddafi's regime destroyed about 54% of its mustard gas stocks and about 40% of the chemicals used to manufacture the substance, besides 3,500 bombs intended to deliver deadly chemicals.</p><p>The process, supervised by OPCW experts, resumed in 2012. It intensified in September 2013 with the signing of a deal with Washington, which was increasingly concerned that the stockpiles might fall into the hands of ex-rebel militias that the post-Gaddafi government has struggled to contain.</p><p>The Syrian disarmament operation, agreed to by Damascus in 2013 under threat of western military action, is running behind schedule, sparking mounting concern in Washington. Syria has declared around 700 tonnes of the most dangerous chemicals and they were supposed to have been shipped out by 31 December. Another 500 tonnes of less dangerous precursor chemicals are supposed to be shipped out by Wednesday.</p><p>But so far just two small shipments have left the Syrian port of Latakia, accounting for less than 4% of the country's declared arsenal of most dangerous chemicals and none of the precursors. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has warned President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that he could face consequences if he fails to meet his obligations on giving up the weapons.<br></p>","headline":"Libya says chemical weapons destroyed","trailText":"Government says country has been rid of weapons from Gaddafi era in process hailed by monitors as example for Syria <br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"607","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428938889","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f1c992e4b025fe0e2e665b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Agence France-Presse in Tripoli","internalPageCode":"2038364","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T05:36:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","tags":[{"id":"world/libya","webTitle":"Libya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/libya","references":[]},{"id":"world/chemical-weapons","webTitle":"Chemical weapons","description":"The latest news and comment on chemical weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/chemical-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e28d892f-d2a5-4b6f-ac5b-f39498c93df0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","source":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","photographer":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","altText":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.","height":"132","credit":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","caption":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.

Here are the headlines so far.</p><h2>Libya</h2><p>A rebel spokesman said on Friday that a Nato air attack in Zlitan has killed Muammar Gaddafi's son Khamis (left), one of the main commanders of the Libyan leader's military forces. Another 31 people were also killed, the spokesman said. A Nato official at operations headquarters in Naples said he was aware of the report but could not confirm it. There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli government.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368891/Libya-Is-pilot-killed-Gaddafis-son-Khamis-kamikaze-attack.html\">There have been claims Khamis had been killed before, in March</a>. If confirmed, the death of Khamis would be a severe blow to Gaddafi both in terms of morale and military leadership. Khamis is head of the 32nd brigade, one of the Libyan army's most professional and loyal units, according to Reuters. Gaddafi's government announced earlier this year that his son Saif al-Arab Gaddafi (not to be confused with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/04/gaddafi-son-allegiance-saif-islam\">in the news on Thursday claiming to have made a pact with Islamists</a>) had been killed. Saif al-Arab had a much lower profile than either of his brothers and no major leadership role.</p><p>Rebels have been trying for weeks to take Zlitan, 100 miles (160km) east of Tripoli, which would open the coastal road towards the capital.     <strong>Chris Stephen</strong> writes from Misrata that rebel commanders said last night that the attempt  to capture Zlitan had stalled.</p><p>A second offensive on the eastern front, this one against the key oil town of Brega, has also become bogged down well short of its objective, Chris writes.</p><p>The rebels broke into Zlitan over the weekend, only to find that most of the population did not want to be liberated.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><figure data-media-id='gu-image-377776384'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/14/1308063252866/Chris-Stephen.-001.jpg' alt='Chris Stephen.' width='60' height='60' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Zlitan's leaders are apparently frightened that if the town is liberated, government artillery will be directed at them, and rebel leaders say a conventional attack on the city will cause civilian casualties. Misrata's leaders are now negotiating with Zlitan's elders, trying to encourage a change-of-mind.  \"It's not that much of a problem to capture Zlitan,\" said rebel fighter Mohammed Elfituri. \"The problem is the families won't let us pass.\"</p><p>These failures will leave some wondering whether the rebels, even with concentrated Nato air support, can take ground against their better-equipped foe.</p></blockquote><h2>Syria</h2><p>There were reports that 109 people were killed on Thursday in Hama as the Syrian government continued its crackdown against protesters in the town. One resident said around 250 people have been killed since Sunday. Activist group Avaaz said many bodies had been shot at close range and in the head. Communications, electricity and water remained cut off on Thursday to the city, which is growing short of food and medical supplies.  One resident said he had seen gunmen in plainclothes randomly shooting people in the streets. \"People are being slaughtered like sheep while walking in the street,\" the man told the Associated Press by phone. \"I saw with my own eyes one young boy on a motorcycle who was carrying vegetables being run over by a tank.\" Families are burying their dead in their gardens, parks or on roadsides rather than risking travelling to a cemetery. Most journalists are barred from Syria and it is very hard to independently verify reports.</p><p>Hama is a city of 800,000 people around 130 miles (210km) north of Damascus. It had fallen out of government hands and been free of security forces since June as residents turned on the regime and blockaded the streets against tanks. In 1982 President Bashar al-Assad's father put down a rebellion by members of the Muslim Brotherhood there, killing between 10,000 and 25,000 people.</p><p>My colleagues Ian Black and                                                                              Nour Ali (a pseudonym) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/04/syria-protesters-reject-assad-gesture\">have the full story on Thursday's developments in Hama here</a>, also reporting that Syria's democracy movement and western governments have spurned a decree by Assad permitting the formation of opposition parties.</p><p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/aug/05/us-syria-assad-video\">condemned the Syrian government's attacks on Thursday (see video below)</a>, saying the regime was responsible for the deaths of 2,000 people since the start of the protests. Clinton said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Sometimes you lose sight of the incredible tragedy unfolding on the streets by just looking at the numbers, which are so numbing, but the shooting death of a one-year-old recently by the Syrian regime's tanks and troops is a very stark example of what is going on. We think to date the government is responsible for the deaths of more than 2,000 people of all ages and the United States has worked very hard to corral and focus international opinion to take steps toward a unified response to the atrocities that are occurring.</p></blockquote><p>Jay Carney, a spokesman for the White House, said he felt Bashar al-Assad was \"not indispensable and the US has nothing invested in Assad remaining in power\". Carney said the US viewed him as \"the cause of instability in Syria\" â€“ but stopped short of calling for him to step down.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.40am:</span> A resident of the besieged <strong>Syrian</strong> city of Hama says troops have shelled several neighbourhoods overnight and are preventing food supplies from entering residential areas.</p><p>The man told the Associated Press the attacks started at dawn and that he saw 20 tanks in the central Assi square. He asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals.</p><p>The latest shelling comes as Syrians prepare for mass protests after the first Friday prayers in Ramadan.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.43am:</span> Nato has responded to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2011/aug/04/syria-libya-egypt-middle-east-unrest#block-23\">claims by pro-Gaddafi officials yesterday</a> that two children were killed in an airstrike on Zlitan on Thursday. An official at Nato operational HQ in Naples said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We did hit a military target at around 6.30 [on Thursday] morning and it was a command-and-control site. We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it, but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.05am:</span> My colleague Nour Ali (a pseudonym) sends these YouTube videos of protests in <strong>Syria</strong> on Thursday.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c491huSh0Aw\">A sit-in protest in Medan, Damascus</a>.

He said of Bashar al-Assad, his Syrian counterpart:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He needs to urgently carry out reforms â€¦ or face a sad fate â€¦ The situation is changing and our direction is changing too.</p></blockquote><p>Russia, along with China, is seen as being a block on any more serious action being taken against Syria by the UN security council. Like the UK, the US and France, Russia and China have a veto on the council.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.21am:</span> A Swiss reporter has been telling  al-Jazeera about his visit to Hama, <strong>Syria</strong>, where he saw the bodies of people shot in the head â€“ \"targeted shootings\", he said.  </p><p>Another reporter across the border from the southern Syrian town of Deraa, to Jordan, said people there feel sure the Assad regime is going to fall soon.

The pictures reportedly show rubble-strewn streets and wrecked buildings.</p><p>State TV is claiming Syrian troops were responding to an armed rebellion in the city. This does not tally with what residents and activists have been saying.

It also revisits comments from the US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, who visited Hama last month, comments particularly relevant given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2011/aug/05/syria-libya-egypt-and-middle-east-unrest-live-updates#block-9\">Syrian state TV's apparent claims that troops are in Hama to respond to armed rebellion</a>. Ford said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The Syrian government is saying there are armed groups in Hama. I went there. I didn't see a single gun.

The Tunisian news agency, TAP, quoted witnesses saying Libyan refugees on the Tunisian side of the border had been killed and wounded. </p><p>According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, more than 30,000 Libyans have fled the area in recent weeks.

Here's part of his story as told to a source in Damascus.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>They pulled our tops over our heads so we couldn't see clearly and pinned our arms behind our backs. Then they hit us on the back and head, sometimes with the butts of their guns. They accused me of trying to film protests to send to media. </p><p>They accused us of being foreign agents. We were thrown in the back of an army truck and taken to the base on the outskirts of Damascus â€“ we recognise it as Fourth Division from the uniforms â€“ and they literally threw us out onto the ground. We were  put in a room and beaten from 4pm to 4am. </p><p>Can you imagine? For twelve hours without sleep. It would stop for 15 minutes and then someone else would come in and start. They accused us of working for Saad al-Hariri (former Lebanese prime minister) and the Saudi prince Bandar bin Sultan. There was no point in arguing - they would only beat us more.</p><p>In the morning we were taken to the air force intelligence. We were in a cell of 15 square metres with more than 50 of us in in. There were 15-year-old boys and 80-year-old men. We could only stand up; there was no space to sleep. I thought, why are they locking these people up? This is why protests first started. </p><p>None of them had been at protests. Some were arrested just because they were from Deraa. Many were fathers and sons. People were covered in blood: they had bad bruising and cuts on their bodies or bashed in faces. I tried to lift the spirits of the young people by talking to them. </p><p>One 15-year-old boy asked me why we were there if the president had lifted the emergency law. I didn't know what to say: this country doesn't run on law. A man my age was crying. I asked him why. He told me he had heard his elderly father being beaten and he had begged them to beat him instead. </p><p>'He is old, he can't take it like I can,' he said. 'But they ignored me'.

There are indications that the early members of the revolutionary group throughout Libya were the youth, professionals, academics, etc with various ideological orientations (including nationalists, leftists and Islamists). In Eastern Libya, a \"tribal\" elements is also introduced into the mix; as well as people who have grievances against the regime for having suppressed a revolt there in the early 1990s. However, with the defection of some army officers, bureaucrats, and diplomats, it seems that former members of the regime (e.g. the ex-Justice Minister, Al-Jalil) might be having the upper hand now there and the professionals seem to have been sidelined. We do not know who the west-Libyan members are or even whether they have yet been named to the Council.</p><p>The rebels seem to be well-armed both because of army defections to their side, and because they have probably gained control of the arsenals and military bases in their region. There are speculations as to why the mutinying parts of the Army are not more visible in the fight against the Qaddafi regime. It could be because they hesitate about fighting against other divisions of the military; or it could be that any sort of battle is massively complicated by the arming of civilians and the lack of experience of these opposition civilians in fighting militarily.</p><p>Whether or not the National Front for Salvation of Libya was supported by the CIA is something that we will not know for certain until some sort of archives or memoirs indicate as much, but we do know that Saudi Arabia has previously donated substantial amounts to NFSL. NFSL may be issuing statements in support of the opposition, but it is not clear as to whether they are actually involved on the ground, or not.\"</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><time>3.21pm:</time> The Democratic Libya Information Bureau, has emailed with a potted CV of Jibril, who has been appointed head of the Libyan interim government (See<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/mar/23/libya-crisis-live-updates#block-28\"> 2.37pm</a>).</p><blockquote><p>Educated at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA, he led the team who drafted and formed the unified Arab training manual.

Paul Smyth, a RAF former wing commander and Tornado navigator, discussed some of the military issues.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/mar/23/libya-expert-panel-live-q-and-a?commentpage=2#comment-10073711\">bluesforallah asked about the use of Western group troops</a>. Paul responded:</p><blockquote><p>Ultimately, this is a Libyan problem that demands a Libyan solution. External intervention on the ground should not include western forces but be limited to Arab nations. If a buffer zone (as in Cyprus or Bosnia) becomes necessary I would suggest Egypt should be encouraged to monitor and police it. Nb: airborne monitoring of a ceasefire could involve western air power as it has the necessary capabilities.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/mar/23/libya-expert-panel-live-q-and-a?commentpage=4#comment-10075138\">bill2 wondered if a successful resolution is possible in Libya without resorting to ground troops</a>. Paul replied:</p><blockquote><p>No war in history has been won from the air, or the sea. I agree that air power has yet to win a war. But is this a war? It is a crisis in which the absence of land forces may not prevent a successful outcome (whatever that is defined as). A germane lesson from Iraq (1991), the Balkans in the 1990s and especially Afghanistan in 2001 is that air &amp; sea power can have a decisive effect on a ground conflict. That has already happened at Benghazi but the rebels are going to have to improve their martial capabilities immensely if they are to successfully advance west. That would take some time. The removal of the regime's military capability and the evaporation of popular support for Gaddafi in the west of Libya may allow for another uprising that would make an advance from Benghazi unnecessary...</p></blockquote><!-- Block 33 --><p><time>3.30pm:</time> Anthony Aust, former legal adviser at the Foreign Office who served at the UK mission to the UN and helped draft the resolution on Kuwait in 1990, addressed legal issues in our Q&amp;A.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/mar/23/libya-expert-panel-live-q-and-a?commentpage=4#comment-10075138\">User myopicmuppet asked</a> to what extent military action could be justified by the UN resolution. Anthony replied:</p><blockquote><p>Much will depend on the specific circumstances.

I've just been on the phone to Chris McGreal in Benghazi, who says things are quiet and he doesn't expect much in the way of fighting or bombing as it's Friday prayers. But overnight there was a flurry of diplomatic activity over who should run the no-fly zone and other missions in Libya, as the US wants minimal involvement, preferring to hand things over to Nato.After six days' wrangling, agreement has been reached that Nato will take over the job of enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya. </p><p>Ian Traynor and Nicholas Watt have the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/24/france-turkey-nato-libya\">details of the deal</a>. Here's a flavour.</p><blockquote><p>The US, Britain, France and Turkey agreed to put the three-pronged offensive â€“ a no-fly zone, an arms embargo, and air strikes â€“ under a Nato command umbrella, in a climbdown by France that accommodates strong Turkish complaints about the scope and control of the campaign.</p><p>The deal appeared to end days of infighting among western allies, but needed to be blessed by all 28 Nato member states. At the end of a four-day meeting of Nato ambassadors in Brussels, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general, said Nato had agreed to take command of the no-fly zone from the Americans. Disputes have raged at Nato HQ every day this week. Rasmussen contradicted leading western officials by announcing that Nato's authority was limited to commanding the no-fly zone, but he signalled there was more negotiation to come.</p><p>Under the scheme agreed, the transfer to Nato will take place by the latest in London on Tuesday, when the parties to the coalition against Gaddafi gather in London for a special \"contact group\" conference. French sources said the Benghazi-based Libyan rebel leadership would be in London to attend. The conference will consist of two meetings: a war council made up of the main governments taking part in the military action, as well as a broader assembly including Arab and African countries devoted to Libya's future.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><time>9.16am - Yemen:</time> While things look quiet in Libya today so far, Yemen is bracing itself for big protests. Witnesses say Yemeni forces are trying to prevent anti-government protesters from reaching the capital, Sana'a, for a demonstration to demand that President Ali Abdullah Saleh step down after three decades. Protesters hope the \"day of departure\" rally - modelled on Egypt - will bring a million people out. Witnesses tell AP that troops are manning checkpoints trying to identify protesters to bar them from the capital. Security forces, however, are allowing pro-Saleh demonstrators to enter the capital in buses.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><time>9.26am:</time> More detail is emerging of overnight air strikes near Ajdabiya, where Gaddafi troops have proved surprisingly resilient. France's army chief of staff, Admiral Edouard Guillaud, said a plane destroyed an artillery battery. Guillaud also says French forces destroyed a military base, a munitions depot and maintenance facilities in Libya's interior. </p><p>The British defence secretary, Liam Fox, says British Tornado GR4 aircraft launched a number of guided missiles at Libyan armoured vehicles. </p><p>\"The Tornado aircraft launched a number of guided Brimstone missiles at Libyan armoured vehicles which were threatening the civilian population of Ajdabiya. Brimstone is a high precision, low collateral damage weapon optimised against demanding and mobile targets,\" said Fox.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><time>9.37am - Yemen:</time> As protesters gather in Yemen, the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703784004576220712562139244.html?mod=WSJEurope_hpp_LEFTTopStories\">Wall Street Journal reports</a> that President Saleh and General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, one of Yemen's most powerful military men but now on the side of the demonstrators, are hammering out a deal in which both men would resign within days.</p><blockquote><p>Mr Saleh and Gen Ahmar were intent on preventing bloodshed and preserving stability, the people familiar with the negotiations said. Aides to both men said they understood that Mr. Saleh's continued rule is untenable. But the two men also agreed that his resignation can't happen until the details of a transitional governing council that would take his place.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 5 --><p><time>9.44am - Bahrain:</time> Besides Yemen and Syria, activists plan to hold protests in Bahrain  as well despite a ban on public gatherings. Reuters reports, however, that Wefaq, the mainstream Shia opposition group, has distanced itself from the demonstrations. </p><blockquote><p>\"Wefaq affirms the need to protect safety and lives and not to give the killers the opportunity to shed blood,\" it said on Thursday.</p><p>Nine demonstrations appear to be planned, across different parts of Bahrain, including one headed toward the airport and one that aims to \"liberate\" Salmaniya hospital. Security forces raided Salmaniya hospital in the crackdown, removing several tents set up by protesters in previous weeks. Doctors and human rights groups say strict security has hampered medical access and that four medical staff have been arrested.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 6 --><p><time>10.06am - Yemen:</time> Ahead of today's \"day of departure\" rally in Yemen, Amnesty International has expressed its <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/yemen-warned-over-use-deadly-force-ahead-fresh-protest-2011-03-24\">concern over a new emergency law</a> that grants security forces more powers.</p><blockquote><p>\"After the horrific killing of dozens of protesters last Friday, it is incredibly disturbing that Yemen's leaders have given the security forces more powers through a new emergency law instead of reining them in,\" said Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. \"The emergency law appears to be a desperate attempt to reinforce mechanisms to stamp out dissent and shut out witnesses to human rights abuses.\"</p></blockquote><p>Amnesty has also called for an immediate halt to the use of \"excessive force\" by Syrian security forces after reports that more than 100 were killed in protests in the southern city of Deraa on Wednesday. Katherine Marsh (a pseudonym) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/24/syria-shootings-daraa-government\">reported on public outrage</a> over the government's brutal response in today's Guardian.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><time>10.15am:</time> Unicef, the UN body that deal with children's rights, has expressed its alarm over the impact of the unrest on young people and calls \"for all the parties to take all possible measures to protect civilians.\" It doesn't go as far as Amnesty in putting the onus of governments though.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><time>10.30am:</time> More on the UAE contribution to operations in Libya from AP.</p><p>Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan says the UAE committed six F-16s and six Mirage aircraft to \"participate in the patrols\" over Libya. His comments were published by the state-run Wam news agency on Friday. Qatar, which has sent two planes, is expected to start flying air patrols by this weekend.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><time>10.40am:</time> Some interesting lines from a Reuters round-up of Libya, particularly suggestions that members of Gaddafi's circle are putting out feelers on a ceasefire or safe passage.</p><blockquote><p>Messages seeking some kind of peaceful end to UN-backed military action or a safe exit for members of Gaddafi's entourage have been sent via intermediaries in Austria, Britain and France, said Roger Tamraz, a Middle Eastern businessman with long experience conducting deals with the Libyan regime. </p><p>At the UN, envoys said Sudan had quietly granted permission to use its airspace to nations enforcing the no-fly zone. Sudan's UN ambassador, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, neither confirmed nor denied that report.</p><p>South of the Sahara, local media quoted a cabinet minister as saying Uganda would freeze Libyan assets worth about $375m in line with a UN resolution imposing sanctions on Libya following Gaddafi's violence crackdown. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><time>10.42am:</time> A Danish F-16 fighter lands at Sigonella airbase in Italy </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-373094876'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/25/1301049209515/A-Danish-F16-fighter-land-007.jpg' alt='A Danish F16 fighter lands at Sigonella airbase in Italy' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 11 --><p><time>11.09am - Yemen:</time> President Saleh of Yemen has told thousands of supporters in Sana'a that he was prepared to hand over power but only to what he described as \"safe hands\". This from Reuters. It's unlikely to satisfy the opposition, who want him out immediately.</p><blockquote><p>\"We don't want power, but we need to hand power over to safe hands, not to sick, resentful or corrupt hands ... We are ready to leave power but only for safe hands,\" Saleh said in the speech shown on state TV, as tens of thousands of his opponents protested in another part of the capital. \"We are against firing a single bullet and when we give concessions this is to ensure there is no bloodshed. We will remain steadfast and challenge them with all power we have.\" </p></blockquote><!-- Block 12 --><p><time>11.23am:</time> There is no security presence in the southern Syrian city of Deraa for the first time since Friday when protests began in a move to reduce tension. Checkpoints have been dismantled, but AP reports that journalists have not been allowed in the old city.</p><blockquote><p>\"As you can see, everything is back to normal and it is over,\" an army major, standing in front of the ruling Baath party head office in Daraa, told journalists before they were escorted out of the city.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 13 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-373094877'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif' alt='Live blog: email' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><time>11.37am: </time> A source in Libya has emailed about plans for a \"peace convoy\" from Tripoli to Benghazi. The person says the opposition fear this is a stunt by Gaddafi. If they are peaceful demonstrators and some get killed along the way, the rebels will get the blame, or the convoy is a ploy to send troops towards Benghazi. The Guardian cannot confirm whether such a convoy is planned.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><time>12.17pm:</time> The African Union has called for a transition period in Libya that would lead to democratic elections. The head of the AU told a meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that a consensus was possible. Libyan officials and representatives of the rebels are reported to be in Addis. This from AP.</p><blockquote><p>African Union commission chairman Jean Ping said in an opening speech that the AU favours an inclusive transitional period that would lead to democratic elections. Ping stressed the inevitability of political reforms in Libya, and said that he believes a consensus can be reached. He called the aspirations of the Libyan people \"legitimate.\"</p><p>\"We are convinced that there is enough base to reach a consensus and find a durable solution in Libya,\" he said.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><time>12.44pm: Syria </time> Syrian security men seized dozens of people who staged a brief pro-democracy march in Damascus, Reuters reports, while thousands of protesters in Deraa have been chanting slogans denouncing Maher al-Assad, the president's brother.</p><!-- Block 16 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-373094878'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif' alt='Live blog: email' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><time>12.53pm - Syria: </time> Our contact in Damascus has just emailed about the tense mood in the city before Friday prayers.</p><blockquote><p>Damascus's streets were quiet as this morning, as they usually are before Friday prayers.

I have not yet witnessed any but half an hour ago, groups of pro-Assad supporters - a feature of the past few days - drove round Damascus waving flags and photographs of the president.</p><p>After the pledges to consider reform made by the government early yesterday evening, Syrians across the country were at home last night processing what they meant and whether it changes the game today. \"I do not think it will be enough; anger rose at the killings in Deraa and these announcements - which didn't offer anything solid - may have only added to that,\" said one man late last night.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 17 --><p><time>12.59pm - Bahrain: </time> Anti-government protesters in Karzakan, Bahrain.

There was apparent damage caused by a missile which had landed in the garden. There were fragments of a US air-to-surface missile. A window and some furniture had been broken. According to the father, his 18-year-old daughter was injured and taken to hospital. What was difficult to understand was the link between the rocket fragments and the damage, there were also bullet holes on the wall. The general feeling was that something certainly had happened and it was an effort to underline how civilians have been victims of \"colonial aggression\". Surprisingly, however, we have not been taken to any hospitals. I don't doubt there have been some civilians casualties with thousands of missiles fired, but there has been no evidence of deaths to civilians on a large scale.

Similar to last week, a call for \"freedom\" came from someone inside the mosque which was then entered at by pro-Assad supporters and security forces. Security forces used rough treatment - beating and arresting at least two, witnesses said. Other worshippers quickly left the mosque.

The proof is to compare Libya's case to Yemen.</p><p>The two presidents are not wanted but cling to power. They both used weapons against their people. But the western states were so upset with Libya and decided to bomb Gaddafi's military targets to topple his regime while no one cares about what the Yemeni president is doing although he killed more than 50 of his people by using snipers and hand grenades.</p><p>It is very clear Libya means oil for the west, Yemen does not mean that much.</p></blockquote><p><br /> <br />Al-Sherq al-Awssat, Saudi newspaper based in London</p><blockquote><p>The US administration which did not hesitate in demanding Gaddafi's dismissal, is not ready to force him to leave through a military campaign as it did with Saddam Hussein.</p><p>Gaddafi knows that American and European public opinion are not prepared for western forces to be sent to Libya or any Arab country after the experience in Iraq and Afghanistan and he is capable with his military and money to stand up to air strikes and sanctions.</p><p>The rebels might be able to keep control of Benghazi and the eastern part of the country but they can't enter Tripoli without foreign military support or a military coup.</p></blockquote><p><br /> <br />Al-Itihad, UAE newspaper based in Dubai</p><blockquote><p>Obama hopes that Gaddafi's forces will be defeated quickly, opening the way for a political solution. The hope is that Libya will get a new president or Gaddafi will be forced to leave the country, but what will happen if this is not achieved? What will happen if Gaddafi keeps fighting and uses his money to recruit mercenaries?</p><p>Without sending infantry troops, there will be no quick end to this war.

When the penny drops with them that that's inevitable, then you're likely to see the sort of change, the political momentum, that we've been looking for.\"</p><p>The defence secretary said that rebel forces were constrained. \"They have always had limited capacity on the ground. They're being assisted in terms of communications, in terms of logistics, they may be getting some equipment from elsewhere but they will still have a very limited ground potential.\"</p><p>Fox said the rebels were making slow progress. \"There continues to be progress. If you look at where the opposition forces have made progress â€“ yes, it has been slow, but we've prevented the wholesale slaughter of the population. If other countries believe there is a need for a ground force â€“ I don't think the chances of securing a resolution are even remotely possible.\"</p><p>The defence secretary declined to be drawn on which group may been responsible for the assassination of Gaddafi's former interior minister, General Abdel Fatah Younis, who defected to become the rebels' military leader. \"It's not yet clear who carried out the killing and there are claims and counter-claims it will be at least several days until we know exactly what the situation was. There has always been a mixture of people who make up the opposition forces in Libya â€“ hardly surprising given the history of the country and it would be for the Libyans themselves to sort out exactly how any power structure develops post-Gaddafi.\"</p><p>Sir Menzies Campbell, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the killing raised questions about the stability of the National Transitional Council and showed the need for a \"wholesale\" review of policy towards Libya.</p><p>He told Sky News: \"The assassination has thrown into fairly sharp focus the whole question of the transitional national council. What kind of government if for example, it ever got to Tripoli. I also think that claims of success have always got to be taken with a certain amount of scepticism because it's not about just taking ground temporarily its taking it permanently. I've been saying I think we should take this period for a wholesale examination of policy.</p><p>\"I supported the military action â€“ I continue to support the British government's involvement but I think we have to have a pretty clearer view about what the NTC would be like were they ever to get to Tripoli.\"</p>","headline":"Libya militants 'constrained' says Liam Fox","trailText":"Defence

She spoke in Arabic through a female translator, but was not shown on camera.</p><p>Her story was consistent with the account Obeidi gave at the hotel. She told CNN: \"There is no safe place for me in Tripoli. All my phones are monitored, even this phone I am speaking on right now is monitored. And I am monitored. Yesterday I was kidnapped by a car and they beat me in the street, then brought me here after I was dragged around. Yes, yes, I want to leave Tripoli. In the middle of the night I get nightmares, and I feel threats 24 hours a day. They are constantly threatening me with death.\"</p><p>The woman said after the uproar at the Rixos, Gaddafi's militamen gave her clean clothes and took her to a Libyan TV station to have her broadcast a recantation of her story, but she refused to do so.</p><p>\"The TV station has no credibility and I was fearing the consequences,\" she told CNN. \"Behind the camera, I was facing 15 Kalashnikovs.\"</p><p>On Sunday and Monday, Obeidi had telephone interviews with two TV channels. A government official said she had an agreement not to talk to reporters, but was blocked from getting to the reporters' hotel again on Sunday.</p><p>The last time Obeidi, who is from eastern Libya, which is in rebel hands, was seen was when she was removed from the hotel.</p><p>She said Gaddafi loyalists had abducted her from a taxi at a checkpoint, repeatedly raped her and held her captive for two days. \"Of course they had my hands tied behind me and they had my legs tied and they would hit me when I was tied, and they would bite me, and they would pour alcohol in my eyes so I would not be able to see,\" she told CNN.</p><p>\"One of them, when my hands were still tied and before he raped me, sodomised me with his Kalashnikov rifle. They said: 'Let the men from eastern Libya come and see how we treat their women, and how we rape them, and abuse them.'\" She said she escaped after she being untied by another captive, a 16-year-old girl.</p><p>The woman who spoke to CNN claimed she was detained and beaten when she tried to reach reporters in the hotel a second time on Sunday. She said she had been prevented from leaving the country at the Tunisian border, west of Tripoli, and returned to the capital.</p><p>On Sunday a Qatar-based Libyan dissident network played a phone interview where a woman claiming to be Obeidi said Libyan authorities had declined her request to join her parents in Tobruk, a port city near the Egyptian border, which is also under rebel control.</p><p>A government spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, said Obeidi had made a deal with the attorney general not to speak to reporters so as not to compromise <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/29/iman-al-obedi-libya-rape-claim-charges\" title=\"\">her case</a>, and he was aware she was trying to reach media on Sunday. \"She broke her agreement with the attorney general by trying to speak to the media and was taken away,\" Ibrahim said.</p><p>He added that he did not know what happened to Obeidi after she was removed from the hotel.</p><p>Afaf Youssef, a woman the government says is Obeidi's lawyer, told claims her client is refusing to speak to reporters because her case is under investigation.</p><p>Youssef said she was one of two lawyers taking up the criminal case against the men.

Libyan state TV reported that Saif has arrived in captivity and unhurt at an army base in the town of Zintan, 90 miles south-west of Tripoli.</p><p>Muammar Gaddafi's second and highest-profile son, who vowed to die fighting but was taken without firing a shot, was captured along with several bodyguards by fighters near the town of Obari in Libya's southern desert, said the interim justice minister and other officials.</p><p>Saif was said to be in good health, according to the justice minister Mohammed al-Alagi, although photographs showed bandages .</p><p>\"We have arrested Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in [the] Obari area,\" the minister told Reuters.</p><p>Saif was captured near the southern city of Sabha with two aides trying to smuggle him out to neighbouring Niger, militia commander Bashir al-Tayeleb said.</p><p>Zintan, a base for forces in the Nafusa Mountains which played a key part in the storming of Tripoli in the summer, is reported to have crowds dancing in the streets and waving the Libyan flag.</p><p>There are reports that an angry mob tried to storm the plane on which Saif was taken to the western mountain town of Zintan, the home of one of the largest revolutionary brigades in Libya. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/OE0dMxmTKHA\" title=\"\">Video footage</a> showed dozens of people on top of the aircraft.</p><p>Gunfire is echoing across the capital, Tripoli, where large crowds have gathered in Martyrs' Square firing volleys of automatic fire in the air. \"A great day, a great day,\" said Abdullah, a taxi driver, stuck in one of the traffic jams that built up around the square.</p><p></p><p>Libyan TV also showed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=191801160901738&amp;set=a.129023130512875.32557.119477011467487&amp;type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">a photo purportedly of Saif in custody</a>. He is sitting by a bed and holding up three bandaged fingers as a guard looks on.</p><p>There were reports that Saif was wounded during his capture.  But Saif told Reuters that his hand was bandaged due to wounds sustained in a Nato air strike a month ago. Asked if he was feeling all right, he replied: \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"At the beginning he was very scared. He thought we would kill him,\" Ahmed Ammar, one of his captors, told the news agency.</p><p>Tlayeb, of the Zintan brigades said it would be up to the Libya's transitional ruling National Transitional Council to decide on where Saif would be tried.</p><p>He added that there was still no information about Libya's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi's location.</p><p>Many Libyans believe Saif holds the keys in his head to billions of dollars of public money amassed by the Gaddafi family. But his captors said they found only a few thousand dollars and a cache of rifles in vehicles seized during his capture.</p><p>The arrest comes after months of hunting for the suspect in the southern desert but also provides the first challenge for the new government which prime minister Abdel-Rahim al-Keeb is due to announce on Sunday.</p><p>Previously, the ruling National Transitional Council has insisted it will try any war criminals in Libya and not extradite them to the international criminal court which in June indicted Gaddafi for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>\"If they want to try Saif then what can they do to make Zintan hand him over?\" said Henry Smith, an analyst with the Control Risks group.</p><p>\"They may leave his fate to Zintanis but then where does that leave Libya's embryonic judicial system? This is an acid test of the NTC's authority.\"</p><p>Last month, Saif told the international criminal court he is innocent of alleged crimes against humanity. The court, based in The Hague, is seeking his arrest on charges relating to Libya's civil war.</p><p>Alagi said he was in touch with the ICC over how to deal with Saif, either at home or The Hague. He told al-Jazeera: \"We Libyans do not oppose the presence of international monitors to monitor the trial procedures that will take place for the symbols of the former regime.\"</p><p>The international criminal court's chief prosecutor will go to Libya in a week to discuss how and where Saif will be prosecuted.</p><p>Luis Moreno-Ocampo said: \"I'm going to Libya to discuss how we manage this issue. But the news is Saif will get justice. Where and how, that we will discuss.\"</p><p>The ICC charged Muammar Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, and Senussi with crimes against humanity for the bombing and shooting of civilian protesters in February.</p><p>British foreign secretary, William Hague, welcomed Saif's arrest as \"another significant step forward in the transition to a new, democratic Libya.\"</p><p>Hague added: \" We stand ready to assist the Libyan government and the ICC to bring Saif al-Islam to justice. I welcome the Libyan authorities' commitment to ensure his detention and trial meet international standards.\"</p><p>Saif fled Libya after forces loyal to Libya's new rulers captured and apparently killed his father outside his hometown of Sirte. But Libyan officials are determined to resist attempts to bring Saif before the ICC, claiming he should instead face justice at home.</p><p>When Tripoli seemed set to fall to the rebels, he appeared outside a hotel in the city meeting loyalists and talking to western reporters. He went underground after the capital fell to revolutionary forces.</p><p>Born in 1972, Saif is the oldest of seven children of Muammar and Safia Gaddafi. He drew western backing in previous years by touting himself as a liberal reformer but then staunchly backed his father in the brutal crackdown on rebels in the regime's final days.</p>","headline":"Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured in Libya","trailText":"Interim Tripoli government says son of Muammar Gaddafi was arrested while attempting to flee to neighbouring Niger","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/19/1321711525463/Saif-al-Islam-gaddafi-cap-003.jpg","wordcount":"889","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"382058047","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5482317","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Chris Stephen in Tripoli and David Batty","internalPageCode":"1664886","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-11-22T11:43:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/19/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-captured","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/19/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-captured","tags":[{"id":"world/saif-al-islam-gaddafi","webTitle":"Saif al-Islam Gaddafi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/saif-al-islam-gaddafi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/saif-al-islam-gaddafi","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/libya","webTitle":"Libya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/libya","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"law/international-criminal-court","webTitle":"International criminal court","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/international-criminal-court","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/international-criminal-court","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidbatty","webTitle":"David Batty","rcsId":"GNL004817","r2ContributorId":"15538","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/david_batty_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Batty is a news editor and reporter.

The stockpile has since been secured in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</p><p>The Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli has asked the Libyan authorities to ensure the concentrated uranium is used for the benefit of Libyans, in \"industrial and agricultural development and in the production of clean energy\".</p><p>Gaddafi signed the chemical weapons convention and joined the OPCW in 2004 as part of an ultimately abortive efforts to shake off pariah status and mend relations with the west.</p><p>Libya had 13 tonnes of mustard gas when it signed the treaty but Gaddafi claimed to have destroyed the munitions needed to deliver it. Gaddafi's regime destroyed about 54% of its mustard gas stocks and about 40% of the chemicals used to manufacture the substance, besides 3,500 bombs intended to deliver deadly chemicals.</p><p>The process, supervised by OPCW experts, resumed in 2012. It intensified in September 2013 with the signing of a deal with Washington, which was increasingly concerned that the stockpiles might fall into the hands of ex-rebel militias that the post-Gaddafi government has struggled to contain.</p><p>The Syrian disarmament operation, agreed to by Damascus in 2013 under threat of western military action, is running behind schedule, sparking mounting concern in Washington. Syria has declared around 700 tonnes of the most dangerous chemicals and they were supposed to have been shipped out by 31 December. Another 500 tonnes of less dangerous precursor chemicals are supposed to be shipped out by Wednesday.</p><p>But so far just two small shipments have left the Syrian port of Latakia, accounting for less than 4% of the country's declared arsenal of most dangerous chemicals and none of the precursors. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has warned President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that he could face consequences if he fails to meet his obligations on giving up the weapons.<br></p>","headline":"Libya says chemical weapons destroyed","trailText":"Government says country has been rid of weapons from Gaddafi era in process hailed by monitors as example for Syria <br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"607","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428938889","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f1c992e4b025fe0e2e665b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Agence France-Presse in Tripoli","internalPageCode":"2038364","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T05:36:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","tags":[{"id":"world/libya","webTitle":"Libya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/libya","references":[]},{"id":"world/chemical-weapons","webTitle":"Chemical weapons","description":"The latest news and comment on chemical weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/chemical-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e28d892f-d2a5-4b6f-ac5b-f39498c93df0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","source":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","photographer":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","altText":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.","height":"132","credit":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","caption":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.

British crews piloted US Reaper and Predator drones in Afghanistan on 2,150 occasions between 2006 and 2012 â€“ an average of almost once a day.</p><p>That does not include the thousands of missions British forces have flown with their own fleet of 10 Reaper aircraft.</p><p>The MoD has also for the first time provided a breakdown of the number of missiles fired by UK drones every month between May 2008 and April 2013.</p><p>These attacks peaked in November 2011, when 25 missiles were fired. There has been only one month in which no missiles were launched â€“ December 2008.</p><p>Latest figures show RAF drones fired 94 Hellfire missiles in Afghanistan during 2013, bringing the total number of munitions and bombs fired by British unmanned systems since 2008 to 457.</p><p>The figures were released last week, nine months after a freedom of information (FoI) request, to <a href=\"http://dronewars.net/\" title=\"\">Drone Wars UK</a>, a website that researches and monitors the British use of unmanned technologies.</p><p>The website's creator, Chris Cole, said: \"This latest revelation once again demonstrates the secrecy surrounding the use of armed drones and once again underlines the need for increased scrutiny and greater transparency about their use.</p><p>\"The nature of drone technology means  they are being used with little or no public accountability.</p><p>\"Unless we act now to curb this new weaponry it seems inevitable that drones will increasingly be used to launch secret and unaccountable military attacks leading to global instability and increased insecurity.\"</p><p>Heather Barr, of Human Rights Watch, added: \"One of the problems with drone programmes from the beginning has been a near-total lack of transparency about the scale of the programmes, where they were operating, what their goals are, and who they are targeting and how. If it is now not even possible to know which country has its finger on the button, that adds yet another layer of confusion which will make accountability even more elusive.\"</p><p>The MoD statement to Drone Wars UK makes clear British pilots were flying US drones in Afghanistan long before the RAF had any unmanned aircraft of its  own; the UK did not start flying its own Reapers in Afghanistan until mid-2008.</p><p>The FoI reply states: \"Between October 2006 and 31 December 2012, UK aircrew had flown approximately 2,150 operational missions using US Reaper and Predator remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in support of operations in Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>\"UK and US personnel also operate both nations' RPAS as part of the launch and recovery phase in Afghanistan. Of the 2,150 missions flown by UK personnel, there were 271 missions in Afghanistan when UK personnel utilised a US Reaper as a UK Reaper was unavailable. During these missions, UK personnel released 39 weapons.\"</p><p>While the MoD gave some details about operations in which the UK has borrowed US equipment, it refused to give details about operations flown by British crews formally within the US air force. \"I am withholding information about weapons released by UK personnel embedded with the US air force on operations in Afghanistan and Libya,\" the letter says.</p><p>\"I have carried out a public interest test. Releasing the information would provide a limited additional understanding of the UK's relationship with the US over that which is already in the public domain in relation to operations in Afghanistan.</p><p>\"Releasing the information concerned, when the other government has not given permission to do so, would undermine the relationship of trust that exists between the UK and other countries. Consequently, I am withholding the information. Information is not held for operations in Iraq.\"</p><p>Cole said it was essential that information about drone operations undertaken by British RAF pilots while embedded with US forces be made available for public scrutiny and debate.\"</p><p>He called on the defence select committee, which is holding an inquiry into drones, to reconsider its decision to hold its sessions in private.</p><p>The MoD insists drones operate under the same rules as other aircraft: \"The RAF and USAF continue to work closely to provide persistent armed intelligence and surveillance to allied armed forces in Afghanistan. This occasionally involves the RAF utilising USAF assets when UK aircraft are unavailable. These aircraft always operate on UK tasks, with RAF aircrew in control, using UK rules of engagement.\"</p><p>The MoD has yet to decide what it will do with its fleet of armed Reapers once UK forces have left Helmand province at the end of combat operations this December.</p><p>Under current rules, the aircraft cannot be flown in the UK. The MoD is considering options that might include basing the drones in Kenya to support military operations against terrorists in the Horn of Africa.</p>","headline":"RAF has fired missiles in

Photograph: The report</figcaption></figure><p>The three lawyers interviewed the source, a military policeman who worked secretly with a Syrian opposition group and later defected and fled the country. In three sessions in the last 10 days they found him credible and truthful and his account \"most compelling\".</p><p>They put all evidence under rigorous scrutiny, says<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/jan/20/torture-of-persons-under-current-syrian-regime-report\" title=\"\"> their report, which has been obtained by the Guardian and CNN</a>.</p><p>The authors are Sir Desmond de Silva QC, former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the former lead prosecutor of former Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic, and Professor David Crane, who indicted President Charles Taylor of Liberia at the Sierra Leone court.</p><p>The defector, who for security reasons is identified only as Caesar, was a photographer with the Syrian military police. He smuggled the images out of the country on memory sticks to a contact in the Syrian National Movement, which is supported by the Gulf state of Qatar. Qatar, which has financed and armed rebel groups, has called for the overthrow of Assad and demanded his prosecution.</p><p>The 31-page report, which was commissioned by a leading firm of London solicitors acting for Qatar, is being made available to the UN, governments and human rights groups. Its publication appears deliberately timed to coincide with this week's UN-organised Geneva II peace conference, which is designed to negotiate a way out of the Syrian crisis by creating a transitional government.</p><p>Caesar told the investigators his job was \"taking pictures of killed detainees\". He did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture. But he did describe a highly bureaucratic system.</p><p>\"The procedure was that when detainees were killed at their places of detention their bodies would be taken to a military hospital to which he would be sent with a doctor and a member of the judiciary, Caesar's function being to photograph the corpses&nbsp;â€¦ There could be as many as 50 bodies a day to photograph which require 15 to 30 minutes of work per corpse,\" the report says.</p><p>\"The reason for photographing executed persons was twofold. First to permit a death certificate to be produced without families requiring to see the body, thereby avoiding the authorities having to give a truthful account of their deaths; second to confirm that orders to execute individuals had been carried out.\"</p><p>Families were told that the cause of death was either a \"heart attack\" or \"breathing problems\", it added. \"The procedure for documentation was that when a detainee was killed each body was given a reference number which related to that branch of the security service responsible for his detention and death.</p><p>\"When the corpse was taken to the military hospital it was given a further number so as to document, falsely, that death had occurred in the hospital. Once the bodies were photographed, they were taken for burial in a rural area.\"</p><p>Three experienced forensic science experts examined and authenticated samples of 55,000 digital images, comprising about 11,000 victims. \"Overall there was evidence that a significant number of the deceased were emaciated and a significant minority had been bound and/or beaten with rod-like objects,\" the report says.</p><p>\"In only a minority of the cases&nbsp;â€¦ could a convincing injury that would account for death be seen, but any fatal injury to the back of the body would not be represented in the images&nbsp;â€¦</p><p>\"The forensics team make clear that there are many ways in which an individual may be killed with minimal or even absent external evidence of the mechanism.\"</p><p>The inquiry team said it was satisfied there was \"clear evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government. It would support findings of crimes against humanity and could also support findings of war crimes against the current Syrian regime.\"</p><p>De Silva told the Guardian that the evidence \"documented industrial-scale killing\".  He added: \"This is a smoking gun of a kind we didn't have before. It makes a very strong case indeed.\"</p><p>Calls for Assad or others to face justice at the international criminal court in The Hague have foundered on the problems that Syria is not a member of the court, and that the required referral by the UN security council might not be supported by the US and UK or would be blocked by Russia, Syria's close ally.</p><p>Nice said: \"It would not necessarily be possible to track back with any degree of certainty to the head of state. Ultimately, in any war crimes trial you can imagine a prosecutor arguing that the overall quantity of evidence meant that the pattern of behaviour would have been approved at a high level.</p><p>\"But whether you can go beyond that and say it must be head of state-approved is rather more difficult. But 'widespread and systematic' does betoken government control.\"</p><p>Crane said: \"Now we have direct evidence of what was happening to people who had disappeared. This is the first provable, direct evidence of what has happened to at least 11,000 human beings who have been tortured and executed and apparently disposed of.</p><p>\"This is amazing. This is the type of evidence a prosecutor looks for and hopes for.  We have pictures, with numbers that marry up with papers with identical numbers â€“ official governmentdocuments. We have the person who took those pictures. That's beyond-reasonable-doubt-type evidence.\"</p><p>A US administration official told the Guardian on Monday: \"We stand with the rest of the world in horror at these images which have come to light. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of the regime and call on it to adhere to international obligations with respect to the treatment of prisoners.</p><p>\"We have long spoken out about mistreatment and deteriorating prison conditions in Syria. These latest reports, and the photographs that support them, demonstrate just how far the regime is willing to go to not only deny freedom and dignity to the Syrian people, but to inflict significant emotional and physical pain in the process. To be sure, these reports suggest widespread and apparently systematic violations of international humanitarian law.</p><p>\"The regime has the ability to improve the atmosphere for negotiations in Geneva by making progress in several areas. However, this latest report of horrific and inhumane prison conditions/actions further underscores that if anything, it is tarnishing the environment for the talks.</p><p>\"As we have for over two years, and again today, we call on the Syrian government to grant immediate and unfettered access to all their detention facilities by international documentation bodies, including the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria.</p><p>\"We have long said that those responsible for atrocities in Syria must be held accountable for their gross violations of human rights. The United States continues to support efforts to promote accountability and transitional justice, and we call on the international community to do the same.\"</p><p>William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, said: \"This report offers further evidence of the systematic violence and brutality being visited upon the people of Syria by the Assad regime. We will continue to press for action on all human rights violations in Syria, and for accountability for those who perpetrate them.\"</p><p>Nadim Houry of Human Rights Watch said his organisation had not had the opportunity to authenticate the images.
