It has got tougher in the last six to 12 months.\" </p><p>Ferguson's comments came after BHP announced it was indefinitely delaying the planned $20bn (£13bn) Olympic Dam copper expansion in South Australia and plans to build a new harbour, estimated at more than $20bn, to nearly double its iron ore exports in Western Australia, looking for cheaper alternatives. </p><p>But Ferguson's Labor party colleague Senator Penny Wong, the finance minister, disagreed with his assessment. \"We still have a lot of investment coming in to this country, about half a trillion dollars in the pipeline and more than half of that at the advanced stage,\" she told ABC News Breakfast.</p><p>\"I think the mining boom still has a long way to run. But what I would say is that the government has always assumed that the terms of trade would step down over time, that's what our budget is predicated on.</p><p>\"I think Mr Ferguson was referring to when the terms of trade peaked, and that's factored into the Government's budget.\"</p><p>Ferguson later released a statement rowing back from what he had initially said. \"The commodity price boom is over but in terms of investment in Australia the boom continues,\" he said.</p><p>Fuelled by Chinese-led demand for coal, iron ore and other resources, Australia's economy was one of the very few in the developed world to sail through the global financial crisis without sliding into recession. </p><p>The resources boom fuelled what has been dubbed a two-speed economy, which has pumped up the Australian dollar and exacerbated the pain felt in manufacturing sectors and retail in Australia's most populous states. </p><p>While manufacturers like Ford and Bluescope Steel have shut down plants and axed jobs, Australia's unemployment level has stayed around 5% thanks to substantial jobs growth in resources projects, where truck drivers command six-figure pay packets. </p><p>Politicians may be worried the whole economy is moving into the slow lane but analysts say the fear is premature, as energy projects, underpinned by customers who have already been locked in, will continue full steam ahead. </p><p>\"A marriage of our macroeconomic research with analysis of already committed and possible projects has confirmed our expectations that a peak is coming, but is yet to arrive,\" National Australia Bank economists said in a report. </p><p>NAB expects the resources boom to peak in 2013 and 2014, when resource capital spending will be around 1% of gross domestic product higher than now. </p><p>BHP put the Olympic Dam expansion on hold as it reported a 35% slide in second-half profit, the biggest sign of the pain inflicted by the slowdown in China's economic growth.</p><p>Weaker demand from China has knocked prices of all key commodities, including iron ore, languishing at its lowest levels since December 2009, copper, coal and aluminium, clouding the outlook for all miners. </p><p>In response to pressure from shareholders worried about poor returns in a weak global markets, miners have put the brakes on capital spending, with BHP on Wednesday announcing it would not sanction any major new projects in the year to June 2013. </p><p>The Olympic Dam project, which had been due for approval by December 2012, would have created 25,000 jobs, according to the South Australian government. </p><p>\"The next round was always going to be difficult and I must say Olympic Dam was always a very, very challenging project – its sheer size,\" Ferguson said. </p><p>He said he still hoped the project could go ahead. \"Our requirement now is to continue to work together in partnership, South Australian and Australian governments, with BHP Billiton to actually get this project in place,\" he said.</p>","headline":"Australian minister declares end of mining resources boom","trailText":"<p>Labor's Martin Ferguson says mining boom has peaked after BHP Billiton delayed

National saving has been strong, and household saving has been high in recent years. But public sector saving has been too low. Governments have made spending and tax decisions that have produced almost no net savings from a decade of elevated resources prices.&rdquo;</p> <p>While governments are criticised for not saving enough money from the mining boom, the report emphasises it is not a &ldquo;national crisis of under-saving&rdquo;.</p> <p>Australia&rsquo;s relatively low inflation rates throughout the boom and its stable economy are saving graces, says the report, which will play a role in Australia&rsquo;s avoiding a recession if government policies fall into line.</p> <p>The effect of the mining boom on other industries is also studied, and declines in tourism and manufacturing are attributed, in part, to the high Australian dollar which has been mainly driven by the boom.</p> <p>However, the report says manufacturing has been in steady decline since the 1970s and, while the mining boom accelerated the decline, it did not cause it.</p> <p>The institute advises against government subsidies or bailouts for the manufacturing industry, saying an average of $63,000 has been spent on each manufacturing employee over the past decade.</p> <p>&ldquo;The cost of government support via subsidies or trade barriers is high,&rdquo; the report says.</p> <p>&ldquo;Funds have opportunity costs: they could be used to retrain workers rather than to prolong careers in unviable sectors.&rdquo;</p> <p>The report recommends public saving be increased straight away and a &ldquo;careful&rdquo; review of the case for a more comprehensive mining tax be undertaken, as well as budget rules changed so there is no &ldquo;implied licence&rdquo; to spend resources boom windfalls. &ldquo;It can also be fairer to future generations to save part of large terms of trade windfalls, especially if they derive from exhaustible resources,&rdquo; the report says.</p>","headline":"Governments have squandered mining boom windfall, says report","trailText":"<p>Grattan Institute says successive governments wasted spoils of boom and more comprehensive mining tax should be considered</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/29/1375063733850/8997db38-3d1e-4234-845d-0d5e93a451e0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"447","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"413835509","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"51f5ca05e4b041a68c3f19bf","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Bridie Jabour","internalPageCode":"1943092","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-01T02:51:22+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/governments-squandered-mining-boom-windfall","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jul/29/governments-squandered-mining-boom-windfall","tags":[{"id":"world/australia-economy","webTitle":"Australia economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-economy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia-economy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"business/mining","webTitle":"Mining","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/mining","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/bridie-jabour","webTitle":"Bridie Jabour","r2ContributorId":"56485","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/10/1405016852753/Bridie-Jabour.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/7/10/1405016871935/Bridie-Jabour-R.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Bridie Jabour is a reporter for Guardian Australia.

Xstrata also warned that the resource super profits tax (RSPT) put nearly 15,000 potential jobs at risk, as it was rethinking a total of A$22bn worth of investment in Australia.</p><p>\"The RSPT has created significant uncertainty for the future of mining investment into Australia and would impair the value of previously approved projects and exploration to the point that continued investment can no longer be justified,\" said Xstrata's chief executive, Mick Davis.</p><p>The government has been feeling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2010/may/04/rio-tinto\" title=\"the anger of the mining industry\">the anger of the industry</a> since it said it would impose a 40% tax on profits generated from resources projects in the country. Miners claim the tax is unfair because it takes a slice of the profits from successful mines without considering the risk taken by mining groups and their shareholders.</p><p>But prime minister Kevin Rudd has insisted that he is committed to reforming the tax landscape so that the government receives a larger slice of profits made from the country's natural resources.</p><p>Rudd, who faces a general election this year, had rejected the miners' claims that they would be driven out of Australia as \"balderdash\" and \"bunkum\".</p><p>Speaking about Xstrata's threat to cancel projects, Rudd said that it was part of the battle with the industry over tax reform.</p><p>\"There is going to be claim and counter claim,\" he added. \"There will be a lot of heat and there will be a lot of acrimony in this public debate. The government is determined to prosecute tax reform.\"</p><p>Analysts at stockbroking firm Ambrian believe Rudd's tough talking may have encouraged Davis to abandon the development at the Wandoan thermal coal project and the Ernest Henry copper mine.</p><p>\"The war of words between the miners and the Australian government continue, with the miners redirecting investment spend into a mounting media attack on the Rudd's government's plans in an effort to draw the government to the negotiating table,\" said Ambrian's Peter Davey and Nick Mellor in a research note.</p><p>\"While a full backdown by the government is too much to hope for, one can sense a compromise can be struck. The question is, how many more projects are going to be shelved before this happens and could it be settled before the general election?\" they added.</p><p>Other companies have also abandoned new projects in Australia since the supertax was announced, including gold producer AngloGold and iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group. Fortescue said that RSPT threatened around £10bn of new projects, although unlike Xstrata's cuts this proposed spending was only at an early stage.</p>","headline":"Xstrata halts mining work in protest at Australian supertax","trailText":"Xstrata abandons work at two mines in Queensland it claims will no longer be economically viable if the firm is hit by the 40% tax on profits","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/6/23/1245744361042/Xstrata-mine-004.jpg","wordcount":"492","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"363323954","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3435459","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Graeme Wearden","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-06-04T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1407822","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-06-06T12:08:31Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/03/xtrata-supertax-protest-australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jun/03/xtrata-supertax-protest-australia","tags":[{"id":"business/xstrata","webTitle":"Xstrata","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/xstrata","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/xstrata","references":[]},{"id":"business/mining","webTitle":"Mining","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/mining","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/graemewearden","webTitle":"Graeme Wearden","r2ContributorId":"19202","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476600504/Graeme-Wearden.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476625361/Graeme-Wearden-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Graeme Wearden tracks the latest world business, economic and financial news in our daily liveblog.

The bungalows here wouldn't be out of place in a rural version of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/neighbours\" title=\"\">Neighbours</a>, their large grassy verges perfect for kids to play cricket on.</p><p>But the bus has not come to pick up the children. It's here to take contract workers to their shifts in the town's mining and construction industries.</p><p>Denise Robertson has lived here with her husband and three children for a decade. \"We came to <a href=\"http://www.moranbah.com.au/web/\" title=\"\">Moranbah</a> because it was full of families and children. Every year, we used to have our Christmas BBQs on the street,\" she said. \"Now it's full of contractors and we don't know who is coming and going.\"</p><p>Seven three-bedroom apartments have been built for fly-in fly-out (Fifo) or drive-in drive-out (Dido) mining industry workers on a single block at the end of the cul-de-sac. Five more apartments have been approved behind Robertson's house and there is an application in for another three to be built directly opposite.</p><p>\"Cars come in and go out so often that I don't know how many people live in the street any more,\" said Robertson.</p><p>Moranbah, like many towns in Queensland's Bowen basin, is in the grip of the country's once-in-a-generation mining boom. The area, 600 miles north of Brisbane and two hours' drive inland from the Great Barrier Reef, is home to Australia's richest coal reserves and is experiencing the highs and lows of a rapidly expanding industry. The mining boom is helping the Australian economy buck global economic woes. But there are downsides too, as the burgeoning industries skew local economies and make it that much harder for other businesses to thrive.</p><p>\"There's nothing anywhere else like what we're seeing in Moranbah,\" said the demographer <a href=\"http://www.bernardsalt.com.au/\" title=\"\">Bernard Salt</a>, who recently completed a study into the area for the local regional council. The town has a permanent residential population of 8,500. Its non-resident Fifo/Didoworkers are estimated to number another 6,500. Accommodation to house 3,500 more single workers has just been approved, to be built on the southern side of the town.</p><p>\"It's towns like this which are at a tipping point,\" said Salt. \"The fear is that as the non-resident population which works in the mining industry rises, the services in the local area will become so stretched that the town will cave in on itself,\" he said.</p><p>In the town square, shops have closed as rents rocket. Some people prefer to drive the four-hour round trip to the coast to do their weekly grocery shop because the local supermarket often runs low on essentials.</p><p>Across the regional council area, the picture is much the same. The number of non-residents is predicted to grow by 40% over the next year, as more mines come on line. Workers are mostly attracted by the high salaries, currently estimated to be more than double the national average. But non-mining businesses in the town can struggle to get staff. Roger Ferguson, who runs a motel in Moranbah, said he has had to hire three workers from Thailand because he can't get local staff to fill vacancies. \"People don't want to work for A$25 [£16] an hour when they can earn A$60-70 an hour working in the mines,\" he said.</p><p>Moranbah's mayor, Anne Baker, said her town is pro-mining and a large proportion of its permanent residents work in the industry. But, she said: \"It's hard to sustain livability in your community if you're going to be inundated with non-residents.\"</p><p>She cites housing as the single biggest barrier to bringing families to the town. A four-bedroom house in town often costs A$10,000 a month to rent. To buy one would cost close to A$1m.</p><p>\"We need more affordable family accommodation,\" said Baker, who is calling on greater investment into the region's infrastructure.</p><p>The federal government's controversial mining tax on iron ore and coal, starting on 1 July (a 30% tax on company's annual profits over A$75m), is intended to spread the benefits of the mining boom to all Australians. The government estimates it will raise A$13.4bn over the first four years, some of which will be returned to low and middle income earners in the form of tax breaks and pension concessions. Small businesses will also get tax breaks and a regional infrastructure fund will put money into critical infrastructure in country areas.</p><p>For Salt, it will take more than an injection of cash from the government's mining tax to save towns like Moranbah.</p><p>\"There needs to be a nationbuilding commitment to places like Moranbah, including improved infrastructure and services for the people who live there,\" he said. \"If we don't address this, we will end up with just a series of hotel towns with hotel services where the population will be transient and come in and out just for work.\"</p>","headline":"Australia's mining boom puts pressure on local communities","trailText":"<p>As towns near mines become dominated by contract workers, rents rise and the economic and social landscape changes</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"33","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/6/28/1340879650542/Australia-mining-003.jpg","wordcount":"795","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"392301050","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6351641","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alison Rourke","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1766188","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-02T16:47:40Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/29/australia-mining-boom-pressure-local-communities","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/29/australia-mining-boom-pressure-local-communities","tags":[{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/mining","webTitle":"Mining","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/mining","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alison-rourke","webTitle":"Alison Rourke","r2ContributorId":"39677","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/25/1372160236561/Alison-Rourke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Rourke has written for The Guardian and The Observer newspapers since 2010.

Will she use this to push her views on tax and mining?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-04T01:01:32Z","body":"<p>Outside her native Australia, Gina Rinehart's name is likely to be met with quizzical looks – but all that could be about to change, because the 57-year-old from Western Australia is on track to become the world's richest woman.</p><p>Rinehart is a mining magnate who has built her fortune in the iron-ore-rich hills of the country's Pilbara region – an area the size of Spain, around 700 miles north of Perth. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlshmavonian/2012/02/01/gina-rinehart-doubles-up/\" title=\"\">Forbes has just estimated her personal worth at $US18bn (£11.3bn)</a> – putting her ahead of Google's founders, and fast advancing on the $26bn family fortune controlled by Christy Walton, of the US Wal-Mart dynasty.</p><p>Rinehart is known as a workaholic and for her strong political views, but has always been publicity-shy. However, a new, high-profile business deal, and a public row with her family, mean the multibillionaire's days of privacy are numbered.</p><p>Last week her company, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/01/fairfax-media-takeover-australia-rinehart\" title=\"\">Hancock Prospecting, launched a raid on one of Australia's oldest newspaper groups, Fairfax Media</a>, which owns the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne, together with the Australian Financial Review and a string of radio stations. The swoop made Rinehart the largest single shareholder with a stake of just under 13%.</p><p>\"I think her move into Fairfax is a power play,\" says Adele Ferguson, a senior financial journalist for Fairfax whose unauthorised biography of Rinehart is due for publication this year. \"She's probably hoping to get some editorial influence, even if it's a perception thing. Journalists might think twice about what they are writing about her if she is the company's biggest shareholder.\"</p><p>Rinehart's assault on Fairfax followed her acquisition of a 10% stake (and a seat on the board) in the commercial television network, Ten.</p><p>\"She wants to influence debate,\" says the Perth-based business writer Tim Treadgold, who follows the mining industry. \"She wants to force Australian governments to pay greater heed to the resources sector because she genuinely believes that the future of this country is as a supplier of raw materials to China, not as a manufacturer in competition with China,\" said Treadgold.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/may/31/mining-media-australia-carbon-tax\" title=\"\">Some of Rinehart's views may be controversial</a>, but she is a woman Australians are increasingly taking notice of.</p><p>She is a climate change sceptic (last year she helped fund <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jun/27/lord-monckton-university-lecture1\" title=\"\">the controversial visit to Australia of the climate change denier</a> Lord Monckton) and has previously promoted the idea that Western Australia secede from the rest of the country. She once looked into the feasibility of using a nuclear bomb to create a harbour on the north-west coat of Australia.</p><p>Rinehart is against the government's proposed new tax on mining profits and in favour of bringing in cheap \"guest labour\" from Asia for the mining sector.</p><p>Treadgold calculates that Rinehart's Pilbara mine, Hope Downs (which she owns in equal partnership with Rio Tinto), is likely to deliver her a profit of close to $A3bn (£2bn) a year when it reaches full production of 45m tonnes a year.</p><p>When combined with Rinehart's other mines due to come on line in the next few years, Treadgold believes she could be on her way to being the richest person in the world. A Citigroup Global Markets paper last year on the next generation of mines around the world estimated that three of the top ten were owned by Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. \"What hit me was that she was named [in the report] alongside the usual corporate suspects like BHP, Anglo American and Xstrata but what you have to realise is that she owns these mines personally,\" he said.</p><p>The scale and speed at which Rinehart has accumulated her wealth is nothing short of breath-taking. Born Georgina Hancock, in 1954, she is the daughter of the legendary Western Australian mining figure Lang Hancock – the so-called \"King of the Pilbara\". Lang is credited with discovering vast tracts of iron ore deposits in the region in 1952 where his family had been pastoralists for generations.</p><p>He was regarded in equal measure as a visionary and ruthless opportunist. He did business with the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and reportedly suggested \"no-good half-caste\" Aborigines be sterilised so they would \"breed themselves out in the future\".</p><p>Lang died in 1992, leaving the family business to his only child, Gina, then a 38-year-old widow with four children. It was in serious trouble, bar a 2.5% royalty stream from iron ore sales on mining leases belonging to Rio Tinto in the Pilbara (a deal done by her father in the 1960s). In today's terms it's estimated that the royalty brings Rinehart an annual revenue of about $US107m a year.</p><p>But since Lang's death, Rinehart has built Hancock Prospecting into an important player in the Australian resources boom. As well as 50% of the massive Hope Downs mine, she owns another huge mine in the Pilbara, Roy Hill, which is expected to begin exporting in 2014. She also has other investments in exploration for uranium, lead, gold, diamonds and petroleum.</p><p>The power of the mining and resources industry is reshaping the Australian economy. As the world's largest exporter of iron ore and coal (much of it bound for China and Japan), rising commodity prices have brought increased profits which in turn have buoyed the economy.</p><p>Australia was one of the few developed countries to escape recession during the global financial crisis – because mining filled the national coffers and kept the economy strong.</p><p>Rinehart sees the resources sector as the future of the Australian economy and her views on the Labor government's plans to increase taxes on mining profits are well known. In 2010, she donned some expensive-looking pearls and shouted \"Axe the tax\" from the back of a flat-bed truck in Perth.</p><p>A former West Australian attorney general , Jim McGinty, told the Age newspaper that the image of her splashed across media outlets left an indelible impression. \"All I could think of was Gordon Gekko shouting 'greed is good',\" he said. \"Gina was basically saying 'I don't want to pay my fair share of tax.'\"</p><p>She got her message across. Two weeks later, the then prime minister and chief proponent of the tax, Kevin Rudd, was dumped by his party. A much watered-down version of the tax is due to pass the senate early this year.</p><p>Rinehart has always guarded her privacy carefully. She is rarely seen out and about in Perth and refuses almost all interview requests. So do her friends. Others fear they will be sued if they speak against her.</p><p>But her recent foray into media ownership has cast a spotlight on her – and on a bitter family feud with three of her four children that would not be out of place in a Hollywood script.</p><p>Rinehart's three oldest children are trying to have her removed as the head of a family trust set up by Lang Hancock. The trust owns almost a quarter of Hancock Prospecting.</p><p>She has sought orders in two courts (including the high court) to have details of the dispute suppressed. But last Friday some details spilled out in court, including a security report commissioned by Rinehart that argued her four children and five grandchildren faced heightened security risks, including kidnapping, murder and terrorism as a result of the publicity surrounding the dispute over the family trust.</p><p>Rinehart's eldest child, John, launched a blistering attack on his mother the next day. \"I can support my wife and children in a modest manner from the work I do but I can't provide the level of funds required to deal with security issues – real or imagined – associated with begin the son of a woman worth more than $A20bn,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>\"When my mother buys a few hundred million dollars worth of Fairfax, it's going to draw some attention,\" he continued. \"But she won't share a penny to help protect he grandchildren from the risks she – the trustee of our family trust – is creating by her own actions. What more can I do than communicate to any kidnappers out there – over my dead body and you will be wasting your time anyway. If you think you are going to get anything from my mother, good luck.\"</p><p>Emails revealed in court showed her other children had requested money for bodyguards, chefs and housekeepers.</p><p>\"I don't think you understand what it means now that the whole world thinks you're going to be wealthier than Bill Gates – It means we all need bodyguards and very safe homes!!\" wrote Hope Rinehart.</p><p>However the dispute with her children is settled, Rinehart's colossal wealth means she will continue to make and indelible mark on Australian life – both economically and, with her recent acquisition, through the media too.</p>","headline":"Gina Rinehart, Australian mining magnate and now media mogul","trailText":"One of the world's richest women has bought into the Australian media.

Some reports said Britons were also aboard.</p><p>Ken Talbot, who made his fortune in coal mining in Queensland, was among nine passengers on the plane chartered by Sundance Resources, a Perth-based iron ore company, the firm <a href=\"http://www.sundanceresources.com.au/media/32885/media%20announcement%20-%20air%20incident%20update%202.pdf\" title=\"\">said in a statement</a>. The plane disappeared yesterday as it flew from the Cameroon capital, Yaoundé, to the neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville, where the firm has mining interests.</p><p>Talbot is a non-executive director of Sundance and his investment company, Talbot Group, owns almost a fifth of it. Also on the plane were Sundance's chief executive, chairman, company secretary and two other non-executive directors.</p><p>Separately, Talbot's company named a seventh passenger as one of its own executives, Natasha Flason Brian, who is from France but lives in Australia. The plane is said to have had two crew.</p><p>Some local reports said British nationals were believed to be among the others missing. The Foreign Office in London said it was aware of the reports.</p><p>A search was launched this morning involving planes from Cameroon and Congo. \"The families of the missing have been notified and are being supported during this deeply distressing time,\" Sundance said, adding that the company had asked Australia's stock market to halt trading in its shares.</p><p>Australia's foreign minister, Stephen Smith, said six Australians were confirmed as being on the flight, which was travelling over a region of dense jungle. \"We are seriously concerned about their safety and wellbeing,\" he said.</p><p>A spokesman for Talbot Group said they had not heard from Talbot for 24 hours and \"we're keeping our fingers crossed\". He told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"It's a very remote part of the world, where communications are at very best satellite communications only. Until the search party gets out there, which has just happened, we're not sure.\"</p><p>Talbot, the son of a New South Wales truck driver, was a mining executive for decades before setting up his own venture, Macarthur Coal, in 1995. Just seven years later, it floated on stock markets with a value of almost £2bn. He later sold his stake and has a personal fortune estimated at nearly AU$1bn (£585m), with luxury homes in locations including Paris and Lake Como, Italy.</p><p>Rather than retire, he set up Talbot Group to look for new investments, saying: \"All I know is the coal industry. If I was not working in the coal industry I would get bored.\"</p><p>Talbot hit controversy when a Queensland state MP, Gordon Nuttall, was accused of corruptly accepting about £175,000 from him. Nuttall was jailed in 2009 for seven years. Talbot was due to appear in court this August charged with making corrupt payments, which he denied.</p><p>Sundance's main business venture in the region is the huge Mbalam project in the far south of Cameroon, stretching into Congo-Brazzaville.</p>","headline":"Australian mining tycoon Ken Talbot goes missing over Africa","trailText":"Britons reportedly among 11 on chartered flight from Cameroon to Congo-Brazzaville","newspaperPageNumber":"21","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/6/20/1277073499429/Ken-Talbot-002.jpg","wordcount":"472","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"363967517","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3500756","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Peter Walker","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-06-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1415468","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-06-23T22:38:41Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/20/australian-mining-tycoon-ken-talbot-missing-africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jun/20/australian-mining-tycoon-ken-talbot-missing-africa","tags":[{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"business/mining","webTitle":"Mining","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/mining","references":[]},{"id":"world/cameroon","webTitle":"Cameroon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cameroon","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/cameroon","references":[]},{"id":"world/congo-brazzaville","webTitle":"Congo Brazzaville","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo-brazzaville","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/congo-brazzaville","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

It has been mismanaged for years and we are now at a tipping point.\"</p><p>Both the federal Australian and state Queensland governments have launched their own 18-month assessments of the reef, although ministers have come under fire for considering several large developments, including Abbott Point, during the review.</p><p>Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, has defended his handling of the issue, telling ABC Radio: \"Let's not forget, with Abbot Point, there is already a significant level of industry that occurs there.\"</p><p>\"One of the largest levels of concern here is shipping, as the vessels move through the reef area.

This produces a net approval rate of minus 21%, compared with minus 7% on 4-6 April.</p><p>Over the same period, Bill Shorten's net satisfaction rating as opposition leader improved from minus 11% to minus 6%. He was preferred prime minister by 38% of those polled, nearly level with 40% for Abbott. Newspoll had a 3% stated margin of error.</p><p>The Newspoll showed a 10-point decline in the Coalition's support among people aged over 65 years and six-point drop in the age group 50 to 64, coinciding with debates over increasing the pension age and changes to entitlements.</p><p>\"What we did notice was a fairly stronger effect among older voters, so it would be fairly safe to assume that [the] pension age, the issues around the family home going into the calculations for pension entitlements and possibly the Medicare co-payment, all of which have been talked about but yet to be announced in the budget, probably would affect older Australians,\" the Newspoll chief executive, Martin O'Shannessy, told the ABC on Tuesday.</p><p>Abbott sought to play down the government’s opinion poll slump on Monday, saying the budget would be framed in a fair way.</p><p>He dismissed claims of a broken promise over the proposed deficit levy, saying the “most fundamental commitment of all was to get Labor's debt and deficit disaster under control”.</p><p>“No one likes difficult decisions – governments don’t like taking difficult decisions, voters don’t like the consequences of difficult decisions – but you’ve just got to make hard decisions at a time like this, otherwise our country is doomed to years of economic stagnation,” Abbott told the Nine Network.</p><p>“I think in the long run, the voters will thank us for doing what is absolutely necessary if Labor’s debt and deficit disaster is to be tackled.”</p><p>Shorten said Abbott’s first major economic statement was “shaping up to be a budget of broken promises and twisted priorities” including increased income taxes and “a new GP tax for the sick”.</p><p>“And yet Tony Abbott has said today that Australians should be thanking him for these problems – for the extra pressure on families, the extra taxes, the extra fears which pensioners now have,” Shorten said.</p><p>“Prime minister, Australians will not be thanking you for your broken promises.”</p>","headline":"Tony Abbott's popularity plunges, latest polls show","trailText":"Labor's lead strengthens to 53%-47% after preferences, Newspoll says, as satisfaction

It shows that while the employment boom in mining has certainly ended, in Queensland a different mining boom has brought some job growth. Overall, however, the decline of the manufacturing industry and the rising employment in the services sector continues.</p><p>In May, for the first time in Australia’s history, there were more people employed in the professional, scientific and technical services industry than in manufacturing. It also won’t be very long until the number employed in manufacturing is surpassed by those working in the education and training industry:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment by industry\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/odj3t/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since 2002, manufacturing has gone from the biggest employer to now the fifth biggest behind health care, retail trade, construction and now professional, scientific and technical services.</p><p>The decline of manufacturing is part of a long-term trend that has seen our economy become much broader – and shifted from making things to more services oriented. Thirty years ago a third of the workforce was employed in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, electricity and gas or the construction industries; now it is about 23%.<b><br></b></p><p>Along with this long-term trend, however ,has been the change to the labour market that has occurred during and after the mining boom. The second mining boom took off in 2009 when iron ore prices rose by more than 30% in a year. It led to a boom in investment that peaked in September 2012.<b><br></b></p><p>It took a few months in 2009 for the industry to react to the increase in prices, but by August 2009 the drop in mining employment that occurred during the GFC had begun to turn around. Thus to see the impact of both the boom and since its end we can look at employment growth in each industry from August 2009 to August 2012, and the growth since August 2012:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment growth by industry during and after the mining boom\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/bQQLT/5/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>From 2009 to 2012, employment in the mining industry soared nearly 70%. It left all other<b><br></b></p><p>industries well behind. But employment in most industries did grow during this period. Five industries, however, experienced a decline in employment – agriculture, manufacturing, transport and postal, wholesale trade, and construction. </p><p>The change since the end of the boom is quite stark. Since the second half of 2012, employment in mining has actually fallen. The biggest growth industry is the nebulous “other services”; the big growth sector in this industry was in “repair and maintenance services” .<b><br></b></p><p>But of the five industries that declined in employment during the boom, only two have continued to fall since August 2012: wholesale trade and manufacturing. The big falls in the wholesale trade sector have occurred in the grocery, liquor and tobacco product wholesaling sector and, not coincidentally given the drop in the manufacturing industry and the end of the mining investment boom, in the machinery and equipment wholesaling sector. In the manufacturing industry the losses were across the board, with only wood products manufacturing surviving relatively unscathed.<b><br></b></p><p>It’s worth noting the industry to shrink the most employees since 2012 is the information media and telecommunications industry. And it will neither please nor surprise any of my colleagues to discover the biggest contributor to this loss has been in publishing, which includes newspaper and magazine publishing.<b><br></b></p><p>In light of the decline in employment in the mining industry perhaps the biggest surprise in the past year has been the strong jobs growth in both Western Australia and Queensland:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual employment growth by state\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/TjPC7/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Aside from the large growth in Northern Territory (which comes off a small base of just 130,000 workers) both WA and Queensland have been the strong performers over the past year. But the two states are performing well for different reasons. In WA, the housing boom which has seen house prices in Perth increase by 14% in the past two years (second only to Sydney) has also seen employment in the rental, hiring and real estat<b><br></b></p><p>industry growth the most in the past 12 months. Highlighting the change in the mining economy since 2012, although employment in WA is growing as well as any other state, employment in mining in WA in the past year has fallen by 5%. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"WA and QLD annual employment growth\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/pTKR4/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In Queensland, however, mining employment continues to grow. So, too, in Queensland does employment in manufacturing – making it, with South Australia, the only state to observe an increase in manufacturing employment in the past 12 months. The difference in employment in mining jobs in Queensland and WA highlights the different sectors of the industry:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mining employment\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/4QVnc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>WA</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decline in mining jobs in WA matches the fall in investment, and yet Queensland mining jobs appear to buck this connection. That is mostly because the growth sectors of the industry have changed. From 2009 to 2012 the boom in jobs was in the metal ore mining sector – the increase of 40,000 jobs in that sector accounted for nearly half of all new mining jobs in that time:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mining industry employment growth\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/gNfVX/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since 2012, however, the biggest growth sector in the industry has been in oil and gas extraction. As I noted in March, coal seam gas exploration and production in Queensland is cranking up in order to begin a massive boost in exports over the next few years. But it would be folly to hope that coal seam gas will directly lead to a boom in overall employment. Oil and gas extraction accounts for only about 9% of all mining employment.<b><br></b></p><p>While the boom of 2009-2012 brought more jobs in mining, the future for employment in Australia looks set to be in the services sector as the health, professional and education sectors continue to grow.<b><br></b></p>","headline":"Services sector jobs go ahead in leaps and bounds after mining

Black gold. Coal from this part of central Queensland – home to the country's biggest deposits – is driving the economy to set new records.</p><p>\"Huge just doesn't do it justice,\" says a recent Deloitte Access Economics report on the state's resources boom. \"Humungous might bring us closer to the mark.\" Deloitte's Chris Richardson says Australia has been riding in the slipstream of China and other emerging economies. \"We have opportunities that the likes of the UK and others don't to sell our resources in a period where half the world is having an industrial revolution. That's magnificent for us.\"</p><p>But when the London-listed miner BHP Billiton this week<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/22/bhp-billiton-olympic-dam-china\" title=\"\"> shelved plans to build the world's biggest open-pit copper and uranium mine in south Australia</a>, the Sydney Morning Herald website ran the headline: \"The bubble has burst.\" BHP said it was a financial decision based on slowing demand and the high price of expansion in Australia, with its tight labour market and high exchange rate.</p><p>This year the minerals and resources industry will account for 8.5% of Australia's GDP, compared with the long-term average of less than 2%. It will make up more than half of the country's export income. Australia is the world's biggest exporter of coal and iron ore.</p><p>The industry has shielded the country from the economic storms that have buffeted Europe and the US. Saul Eslake, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (Australia), says the country's strong financial position is a combination of good luck and good management. \"What China is doing for our exports is not a result of anything politicians have done in Canberra – but we have also had good monetary policy backed up by good, prudential management of our banks. Unlike most other western countries, who ran deficits during the boom years, Australia ran surpluses, which put it in a very strong position to deal with the financial crisis when it came.\"</p><p>Australia remains one of only eight countries worldwide to hold AAA sovereign debt ratings from all three main ratings agencies. While much of Europe is mired in crisis, unemployment in Australia is 5.1%, inflation stands at 1.2%, official interest rates are 3.5% and growth is predicted to be 3.1% in 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund, compared with 0.2% in Britain.</p><p>The strong economy, however, has not brought benefits to all sectors. At Mission Beach in north Queensland, an hour and a half's drive south of the barrier reef hub of Cairns, Atalanta Willy is preparing to take a small group of tourists on a half-day sea-kayaking trip to a nearby tropical island. \"Many small towns like this are only just keeping their heads above water,\" she says.</p><p>Strong economic fundamentals and the mining boom have pushed the Australian dollar to sustained highs, hurting industries such as tourism. Five years ago £1 bought you A$2.50; today it's closer to A$1.50.</p><p>\"The foreign tourists that come through here find it unbelievably expensive,\" says Willy. Full- or half-day sea kayaking trips were once the backbone of her business, but demand is much lower now. \"Tourists used to have more money in their pockets and stay a bit longer. Now the high dollar means they're moving through towns like this much faster.\" Shops and cafes in the small community have closed. Last year Willy's husband, David Tofler, went back to work as a sound recordist to supplement their income. He's likely to do it again in the upcoming wet season.</p><h2>Catastrophic</h2><p>Across north Queensland it's a similar picture. Tourism in the area fell 8% in the year to March, with substantial dropoffs in the lucrative European backpacker market, down 18%. The numbers of Japanese tourists, who make up more than half of all visitors to the state, fell at the same rate.</p><p>\"It's been catastrophic for some businesses and many have hung on for dear life,\" says Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. In Cairns, which for years has thrived on tourism, unemployment is 8.3%, well above the national average.</p><p>Manufacturing has also been a significant loser in Australia's two-speed economy. Manufacturers have been reporting falling output since March and the latest Australian Industry Group's monthly index for industrial performance, in July, showed a sharp 6.9-point fall to 40.3 points – the lowest level since the global financial crisis began.</p><p>The high dollar has hit export-reliant industries such as steel and aluminium, making them uncompetitive internationally. Job losses have been painful, the majority coming in the south-east corner of the country, far away from the mining boom. It has dampened consumer confidence in those areas, which in turn has hit other manufacturers. Last month Ford laid off 440 workers at its plants in Victoria.</p><p>By contrast, mining projects in the remote parts of north-western Australia face skills shortages. In May, the world's richest woman (and Australia's wealthiest miner), Gina Rinehart, won the right to bring in 1,700 foreign workers for the construction of an iron ore mine in Pilbara. The move, which enraged union officials, demonstrates the lopsided nature of the Australian economy and the difficulty mining companies have in persuading workers to leave their homes in Sydney and Melbourne.</p><p>So what of the future? \"There has never been a boom which goes on forever,\" says Deloitte's Richardson. \"By the standards of booms, this one is already pretty old and will go for some time given the sheer size of the seismic shift under way in places like China and India, with people moving off farms and into factories.\"</p><p>Eslake thinks the mining boom has another decade to run, and says the real challenge will come after that. \"The history of Japan and Korea tells us that the intensity of demand for commodities falls away once a country reaches per capita income somewhere between US$18,000 and US$25,000 (£11,000-£16,000). In China, I think that's about a decade away.</p><p>\"The challenge then will be what else we can sell to the Chinese when they don't want our minerals. The answer won't be manufacturing but is more likely to be some sort of agricultural products and services.\"</p><p>In the meantime, Australians can only be grateful that they don't face the sorts of economic challenges that Europe&nbsp;does.</p>","headline":"In Australia's two-speed economy, mining booms but tourism suffers","trailText":"The mining industry has helped shield Australia from the global financial crisis, but the strong economy has not benefited all","newspaperPageNumber":"33","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345725133384/Mount-Isa-Mines-in-Queens-005.jpg","wordcount":"1035","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"395095449","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6483020","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alison Rourke in Mission Beach","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1791624","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-26T12:51:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/23/australia-two-speed-economy-mining-tourism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/aug/23/australia-two-speed-economy-mining-tourism","tags":[{"id":"business/mining","webTitle":"Mining","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/mining","references":[]},{"id":"business/travelleisure","webTitle":"Travel & leisure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/travelleisure","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/travelleisure","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alison-rourke","webTitle":"Alison Rourke","r2ContributorId":"39677","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/25/1372160236561/Alison-Rourke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Rourke has written for The Guardian and The Observer newspapers since 2010.

Some days he mows lawns, other days he’ll do a spot of welding. He wants to train as a mechanic, but there are no suitable programs in the area. What he doesn’t want to do, he says, is work in the local mine.</p><p>“Rio Tinto has come in, destroyed our land and given us money for it,” he says. “I don’t want them coming in and digging everything up, destroying nature. They are affecting our water and killing all the fish. I think the country is more important than that.”</p><p>Peters’ home of Gapuwiyak is one of the small missionary-founded communities here, small specks dotted on the gargantuan tapestry of incandescent rocks, rivers and forests that make up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land\">Arnhem Land</a>, an area larger than Portugal but with a population a little over 16,000.</p><p>This is<a href=\"http://www.dhimurru.com.au/yolngu-culture.html\"> Yolngu land</a>, they’ve been living on it for more than 40,000 years. But here on the Gove peninsula, this is also a land shaped by mining, most recently since behemoth Rio Tinto bought into the area in 2007.</p><p>The Yolngu fought to stop the establishment of the bauxite mine and the associated alumina refinery – set up in 1963 by Nabalco, which was later renamed Alcan Gove and bought by Rio Tinto. Famously, bark petitions from the Yolngu of Yirrkala were delivered to parliament, where they now hang.<br></p><p>The totemic case, the first documented recognition of Indigenous people in Australian law, was an opening salvo in the ultimately successful push for land rights. But the court ruled against the Yolngu on the matter of the mine, and in 1963 the mine came, and an entire town – Nhulunbuy – was built to service it.</p><p>Since then a 22,000-hectare principality has been carved out – an area larger than Washington DC – in Yolngu land. Rio Tinto effectively runs Nhulunbuy, which sits on the same excised area as the bauxite mine, a hulking structure that shuttles 8.2m tonnes of rust-red dirt a year to the refinery via a snaking 20km conveyor belt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5a6447b7-4ee6-4141-bbbd-16c598a80ee7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407725540647/4b3e4b3a-60ac-43a9-825f-7a1bd330726d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nhulunbuy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A conveyor belt stretches for more than 20km, ferrying mined bauxite between the Gove mine and the refinery. The bauxite will now be sent directly to Nhulunbuy’s port for transport. Photograph: Monica Tan for the Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And now, despite their early opposition, many Yolngu have come to depend on Rio Tinto, or rather what flows from it.</p><p>This is why Rio Tinto’s decision <a href=\"http://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_9427.aspx\">to close its Gove refinery</a> has sent shockwaves through the area. </p><p>While the refinery didn’t employ many Yolngu, it was the raison d’etre for vital services in the area, from the hospital to the electricity to the food that is shipped into the Rio Tinto-owned port.</p><p>The refinery closed in July; 1,100 workers were made redundant. People now worry about what Rio Tinto could still take away, because Nhulunbuy is a company town in almost everything but name. The power station, the port facilities, the warehouses, the fuel storage facilities and the airport all sit on Rio Tinto’s lease.</p><p>Vast chunks of infrastructure could potentially depart; there are concerns the supermarket and bank could follow suit, despite assurances to the contrary. People are worried the hospital could be in danger. The NT government says cryptically it will assess what the “impact of Rio’s decision is on the future health demands of Nhulunbuy and the east Arnhem region”.</p><p>“If they take things away from us, we’ll have no money,” says Peters. “I’m worried about everything going. I’m worried that they will take the principal away from our local school. He grew up here.”</p><p>It wasn’t meant to be like this. Just three years ago, Rio Tinto promised “long-term intergenerational benefits” from an <a href=\"http://www.riotintoalcan.com/ENG/media/media_releases_1966.asp\">agreement struck</a> with Gumatj elder Galarrwuy Yunupingu and senior Rirratjingu figure Bakamumu Marika, representing the two key Yolngu clans.</p><p>It was the first agreement of its kind signed between traditional owners and a mining company – “Rio found its conscience”, as a negotiator for the clans recalls it.</p><p>For the previous 40 years, the federal government had compensated the Yolngu for having their land forcibly removed and then ripped apart by metallic teeth and arms. Payments amounted to $3m in 2010.</p><p>By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=5599\">the handsome new deal</a> was to provide between $15m and $18m a year, depending on the price of bauxite, until 2053. The money was paid to funds run by the Gumatj and the Rirratjingu to fund medical, retail and residential developments, as well as forge employment opportunities.</p><p>But almost immediately the difficulties hit. The mining boom unhelpfully forced up the Australian dollar. The bauxite price then dipped and the NT government reneged on a deal to fund an epic 1,000km gas pipeline from Katherine to Gove to power the refinery, citing a $3bn risk to taxpayers.</p><p>Rio Tinto insists the agreement with the Yolngu remains in place after the refinery closure, although the confidentiality of the deal’s details mean it is unclear whether the payments will continue as before. All of this has left the communities here confused about what the future holds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9a7f473e-59b3-4538-9254-058b2079ef8c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407726252403/2781158c-7bba-468e-a929-a2ce02144e07-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nhulunbuy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Then Indigenous affairs minister Jenny Macklin, Galarrwuy Yunupingu and prime minister Julia Gillard sit at the official signing of a historic 42-year mining agreement between traditional owners and Rio Tinto in 2011.

Neatly trimmed, verdant front lawns sit beside boat trailers in the driveways. Parents usher their floppy hat-wearing children in and out of a neat primary school, while a few Rio Tinto workers mill about their rather spartan company accommodation camp in the centre of town.</p><p>The town’s population of 4,000 will slump by as much as half when all the Rio Tinto workers and their families leave, with most set to depart by January.</p><p>The effects of the exodus are already being felt. Qantas, which is to cease its regional flights to and from Nhulunbuy’s airport, has put up its company-owned houses for sale. A fabric shop open for the past decade will be shutting. “It seems like the right time to go,” the owner says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9e604803-3c60-456e-9e19-98d6aaea2cbc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407725160238/f26889e6-2943-4993-a623-345382fc860e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nhulunbuy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Qantas, which is halting its Darwin-Gove-Cairns route, is busy selling company houses in Nhulunbuy. Photograph: Monica Tan for the Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few houses lie empty. More will follow. Locals talk about a family spending $700,000 on a house that is suddenly worth $250,000.</p><p>Meanwhile Rio Tinto has committed 250 of its now-dormant properties to a project that aims to bring in new residents – namely, Yolngu people. If the town is to survive, it will be in an altered state, both economically and socially.</p><p>“Everything here is hooked up for Rio Tinto: the power, water, everything,” says a resident who has lived in the town for several decades. “They say the power station will stay but I saw them bring in diesel generators a couple of days ago. There’s a complete lack of information from the company.”</p><p>The resident fears the change to come. “If the Yolngu people come in, it will change things a lot around here. It’s 99% white at the moment … we’ll see the crime rate go through the roof, it’ll be like Alice Springs or Tennant Creek here.”</p><p>Racial divisions, and tensions, are hard to ignore here. Practically no Indigenous people worked at the Gove refinery, yet the Yolngu people have been on the receiving end of the benefits – infrastructure, and payments to the two main clan groups – and the ignominies – the alcohol dependency, the suicide – that have come with the mine, both directly and indirectly.</p><p>The Yolngu didn’t want alcohol to be on sale in Nhulunbuy, but it is. Now parts of the beach at nearby Yirrkala, a Yolngu-dominated township where alcohol is banned, have a shimmering blanket of used Victoria Bitter cans.</p><h2>Charting a future</h2><p>Klaus Helms is a stout balanda, or non-Indigenous person, with a shock of white hair. Having worked alongside Yolngu people since his arrival on the Gove peninsula in 1969, Helms is now the chief executive of the Gumatj Corporation.</p><p>“If Nhulunbuy is to survive, they will need about a 30% increase in Yolngu people in the town,” he says. “Some people will be very uncomfortable with that change. But you know what, it’s called tough luck. It’s Indigenous land.”</p><p>The clan that put its trust in Helms call him “detun”, or buffalo, due to his frequent, gruff collisions with Rio Tinto and its predecessors in the area. His job is to help plot a future for the Gumatj.</p><p>“We need to hold on to as much infrastructure as possible and we need to think about what we need to do to survive,” he says. “I say the word survive, not thrive. If we’re not careful we’ll lose what’s left. It’s OK for Rio Tinto workers – they’ve got a big payout and they’ve left. We’re still here.”</p><p>While Helms wants to ensure essentials such as electricity remain, he sees an opportunity to diversify into new areas, albeit still primary industries – forestry on Rio Tinto’s rehabilitated mine area, development of pockets of gas and manganese. The Gumatj Corporation has an exploration licence for its own bauxite project, in a bid to wrest greater autonomy over the benefits of mining for local people.</p><p>A $2.5m <a href=\"http://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_11465.aspx\">mining training centre</a>, funded by Rio Tinto, will take on about 30 Yolngu to improve their skills. About 20 are already involved in the existing bauxite mine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8699e6cc-d6e5-4869-83ed-59d7699dbe7c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407725338972/630e569d-8424-41b2-8dc3-cddc56cf04f3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nhulunbuy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A fast food outlet in Nhulunbuy. Photograph: Monica Tan for the Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“What kind of deal can you do for a mine on your land if you don’t know anything about mining?” Helms says. “If you don’t know anything, you leave the deal to other people and that’s what we need to cut out – those middle people.”</p><p>Both the NT government and Rio Tinto have said they will not abandon the people left in Nhulunbuy. Rio Tinto says it will be increasing its bauxite mining, as well as ensuring vital services stay online and offering fresh investment into an economic development project to create new jobs.</p><p>In a speech at the annual Garma festival, Phil Edmands, managing director of Rio Tinto Australia, said the closure of the refinery was a “difficult but necessary” decision. “Rio Tinto remains committed to working in partnership with the traditional owners, businesses, governments and community organisations to help provide opportunities for Yolngu people in this region,” Edmands said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the NT government is continuing to talk up the prospects for north-east Arnhem Land, citing oil and gas exploration but also new opportunities, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/indigenous-homelands-opened-up-tourism-arnhem-land\">such as tourism</a>. “The local community has shown that it’s resilient and adaptable,” a government spokeswoman said. “People in the region have worked together to support one another and that is expected to continue.”</p><p>With about 90% of the NT covered by mining exploration licences, however, it is clear lessons need to be learned quickly if Indigenous people are to reap the long-term benefits they’ve been repeatedly promised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c3291678-1076-474c-bc42-d96649b45ee0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407726765886/7cdf6336-a6d3-4221-8a93-741f7eec5049-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nhulunbuy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Rio Tinto Australia’s managing director, Phil Edmands, and Gumatj Corporation deputy chairman Djawa Yunupingu at the announcement of a planned new mining training centre in Arnhem Land. Photograph: Yothu Yindi Foundation/AAP</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Morrison, the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.nlc.org.au\">Northern Land Council</a>, says: “A lot of other Aboriginal people around the country will have to deal with what happens when a mining company leaves.”</p><p>“We’ve seen the boom and bust that mining brings. Some people have done well, some have been marginalised and some have really struggled. In many places, during the mining boom Aboriginal people were left rotting in the streets.</p><p>“You can’t see mining as a panacea for Aboriginal ills when you look at the high rates of suicide and self-harm, for example. There are big, big social problems. It also brings pressure for people to live in two worlds – their Aboriginal culture and also the aspirations of the balanda.”</p><p>Australia’s grand experiment of handing dominion of remote towns to mining companies has social, as well as economic, implications. Ambitious visions during the boom years can lead to confusion and, sometimes, despair when the slump arrives. “The problem is that there is no plan to wind things down when the boom is over,” Morrison says. “I’ve got serious concern that there is no plan for Gove.</p><p>“The Aboriginal people haven’t gone anywhere for thousands of years. It’s the mining that came and went and the Aboriginal people are the ones left with the question of ‘what now?’ ”</p><p>There remains the possibility of a smart, diverse economy for Indigenous people, rather than simply tearing asunder the vast red dirt of the NT for minerals.</p><p>“There are things like tourism and cottage industries selling bush products such as soap,” Morrison suggests. “These kinds of things intersect with cultural knowledge and they involve women and children, which isn’t the case with mining. We need to think about our language and our customs as an advantage.”</p><p>Another legacy left by the refinery is an environmental one. Conservationists fret over whether contaminated wetlands can be returned to a semi-natural state, as well as the risk of a dangerous spill of the caustic soda used by the plant.</p><p>A Rio Tinto spokesman stresses that full-time staff will continue to monitor the ponds of toxic waste, with environmental management still a “key priority” for its operations.</p><p>But Dr Stuart Blanch , an NT environmental lawyer, says bauxite operations rarely leave behind a landscape that can be rehabilitated.</p><p>“The Gove refinery has ponds of toxic material and if that was released into the sea, from a flood or cyclone, that would be really bad news,” he says. “The real concern would be the marine environment, as the area is a relatively pristine one for sea turtles, dugongs and three species of endemic coastal dolphin.</p><p>“We want the refinery shut down and the toxins taken away, rather than it sitting there like an eyesore in the hope it may reopen.”</p><p>Peters, the young mower-cum-welder from Gapuwiyak, would indeed like to escape the tentacles of mining. But, for now, there is little opportunity to be fussy.</p><p>When I tell him of the new Rio Tinto/Gumatj mining training centre, he leans forward, his eyes wide. Instinctive hostility to digging up this storied, tropical terrain collides with expediency.</p><p>“What?

It has got tougher in the last six to 12 months.\" </p><p>Ferguson's comments came after BHP announced it was indefinitely delaying the planned $20bn (£13bn) Olympic Dam copper expansion in South Australia and plans to build a new harbour, estimated at more than $20bn, to nearly double its iron ore exports in Western Australia, looking for cheaper alternatives. </p><p>But Ferguson's Labor party colleague Senator Penny Wong, the finance minister, disagreed with his assessment. \"We still have a lot of investment coming in to this country, about half a trillion dollars in the pipeline and more than half of that at the advanced stage,\" she told ABC News Breakfast.</p><p>\"I think the mining boom still has a long way to run. But what I would say is that the government has always assumed that the terms of trade would step down over time, that's what our budget is predicated on.</p><p>\"I think Mr Ferguson was referring to when the terms of trade peaked, and that's factored into the Government's budget.\"</p><p>Ferguson later released a statement rowing back from what he had initially said. \"The commodity price boom is over but in terms of investment in Australia the boom continues,\" he said.</p><p>Fuelled by Chinese-led demand for coal, iron ore and other resources, Australia's economy was one of the very few in the developed world to sail through the global financial crisis without sliding into recession. </p><p>The resources boom fuelled what has been dubbed a two-speed economy, which has pumped up the Australian dollar and exacerbated the pain felt in manufacturing sectors and retail in Australia's most populous states. </p><p>While manufacturers like Ford and Bluescope Steel have shut down plants and axed jobs, Australia's unemployment level has stayed around 5% thanks to substantial jobs growth in resources projects, where truck drivers command six-figure pay packets. </p><p>Politicians may be worried the whole economy is moving into the slow lane but analysts say the fear is premature, as energy projects, underpinned by customers who have already been locked in, will continue full steam ahead. </p><p>\"A marriage of our macroeconomic research with analysis of already committed and possible projects has confirmed our expectations that a peak is coming, but is yet to arrive,\" National Australia Bank economists said in a report. </p><p>NAB expects the resources boom to peak in 2013 and 2014, when resource capital spending will be around 1% of gross domestic product higher than now. </p><p>BHP put the Olympic Dam expansion on hold as it reported a 35% slide in second-half profit, the biggest sign of the pain inflicted by the slowdown in China's economic growth.</p><p>Weaker demand from China has knocked prices of all key commodities, including iron ore, languishing at its lowest levels since December 2009, copper, coal and aluminium, clouding the outlook for all miners. </p><p>In response to pressure from shareholders worried about poor returns in a weak global markets, miners have put the brakes on capital spending, with BHP on Wednesday announcing it would not sanction any major new projects in the year to June 2013. </p><p>The Olympic Dam project, which had been due for approval by December 2012, would have created 25,000 jobs, according to the South Australian government. </p><p>\"The next round was always going to be difficult and I must say Olympic Dam was always a very, very challenging project – its sheer size,\" Ferguson said. </p><p>He said he still hoped the project could go ahead. \"Our requirement now is to continue to work together in partnership, South Australian and Australian governments, with BHP Billiton to actually get this project in place,\" he said.</p>","headline":"Australian minister declares end of mining resources boom","trailText":"<p>Labor's Martin Ferguson says mining boom has peaked after BHP Billiton delayed

Under the so-called \"two strikes\" rule, if more than 25% of shareholders vote down the executive pay scheme for two consecutive years the board can be thrown out and new elections held. </p><p>BlueScope Steel boss PaulO'Malley got in early last week, saying he would not claim his performance bonus or salary increase to take responsibility for a $1.04bn ($1.09bn) full-year loss.

$244m, its first loss since privatisation in 1995, and in line with expectations of a $248m loss.</p><p>The carrier has embarked on a five-year turnaround strategy announced last year to improve its
