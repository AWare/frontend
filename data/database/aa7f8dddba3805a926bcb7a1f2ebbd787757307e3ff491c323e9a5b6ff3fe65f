But here we are. Episode two of this \"will they be able to successfully open a restaurant business\" show saw host Russell Norman travel to a sweet-looking part of Gloucestershire. </p><p>His mission: sort out a couple – Dave and Debbie – who were trying to open a gastropub in a pretty rural-looking area, and aiming to charge £25 a pop for steaks. Hmm. After much defensive interrupting from Dave, and sighing from Debbie, they lowered their prices and served up farm-to-plate dishes that made me crave a proper steak dinner. </p><p>Lesson learned? Don't over-romanticise opening a pub, basically. It sucks.</p><h2>Secrets of South America: Extreme Beauty Queens, 9pm on BBC3<br></h2><p>Model/presenter/journalist Billie JD Porter travelled to Venezuela to try and understand the country's obsession with cosmetic surgery and beauty pagents. This basically tried to cover too many topics at once (beauty standards! Feminism! Huge Chavez! Socialism? Patriarchy!) without having the time to closely examine any one.</p><p>Plus, Billie's deadpan delivery proved hard to watch. Osmel Sousa, the so-called \"Tsar of beauty\", was the star of the show, and that's really saying something. He basically gets to decide who is and isn't hot enough to try and compete in the Miss Venezuela pageant, and happily lists off cosmetic surgeries women should have to be considered eligible. Charmer.</p><p>Finally, I attempted to lighten things up with something called the Magaluf Weekender on ITV2 but just… no.<br></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52f35749e4b0ab978b0f9780\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-06T10:22:53.839Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">What went down as you slept</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87f321fb-8db0-4e06-a78a-fc192d401c00\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679688894/bc61d4c9-8c62-412c-8b66-213f93318dcc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The four main stars of Mean Girls, 2004.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Hashtag never forget the glory of the Mean Girls-era flip phone.

He recalled, twinkly-eyed, how as a kid he had begged his parents to let him watch the show under its then host Johnny Carson “because I knew it was on really late and I was getting away with something”.<br></p><p>When Fallon takes over the reigns from Jay Leno, who broadcasts his final Tonight Show after 22 years on Thursday night, he knows that much more is at stake than childhood nostalgia. He faces the supreme challenge of instilling in a new generation of young Americans that same mildly naughty desire to stay up late and watch him.</p><p>There is a great deal riding on that, including nothing less than the sustainability of the late-night comedy genre that was pioneered by the Tonight Show in 1954 but is now a pale reflection of its former glory, battered by fierce competition from Jon Stewart’s Daily Show and the like as well as the chill blast of the internet.  The financial wellbeing of NBC is also in play, with advertising revenue slumping almost to half its 2007 level by 2012 to <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/21/entertainment/la-et-ct-jimmy-fallon-late-night-20130321\">below $150m</a>.</p><p>Then there’s the fate of the 40-year-old Fallon himself, who graduates from his current late-night slot to the Tonight Show on 17 February. Will he mature into the job to become another feature of the US cultural landscape, his face carved into the Mount Rushmore of late-night comedy alongside Carson, who hosted 4,531 episodes of the Tonight Show, and Leno, who has hosted 4,610 since 1992?</p><p>Or will he crash out like Conan O’Brien, whose catastrophic attempt to replace Leno came to a <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-says-he-wont-do-tonight-show-following-leno/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">spectacular end in 2010</a> after just 146 episodes?</p><p>Bill Carter, author of The War for Late Night, and who reports on television for the New York Times, gives Fallon two or three years to prove himself. “He has to keep the Tonight Show in its number one slot. But he also has to be hip enough to get the critical reaction that NBC wants – Jay Leno had lost that entirely; he was denigrated by critics for being too mainstream.”</p><p>On one level, Fallon’s brand of comedy is quite conventional, as befits an alumnus of Saturday Night Live who quit in 2004 to mount a failed bid to break into Hollywood. He has largely dispensed with the irony bordering on sarcasm on which so much modern comedy depends, returning instead to a prelapsarian humour drawing on his good-natured style and taste in silly costumes. On the other hand, he is a master at divining what will go viral – a crucial skill in the age of TV recording devices and social media.</p><p>Take his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/chris-christie-aide-new-jersey-lane-closing \">recent lampoon </a>of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor under fire because of those traffic problems over the George Washington bridge. Fallon’s remake of Born To Run, in which he mimics Bruce Springsteen and is then joined on stage by the Boss himself, was not just sublime television, but had the benefit of attracting more than 4 million views on YouTube<a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-says-he-wont-do-tonight-show-following-leno/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\"> </a></p><p>His riff on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA \">hashtags</a> with Justin Timberlake<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA\"> </a>has been viewed more than 21m times on YouTube, and his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ajQ-foj2Q \">lip sync battle</a> with Stephen Merchant almost 11m times. Both were helped along the way by Fallon’s 11m Twitter followers.</p><p>Eric Deggans, TV critic for National Public Radio, says that Fallon’s popularity on social media is not a fluke, as his strain of humour is in tune with the 18-35 demographic that all late-night TV producers are desperate to reach. “He has a comedy that mixes up cultures and musical sounds in a way that feels distinctly millennial,” Deggans says.</p><p>Instead of a bland confected studio band, Fallon is supported by the hip-hop band the Roots. Instead of a faintly sycophantic guest interview with Barack Obama, Fallon persuaded the president last April to<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\"> “slow jam” the news</a> to the Roots’s R&amp;B backing, notching up another 8m views on YouTube . Instead of reciting a list of hit-or-miss jokes in the comfortable mould of his competitors, Fallon will perform a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\">“</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWsBirqxEjA\">history of rap</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\">”</a> with Timberlake<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWsBirqxEjA\"> </a> that is, depending on your taste, either strikingly accomplished or remarkably childish. Or both.</p><p>The billion-dollar question is whether Fallon’s social media largesse will feed back into ratings. The latest ratings figures from Nielsen have the Tonight Show hosting enjoying an average nightly audience of about 3.8 million people – well down from the 6 million Leno used to attract a decade ago.</p><p>The show remains the most viewed late-night programme, but among the most sought-after viewership of 18- to 49-year-olds, Jimmy Kimmel on ABC is gaining ground, and is now drawing nightly on average 0.9 million in that demographic compared to Leno’s 1.1m. That statistic alone helps explain NBC’s decision to finally – and presumably permanently this time – ditch its veteran star and jump a generation to Fallon.</p><p>As in so much of late-night television, age is key. The median age of Leno’s audience as he brings his era to a close is a shocking 57.8 years – on a par with his great rival David Letterman on CBS. Fallon and Kimmel hover around the 50-year mark, while only O’Brien paradoxically attracts an audience with a median age below 40.</p><p>O’Brien’s problem was that, though he performs well among the young, he alienated Leno’s ageing following, thus bringing the Tonight Show to the edge of the precipice of losing its prime position. Fallon will now be under pressure to hang on to as many loyal Leno viewers as he can, while gradually transitioning to a younger crowd.</p><p>“My hunch is that many of Leno’s older fans will not take readily to Jimmy Fallon and many will switch to Letterman,” cautions Deggans.</p><p>Despite the heavy task ahead, Fallon is going into the new job wearing his trademark cheery face. “I’ll do whatever it takes,” he told Vulture. “If you want me to sing, I’ll sing. You want me to dance, I’ll dance.

And it’s this: get out of New Zealand.</p><p>“Those news teams are idiots,” he sighs, referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/29/lorde-grammys-media-lecherous\">the media scrum that jostled her in the airport upon her recent return from the US</a>. “New Zealand had, up until that moment, been quite a good environment [for her] because people are not super celebrity-oriented, they pretty much leave you alone. But it keeps reaching this new critical mass and now with winning two Grammys, I think it’s getting pretty intense.” </p><p>Finn is no stranger to life as a celebrity – first when roped into his brother Tim’s band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/07/old-music-split-enz-message\">Split Enz</a> just as they were becoming an international concern, then enjoying even greater global success leading <a href=\"http://www.crowdedhouse.com/\">Crowded House</a>. So, in Finn’s opinion, what should Lorde do? </p><p>“I’d think she might go well moving to New York or something, where there are more famous people and less bother about it. It wouldn’t be a bad move to get among the centre of operations.”</p><p>The reason Finn is discussing the minutia of fame is the imminent release of his third solo album,<i> </i><a href=\"http://neilfinn.com/albums/solo/\">Dizzy Heights</a>. Its predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/15/featuresreview.review3\">One Nil</a>, was released in 2001 – but it’s not as though he’s been idle in the interim. <br></p><p>He’s released two albums under <a href=\"http://neilfinn.com/videos/7-worlds-collide/\">7 Worlds Collide</a> (a charity collaboration with the likes of Johnny Marr, Eddie Vedder and pretty much all of Wilco), 2004’s Finn Brothers album<i> </i><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/06/popandrock4\">Everyone is Here</a>, two reunion albums with Crowded House and last year’s self-titled release with the indie band he formed with wife Sharon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/25/neil-finn-pajama-club-crowded-house\">the Pajama Club</a>. </p><p>Throw in tours with all of the above, plus <a href=\"http://www.beat.com.au/music/paul-kelly-neil-finn-palais\">his theatre tour with Paul Kelly</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GN2KZaLsR4\">a song for the first of Peter Jackson’s<i> </i>Hobbit films</a>, and you can understand why he’s maybe had a few other things on his plate. And yet, “a lot of people are asking me why has it been over ten years since I’ve had a solo record,” he sighs. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2014/jan/08/neil-finn-white-lies-and-alibis-live-session-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2022271\"                data-video-name=\"Neil Finn performs White Lies and Alibis: live session – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/1/7/1389099227355/Neil-Finn-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-426482957\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/1/7/1389099215724/Neil-Finn-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/07/140107NeilFinn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/07/140107NeilFinn/140107NeilFinn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/07//140107NeilFinn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/07/140107NeilFinn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/07/140107NeilFinn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Neil Finn performs White Lies and Alibis in the Guardian's London office.</figcaption> </figure> <p>“And it’s obvious but it weirds me out a little bit because it doesn’t really feel like that in my head: you need to attach a name to something to give it a sense of identity, but it feels like one album after another in different contexts.”</p><p>The distinctions between Finn’s projust are also far from clear cut. The Crowded House reunion album<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/17/popandrock.shopping1\"><i> </i>Time on Earth </a>began life as a Finn solo disc with guest bass from Crowded House co-founder Nick Seymour.</p><p>However, “it just got to the point with that record where Nick got so involved with it and we were enjoying each other’s company, and it we went ‘it feels like a Crowded House album’. Most of the music could have been almost exactly the same with my name on it. Well, it<i> would</i> have been the same album, essentially.”</p><p>So there’s no distinction made when a song is written as to whether it’s a solo song or for some other project?</p><p>“No. Generally the pool is the pool and I’ll just draw from it. There is a few things that I park – for example, there are a few songs parked at the moment for a new Crowded House album, but for some reason I just didn’t feel like going the whole way with them at the moment.”</p><p>So there’s a new Crowded House album in the pipeline (“which I think will be really good,” he emphasises). In fact, Finn is thoroughly enjoying having a variety of options when it comes to writing. </p><p>“I believe in bands,” he says simply. “In some ways it makes the process more continuous and easer because you establish a pattern: you go to rehearsal, you try the new songs, you go home and you know how to finish them now because you’ve just played them.”</p><p>And how about solo?</p><p>“In that environment there are any number of possibilities, so it’s actually trickier – but leaves you more free to push boundaries and explore.”</p><p>How does having these sorts of options compare with the process when Crowded House was the sole creative outlet for every song? </p><p>“Well, we tried everything,” he shrugs. “We didn’t set restrictions for ourselves that much, though there were songs that didn’t suit the band and we didn’t play them very well. Strangely enough, thinking back, the first few times we tried to play <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9gKyRmic20&amp;feature=kp\">Don’t Dream it’s Over</a> we were<i> terrible</i>. We played it really badly.</p><p>“It took Mitchell [Froom, producer] suggesting a new way of approaching the bassline. And he put the organ on there – that was a big revelation. But we had to really learn how to play that song, and in the end we had to learn how to play other kinds of songs as well.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks_-25Fgh5U\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks_-25Fgh5U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>For<i> </i>Dizzy Heights Finn  had the best of both worlds: a solo album with a core band, but one he knew extremely well. In fact, he was directly responsible for two of them: his sons Elroy and Liam Finn.</p><p>“I spawned!” he laughs. “Breed your band! It was a nice opportunity that sprung up because they were available and keen. And we are aware that we can play together really well.”</p><p>With Sharon also in the core group that made the record, does this mean that the Good Time Finn Family Band and Medicine Show is on the horizon?</p><p>“We haven’t done a lot together, and I would be wary of assuming that my view of what would be great would be the same as that of the boys,” he carefully replies, “but I think we’re working towards a meaningful collaboration at some point, where everyone’s writing as well.”</p><p>It would seem that working with one’s kids clearly has some advantages (“we know we can get through any small family moments, any old sensitivities that crop up …”), but it raises some unique questions too. For example, how does one sit down with your sons and have them run through a song about their father’s eventual death, as with the new album’s In My Blood?</p><p>Finn’s momentarily taken aback. “It’s not actually that dark, that song. There’s a heavy subtext but what I’m trying to say in that is that there are certain times when you feel something and unmistakable, and my theory is that you inherit memories from your ancestors: memories of feelings, pure feelings.”</p><p>Via the culture? </p><p>“No no, in the DNA. Essentially I was thinking that if you have a really intense experience, you pass that on to your children and it’s responsible for certain ways that they respond to certain things, little mysterious elements of character. But what the boys think of it, I don’t know.”</p><p>Have there been moments when the subject matter is too raw, though? </p><p>“Actually, there was a moment on the last record, and it was a slightly distressing moment for me, where I realised I’d really laid myself open. The first track, Tell Me What You Want. To me it seemed to be a very playful, mischievous spin on saying ‘c’mon baby, this is what I like’ and your baby saying ‘yeah, tell me what you want’,” he sighs. </p><p>“But because we’re a little older and have kids, people thought it was quite creepy. My nephew asked me about it one day – ‘eww, that was a bit saucy, isn’t it, that one?’ – and I just went ‘<i>aww’</i>. People do pore over things a little more than I may be comfortable with admitting.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ34SrL1aaM\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZ34SrL1aaM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>He admits that he still finds the lyrics the most challenging thing (“There’s still a part of me that thinking I’m just getting by”), especially given those writers he particularly admires. “The guy from Arctic Monkeys [Alex Turner] is clearly a really good lyricist, of a style. He’s a very clever writer.</p><p>“I actually think in places Lorde is a very impressive with her language. I hope she has something to write about now that her life’s been transformed to massive celebrity, because she certainly wrote about being a teenager quite well. And there are great lyrics in the rap world: there’s some great wordsmithery, albeit talking about things that I don’t necessarily relate to.”</p><p>He confesses that he doesn’t always recognise every pop culture reference in rap music, although<i> </i>Dizzy Heights has a surprising amount of them. Among the reflections in the album's most Crowded House-sounding moment, Recluse, are references to Howard Hughes, Sly Stone and Game of Thrones. </p><p>“I threw a few references that were rolling around the house when I was writing the album. My wife got really into<i> </i>Game of Thrones<i> </i>for a while – I never got to watch it.” </p><p>Well, with the upcoming tour schedule, maybe it’s worth downloading for the flights. </p><p>“To be honest, I don’t have much endurance with those series, even if they’re good,\" he says. \"I didn’t even get to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/30/breaking-bad-series-finale-tv-review\">the end of<i> </i>Breaking Bad</a>.\"</p>","headline":"Neil Finn: 'Lorde should leave New Zealand'","trailText":"As he releases his first solo album for 13 years, the songwriter talks to <b>Andrew P Street</b> about the forthcoming Crowded House album, his admiration for Alex Turner, and why his family dislike his 'sexy' lyrics <br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mf37","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391658251035/99c4ac1e-0ac7-424a-a834-d1dcfd21ffac-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391658251035/99c4ac1e-0ac7-424a-a834-d1dcfd21ffac-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1473","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"428941131","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f1d7b4e4b001cf7b2eeba3","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Andrew P Street","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038372","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-13T03:53:26Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/06/neil-finn-lorde-should-leave-new-zealand","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/06/neil-finn-lorde-should-leave-new-zealand","tags":[{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog","webTitle":"Australia culture blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","references":[]},{"id":"music/lorde","webTitle":"Lorde","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/lorde","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/music/lorde","references":[]},{"id":"world/newzealand","webTitle":"New Zealand","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/newzealand","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrew-p-street","webTitle":"Andrew P Street","r2ContributorId":"56956","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew P Street is an Adelaide-built, Sydney-based journalist.

Since its first iteration’s final episode in November of 2011, the ABC has struggled to find anything as successful to plug into its Wednesday night ABC1 comedy lineup. Given that the show first ended because the hosts were simply ready for new things, there’s <a href=\"http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/37779/Spicks-and-Specks-confirms-new-hosts-for-2014\">an air of earnest hope surrounding this newly-minted version</a> that the public will laugh and sing along like nothing ever changed.</p><p>Taking on the chair that turned <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/comedian-adam-hills-wont-be-hosting-adam-hills-tonight-in-2014/story-e6frfmyi-1226769786417\">Adam Hills</a> into a household name, comedian <a href=\"http://www.joshearl.com.au/\">Josh Earl</a> immediately lends the show a somewhat more manic energy than Hills’ everyman charm. His bouncy, rapid-fire delivery makes the show feel like a liquor-fuelled dinner party, right down to a few overheated jokes.</p><p>Taking over team captain duties from <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/lunch-with--alan-brough-20120112-1pvvz.html\">Alan Brough</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/05/myf-warhurst-im-not-15-any-more-but-i-still-sobbed-over-a-song\">Myf Warhurst</a> are Killing Heidi frontwoman-turned-solo artist <a href=\"http://www.au.timeout.com/melbourne/timein/features/3351/spicks-and-specks-ella-hooper\">Ella Hooper</a>, and comedian and radio personality <a href=\"http://adamrichard.com/\">Adam Richard</a>. Both were regulars on the old format, and adequately fill the shoes of their predecessors. That said, it’s difficult to think that either Warhurst or Richard would ever fail to recognise <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Y11hwjMNs\">Nina Simone</a>.</p><p>Joining as guests are mezzo-soprano opera singer <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/two-of-us-20130617-2ocza.html\">Jacqui Dark</a>, who is as close as there might be to a ray of sunshine; Tame Impala frontman <a href=\"http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/4440214\">Jay Watson</a>, whose stoner deadpan slices nicely through the glee; Irish comedian <a href=\"http://desbishop.net/\">Des Bishop</a>, who doesn’t get much to do; and panel show perennial <a href=\"http://www.meshellaurie.com/\">Meshel Laurie</a>, as hilarious as ever.</p><p>But while some faces have changed, little else has. The set’s gotten a makeover with a red curtain backdrop, perhaps abandoned on the stage after the end of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/randling/\">Randling</a>, replacing the jewels and chandeliers of old. The host and team tables have been gussied up with some added colour. It’s kind of modernised without being more modern at all, like the same old doll re-released with a new hat.</p><p>The format is essentially unchanged, too; the only new game so far is Do You See What I See?, which is just song titles spelled out in pictures. Old greats like Substitute and Look What They’ve Done … (To My Song Ma!) return, and the episode still ends with The Final Countdown. </p><p>Will audiences stick with Spicks and Specks 2.0? Well, there isn’t much of a reason not to, which might be a problem. Everything’s so samey that people might be more inclined to shrug at it than to pop it on every Wednesday night, though there’s hardly much competition for something this effortlessly fun on other networks. But if it’s not really broken, why fix it?</p><p>Also well-loved and returning to ABC1 on Wednesday night was <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/moodys/\">The Moodys</a>, the follow-up to the successful 2012 series <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/amoodychristmas/\">A Moody Christmas</a>. Where the first centred on consecutive Christmas Days, this time around we’re in for a year of Moody gatherings. Of course, the first of the year is Australia Day coming amidst a time of upheaval for the family.</p><p>As is custom with Australian sitcoms these days, The Moodys emphasises the situational over the comedy. More gently amusing than laugh-out-loud funny, it nonetheless continues to nail the family's supreme dysfunction. Dan (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Meadows\">Ian Meadows</a>) is now settled into a relationship with Cora (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0361894/\">Jane Harber</a>), while Dan’s brother Sean (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1669772/\">Patrick Brammall</a>) languishes in the family home now sold by parents Maree (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123346/\">Tina Bursill</a>) and Kevin (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0011595/\">Danny Adcock</a>).</p><p>The day, though, truly begins with Uncle Terry’s (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0319696/\">Darren Gilshenan</a>) claim on prime beachfront barbecue real estate. With Cora’s conservative parents in tow, a shirtless Hayden (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1772599/\">Guy Edmonds</a>) showing up to drive a wedge between Dan and Cora, and Roger (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0972716/\">Phil Lloyd</a>) showing up to Bridget (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330531/\">Rachel Gordon</a>)'s chagrin, the day seems doomed.</p><p>But remarkably it remains fairly sane. An Indigenous family shows up with a claim to Uncle Terry’s spot, and after an amusing if flippant battle over parkland rights, they agree to share the space. Sean, meanwhile, lamely wears an Australian flag as a cape while Dan continues to fumble awkwardly for the approval of Cora’s father.</p><p>Lloyd and his co-writer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2094436/\">Trent O’Donnell</a> keep things fairly low-key, spending time teasing out relationships and establishing backstory for newcomers until drama strikes. But it’s a solid first entry in what is sure to be an enjoyable catalogue of The Moodys’ terrible gatherings. With Easter, birthdays, and a wedding in the family’s future, this is surely just the tip of a crazy iceberg.</p>","headline":"Spicks and Specks and The Moodys – TV review","trailText":"Two old favourites returned to Australian TV last night in rebooted new versions – but both chose cosy familiarity over surprises, writes <b>Laurence Barber</b>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgv8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391648339062/af6c9a8d-de69-4eff-b365-912c462581d3-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391648339062/af6c9a8d-de69-4eff-b365-912c462581d3-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"713","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429021016","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2d0ebe4b0530e249db01f","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Laurence Barber","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039021","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:00:20+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/06/spicks-and-specks-the-moodys-tv-review","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/06/spicks-and-specks-the-moodys-tv-review","tags":[{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog","webTitle":"Australia culture blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/comedy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/laurence-barber","webTitle":"Laurence Barber","r2ContributorId":"58925","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Laurence Barber is a television and film critic and freelance writer based in Brisbane.

How's your health these days?<strong><a href=\"#1\">(1</a><a name=\"1back\">)</a></strong> </strong><br />At the moment I'm tip-top. Music always gave me hope. The record I play the most is John Coltrane's Giant Steps. It's exciting and wonderful. It takes my mind off bad stuff and I get engrossed in the moment.</p><p><strong>At Chic gigs, you don't just play Chic music, you also play the hits you produced for other artists.</strong><br />I play Chic Organization songs: Sister Sledge and Diana Ross, David Bowie and INXS, Duran Duran and Madonna and Grace Jones. That Bowie album<strong><a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a></strong> to me was almost as much mine as his; it was a breakthrough moment in my life. For him to work with the guy being targeted by the Disco Sucks campaign<strong><a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a></strong> … can you imagine the pressure he was under?</p><p><strong>What do you remember about Disco Sucks?</strong><br />Well, it happened and then we had one of the biggest records of our career with Diana Ross! [1980's Diana]. But by that time Chic was toxic. Even my friends were bad-mouthing us. It was really not a nice period. What was weird was that people were pitting us against the Knack<strong><a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong>and the Knack were really great guys - they did their second album in the studio next door to us. But they only had one hit with My Sharona. One year to the day [after Good Times reached the top], the number one hit was Another One Bites the Dust by Queen and it sounded not like My Sharona but like Good Times! It was clearly an homage, not to mention that [Queen bassist] John Deacon was with me in the studio when I wrote the damn thing! But then, as Verdi said<strong><a href=\"#5\">(5</a><a name=\"5back\">)</a></strong>, \"Good composers borrow, great composers steal.\"</p><p><strong>Is it true you turned down working with Aretha Franklin?</strong><br />We had a meeting. Her version of the story is, she was much more sophisticated than we were. We just didn't want to be the ones who made Aretha go disco. There was no real fight. But once we didn't agree to do it her way, there was never going to be a second meeting.</p><p><strong>What are your memories of disco's golden age?</strong><br />I'd go to clubs in the midwest and they'd be the same as Studio 54, with people having sex in the bathroom and doing drugs, even though it was Tulsa, Oklahoma. They were all trying to emulate New York, London and Paris.</p><p><strong>Did you have sex in a bathroom?</strong><br />It happened all the time. I never counted how often. I don't want to sound egotistical because it was just the culture. You almost expected it to happen.</p><p><strong>Did you join the Mile High Club?</strong><br />Quite often it would happen right there at your seat. That's how it was in those days. If it was with an air stewardess, the other girls would keep a look out because they didn't want the captain or flight crew to catch them.</p><p><strong>Chic were incredibly prolific<strong><a href=\"#6\">(6</a><a name=\"6back\">)</a></strong>. Did you get your energy from drugs?</strong><br />We didn't get that high in the studio until after we became famous. That's when the drugs really kicked in. We certainly didn't do any drugs around Diana Ross, but we did a little around Johnny Mathis<strong><a href=\"#7\">(7</a><a name=\"7back\">)</a></strong>. At that point we were getting a little full of ourselves.</p><p><strong>Who have you most relied on for inspiration over the years?</strong><br />Bernard Edwards<strong><a href=\"#8\">(8</a><a name=\"8back\">)</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Did it come easy to you both?</strong><br />Almost every single song we put out it was a struggle and a fight. Le Freak, our biggest single, we played that record for the record company and every one of them tried to talk us into changing it or releasing something else. And that's the only triple-platinum single in the history of Atlantic Records! They couldn't hear it, and the reason was, they couldn't compare it to anything else going on.</p><p><strong>What was it like working with Daft Punk?</strong><br />Like love at first sight. Just like Bowie, they let me do what I do. They loved it. \"Go ahead, Nile, do your thing, man.\" When we found that groove I felt like Indiana Jones – like, \"Wow, I just discovered the Ark of the Covenant!\"</p><p><strong>Is Pharrell Williams the latterday you?</strong><br />I can't make superlative statements when it comes to music. But when I met him at the Grammys for the first time, after <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSVHoHyErBQ\" title=\"\">Justin Timberlake's Rock Your Body</a> which was based on Chic's Good Times, he knew that I knew. And he bowed down and said, \"Hey, man, thank you.\"</p><p><strong>Good Times has proven quite influential, all told <strong><a href=\"#9\">(9</a><a name=\"9back\">)</a></strong>.</strong><br />It was funny the way we discovered that walking bassline - it was a total accident. Bernard started playing something and I screamed: \"Walk!\" And he did and that was Good Times.</p><p><strong>Was your guitar part for Get Lucky a similar moment of accidental inspiration?</strong><br />Talk about Chic 2.0! I recorded it at the same studio – Electric Lady – where we made the first Chic record, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOx81aG-EN4\" title=\"\">Everybody Dance</a>. I plugged directly into the board and it was that Nile Rodgers/Chic sound. It's what I call \"the Bryan Ferry look\" <strong><a href=\"#10\">(10</a><a name=\"10back\">)</a></strong> – that look musicians get when I play with them. Heads start bobbing and they get a smile that's ear to ear and I'm like, \"I got the groove now.\" Boom – there's the Bryan Ferry look.</p><p><strong>Do musicians say embarrassingly fawning things to you?</strong><br />Well, I call David Bowie the Picasso of rock'n'roll, because that's how I think of him, so I always embarrass him when I see him, by saying that.</p><p><strong>Your music provided the hedonist's soundtrack while also being very melancholy.</strong><br />Absolutely. It was funk but it wasn't <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJvjWh2Vhu4\" title=\"\">Parliament</a>. It was based on European modal melodies. It was sophisto-funk.</p><p><strong>Chic were always quintessentially disco and yet an anomaly.</strong><br />We're the contradiction even though people say we're the rule now. We were always trying to work around what's trendy. If there's something trendy going on, we don't do that. In fact, we go out of our way not to do that.</p><p><strong>You've always had the best of both worlds: lots of acclaim but with the cool anonymity of the songwriter/producer. Is Chic more of a brand than a band? </strong><br />It's funny, there's this coffee shop near where I live and recently I ran into these hip, young kids who are really into what's happening now. So I asked them, \"Can you sing a song by Chic?\" And they'd never heard of Chic. Then I asked, \"Have you heard this?\" And I went, \"Aaah - freak out!\" And they sang the whole song. Then I sang, \"We are family – I've got all my sisters with me.\" And they look at me like I'm crazy: \"Of course we know that song, everybody knows that song!\" And I go, \"Well, I wrote that.\" And they're, like, \"Come on! Get out of here!\"</p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p><a name=\"1\">(1)</a> Rodgers was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010.

There are few things more annoying on TV than smug, young(ish) professionals trying to build their dream house and complaining about having to comply with things like planning permission.

For some people a connection with the longest continuing culture in the world, whilst enticing, seems all too difficult and unnecessarily complicated. For others, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures seem distant and remote, as if viewing them through the wrong end of magnifying lens.<br></p><p>The Melbourne Indigenous Arts festival, which begins on 5 February, is set to wrap its arms around the city and bring Indigenous cultures up close and personal for 12 days. More than 40 artists will gather to make the rich diversity of the longest continuing culture in the world more accessible than ever before.</p><p>Culture is knowledge, and knowledge is survival. For us the visual and performing arts have always been the way we know the world and give meaning to everything in it. For more than 1000 generations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have passed on all knowledge of geography, the sciences, medicine and humanity through the visual and performing arts. No fear of a hard-drive meltdown in traditional culture. As long as you knew the song or the dance or the story, culture would survive.</p><p>Across the festival you’ll find a strong theme of both the personal and collective narrative. Knowing who we are and where we come from is fundamental to the human condition. Even though fulfilling this need has become far more difficult for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people since 1788, a glance at the festival program confirms a tale of resilience with more than 25 nations from across our vast continent. Along with a strong presence from Victoria you will see artists from various nations from around Australia including; Yorta Yorta, Kamilaroi, Muruwari (NSW), Kala Lagaw Ya, Kulkalgal (TS), Gunai Kurnai, Wamba Wamba, Bangarang, Banjalung (NSW), Kaytej (NT), Gunditjmara, Biripi (NSW), Dunghutti (NSW), Kokkatha (SA), Ynugu, Lavitja, Majuta (NT), Kuku Yalanji (Qld), Bundjalung, Mirning (SA), Muthi Muthi, Wemba Wemba, Ngarrindjeri (SA), Arrente (NT), Gamilaroi (NSW), and Pitjantatjara (Central Australia).</p><p>I could list so many highlights in this richly diverse line-up –<a href=\"http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/Whatson/MIAF/Documents/MIAF-Program-2014.pdf\"> you can read the whole programme here</a>. The Ghost Net Weavers (Birrarung Marr lower terrace Saturday 8 February and Sunday 9 February) would be a personal favourite, but who could resist the charm of world famous gum-leaf virtuoso Uncle Herb Patten or Wamba Wamba storyman Ron Murray (ArtPlay Birrarung Marr, 8 February and 9 February, 10am and 12pm). This event is billed for children aged five to 12 but like me, I’m sure you will want to stay as they weave their magic through story and song.</p><p>Koorioboree (8 February and 9 February, Earth Stage, Birrarung Marr), is an event guaranteed to lift the spirit and, like so many events at this festival, admission is free. This great gathering of south-eastern clans will celebrate our connection to country through traditional song, dance and ceremony. Not to be missed!</p><p>The appetite for a deeper knowledge of Australia’s Indigenous cultures is growing all the time in Australia and that makes a festival of this kind significant to everyone. Come and witness first-hand an ancient culture that has always been contemporary to its time, informed and shaped by the knowledge of 1000 generations. As the people of the Kulin nations would say: wominjeka – you are welcome.</p><p>•<a href=\"http://www.melbournerecital.com.au/events/2014/deborahcheetham/\"> Deborah Cheetham’s Til the Black Lady

This is less serious than it sounds. Most were everyday sales from private collections here to private collections elsewhere. Welcome to the art market. The small number that were of high potential importance to UK museums were properly identified by the export review system.</p><p>Of these, only six of the original 19 were successfully acquired for public ownership. But it is the sharp decline in public funding for the arts, rather than the export controls themselves, that lies squarely behind this failure. The works which the culture minister, Ed Vaizey, challenged curators to fundraise for in 2013 were, at £115m, worth 50% more than those he export-stopped in 2012; meanwhile his government oversaw funding cuts averaging more than 20% across the sector. With such a background it was remarkable that as many as six were saved.</p><p>Agencies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Art Fund continue to do all they can to guard the UK's arts and heritage against the ravages of the government's austerity programme. In the case of the National Portrait Gallery's current campaign for Van Dyck's self-portrait, a number of trusts and foundations, as well as significant sums from public donations, are also of crucial help. The combination of high art prices in a buoyant international market, currently fast-fuelled by hungry private investors, and a sorry parallel decline in national and local funding for UK museums, is the only enemy.<br /><strong>Stephen Deuchar </strong><br /><em>Director, </em><a href=\"http://www.artfund.org\" title=\"\"><em>Art Fund</em></a></p>","headline":"Budget cuts easing the export of art","trailText":"<p><strong>Letters:</strong> It is the sharp decline in public funding for the arts, rather than the export controls themselves, that lies squarely behind this failure</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"31","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mez2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391543566277/Sir-Anthony-Van-Dyck-port-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391543566277/Sir-Anthony-Van-Dyck-port-004.jpg","wordcount":"269","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"428912785","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8644937","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038205","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-07T21:00:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/04/budget-cuts-easing-export-of-art","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2014/feb/04/budget-cuts-easing-export-of-art","tags":[{"id":"culture/arts-funding","webTitle":"Arts funding","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/arts-funding","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/arts-funding","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","webTitle":"Editorials & reply","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"tone/letters","webTitle":"Letters","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/letters","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428919589","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391543560442/Sir-Anthony-Van-Dyck-port-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"National Portrait Gallery","altText":"Sir Anthony Van Dyck portrait","height":"54","credit":"National Portrait Gallery/PA","caption":"The National Portrait Gallery has joined the Art Fund to raise the £12.5 million needed to save the last self-portrait of Anthony Van Dyck.

I thought it was the most amazing piece of acting. The other was seeing my sister Sorcha <strong>(1)</strong> in Brian Friel's version of Three Sisters when I was 23. I'd trained as a musician, but I saw that and thought: \"Well, now I know how to play Irina <strong>(2)</strong>.\" A few years later, I did.</p><p></p><p><strong>Most of your family is involved in showbusiness. Do you think the desire to act really can run in the blood?</strong></p><p>I don't know whether there's a gene, but you can certainly inherit an ease with the whole nature of life in theatre – a life which is constantly changing, and requires a desire for adventure and playfulness. I&nbsp;tried hard not go into acting, but when I finally got on stage, it felt like the most natural place for me.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you suffer for your art?</strong></p><p>I deal with nerves, and I'm an insomniac while I'm working on a play. But I&nbsp;get much more from it than I sacrifice. I've had the opportunity to live so many different lives: to play characters who are cleverer, more articulate and more epic than I am. That's a bit of a luxury.</p><p></p><p><strong>Which of your roles has been most challenging?</strong></p><p>Siobhan in Curious Incident <strong>(3)</strong>: there was a lot to it. But I&nbsp;find every role a challenge. The best bit, really, is getting a part. Then, as soon as you start working on it, you see&nbsp;all the things that are difficult.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the greatest threat to theatre today?</strong></p><p>That not enough young people will be introduced to it. Ticket prices are so high: a lot of theatres are addressing that, but I do worry that it means young people aren't being put in touch with the experience of live theatre.</p><p></p><p><strong>What advice would you give to a&nbsp;young actor?</strong></p><p>Watch as many plays as you can and say&nbsp;yes to work. Worrying about the direction you want to go in is a bit of a&nbsp;fantasy. The universe will give you opportunities. Generally, it's better to say: \"I'm going to go with this.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Is there an art form you don't relate to?</strong></p><p>I'm not great on very, very modern art. The cube in an empty room doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?</strong></p><p>I find interviews that describe me as \"very nice\" quite hard to take. It sounds like damning with faint praise.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>What work of art would you most like to own?</strong></p><p>A painting by Jack B Yeats <strong>(4)</strong>: either a&nbsp;muddy grey picture of Connemara, or&nbsp;The Liffey Swim, because it reminds me of Dublin.</p><p></p><p><strong>Complete this sentence: At heart, I'm just a frustrated …</strong></p><p>Tap-dancer.</p><p></p><p><strong>What would work as the soundtrack to your life?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dpMMeetFIk\" title=\"\">A Brahms clarinet quintet</a>. They're so full of passion and highs and lows.</p><p></p><p><strong>How would you like to be remembered?</strong></p><p>Decent wife <strong>(5)</strong>, decent mum, decent&nbsp;friend.</p><h2>In short</h2><p><strong>Born: </strong>Dublin, 1959</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> Best known for long stint in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101114\" title=\"\">the TV series Heartbeat</a>. Has also worked extensively at the RSC and the National, starring in Romeo and Juliet and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.</p><p><strong>Low point:</strong> \"Doing a play called The Tutor at the Old Vic a long time ago. I was floundering.\"</p><p><strong>High point:</strong> \"Doing Three Sisters with my sisters, father and husband.\"</p><p></p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p><strong>(1) </strong>Cusack was born into what is commonly referred to as a \"theatrical dynasty\".

Some of the actors were disturbed about the volume of carnage in Shakespeare's original script, and voted to give Hamlet a happy ending, complete with a dance routine. But Lawrie (Claudius) stood firm. He was the only one who'd seen Hamlet performed before and felt that it just wouldn't have the required impact without plenty of actual tragedy. But a compromise was quickly proposed: they'd do the dance routine in the middle, and everyone could still die at the end. \"Best idea ever!\" agreed Lawrie. It's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03sc49m/Growing_Up_Downs/\">worth catching on the iPlayer</a>.</p>I couldn't quite face the Gaddafi doc, but likely Lucy Mangan is made of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/04/storyville-mad-dog-gaddafis-secret-world-tv-review\">sterner stuff</a>.<br> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52f0b78be4b0ac5d82bb961d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-04T10:03:02.323Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Last night's telly</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>I for one haven't had quite enough recently of people with loud voices shouting loudly about benefits. So last night I tuned excitedly into The Big Benefits Row on Channel 5. Not Debate, not Discussion, but Row. Because that's exactly what it was: all your favourite rent-a-gobs – Edwina Currie, Owen Jones, Rachel Johnson, Terry Christian – shouting loudly about benefits, as goaded by Matthew Wright. It's worth a gander <a href=\"http://www.channel5.com/shows/the-big-benefits-row-live/episodes/the-big-benefits-row-live\">here</a>, if only for the self-parodic, Cassetteboy-style intro which culminated in a maddening supercut of people saying the word \"benefits\". Benefits, benefits, benefits. But you probably won't make it further than the words, \"what you you think, Katie Hopkins?\"</p><p>Interesting to see that The Mirror deemed The Big Benefits Row worthy of a (weary and cynical) <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/big-benefits-row-live-channel-3108957#.UvC5Xhk2Te4\">liveblog</a>.

The three unperformed plays explore those alternative choices.</p><p>Japes tells the story, over 27 years, of two brothers, Michael and Jason (Japes), and what happens when they fall in love with the same woman.</p><p>Gray began writing Japes Too at rehearsals, from the stalls of the Haymarket theatre. Later, concerned that he had only told one side of the story, he wrote a third version, called Michael, and shortly before his death he wrote a fourth, called Missing Dates.</p><p>Gray was the author of nearly 40 plays, including many West End hits such as Butley and Quartermaine's Terms, five novels and a witheringly funny series of memoirs collectively known as The Smoking Diaries.</p><p>Japes was clearly an important play for him. He wrote in 2001: \"The feeling this time, which I've certainly never had before, is that this is it, this is the last, there isn't another one in me, never will be.\"</p><p>One reason it was so close to Gray's heart was because the brothers' relationship was modelled on his own relationship with his younger brother Piers, who died as a result of his alcoholism aged 49. The death of his sibling helped prompt Gray into forsaking alcohol a year later.</p><p>\"I think it was a deeply personal investigation of his life and past,\" said Edward Hall, artistic director of Hampstead theatre, which will stage the four plays over nine weeks, between 20 March and 17 May in the downstairs 90-seat studio space. \"Not only is it fascinating drama but it also tells you an enormous amount about Gray.\"</p><p>While Japes Too is fairly close to Japes, the following plays veer off in more dramatic directions and introduce new characters.</p><p>Hall said he hoped many people would watch the whole series. \"If you like Simon Gray, or you're half interested, seeing all four will be a fantastic experience. They're almost like a sophisticated and intense soap opera where you can see different perspectives of the same story.\"</p><p>Japes was first directed in 2001 by Hall's father Peter Hall, and starred Toby Stephens and Jasper Britton as Japes and Michael. It opened to generally fantastic reviews: the Daily Telegraph called it a masterpiece while the Guardian's Michael Billington called it \"emotionally conservative but fitfully enjoyable\".</p><p>Hall said it will be a tricky and challenging project. \"It is really complicated. The scheduling is complicated and trying to make financial sense is complicated.\"</p><p>Tamara Harvey will direct the quartet, called In the Vale of Health, with casting to be announced. Hall said they would transfer the plays to the main space \"if the actors are still sane\".</p>","headline":"Three unseen Simon Gray plays to be performed with revival of Japes","trailText":"Hampstead theatre to stage Gray's hit with three unperformed plays exploring different outcomes for Japes characters","newspaperPageNumber":"13","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3meka","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391531263602/Three-unseen-Simon-Gray-p-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391531263602/Three-unseen-Simon-Gray-p-006.jpg","wordcount":"483","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428901764","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8643930","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Brown, arts correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038105","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-07T16:36:15Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/04/simon-gray-unseen-plays-japes-hampstead-theatre","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2014/feb/04/simon-gray-unseen-plays-japes-hampstead-theatre","tags":[{"id":"culture/simongray","webTitle":"Simon Gray","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/simongray","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/simongray","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"stage/westend","webTitle":"West End","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/westend","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/stage/westend","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markbrown","webTitle":"Mark Brown","rcsId":"GNL508770","r2ContributorId":"16054","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/mark_brown_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Mark Brown is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture\">arts</a> correspondent.

You can almost taste the energy and grime and dirt and outsider status of the bands in its grooves. </p><p>The second half is … let’s just say that it’s probably a fair representation.</p><p>On the upside we have:</p><ul><li>The era-defining teen anthem of alienation and despair, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQdA3M1tag4\">My Pal</a></li><li>The Meanies’ 90% weird and 10% irritating pop/rock dust-up <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAYMJB5uA7s\">10% Weird</a></li><li>The appropriately-named <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR5DykkpnE\">Beasts Of Bourbon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJfTF8uTJMQ\">Screamfeeder</a>, drowsy and feminine and possessed of a mid-90s Massachusetts (Dinosaur Jr, Breeders) bent</li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqKlwSyhPw\">The talismanic Magic Dirt</a> – a very rare female presence among all this boy/boy sweat and angst – with their buzzsaw pop so redolent of Juliana Hatfield’s Blake Babies </li></ul> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqKlwSyhPw\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYqKlwSyhPw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>But then the conservatives in the Australian music industry began to get a fix on events. Major labels started inventing their own \"independent\" labels. The \"sound\" and \"attitude\" became codified, locked down. (Grunge was actually a confluence of two distinct musical style and attitude: punk and suburban metal, as typified by the two main Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam – the mainstream has always naturally favoured the latter because that’s where record sales lie.) So while America had Sonic Youth and Pavement and the Breeders, it also had its Bush and Spin Doctors and Smashing Pumpkins.</p><p>In Australia, there were bands like:</p><ul><li>Frenzal Rhomb, and their tribute to Green Day, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXyplMT2dWI\">Never Had So Much Fun</a></li><li>Fucking Powderfinger and their generic sports stadium-filler rock – a Cold Chisel for the new generation). (Or is that Melbourne’s Powder Monkeys? I never can get the two bands separate in my mind.)</li><li>Gerling and their <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kqa8-Bg-fQ\">spirited rendition of Pavement</a></li><li>Something For Kate’s truly horrible <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srjbfOwd1Jk\">Monsters</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_-q-KodhAI\">The Living End</a> – who have CLEARLY heard the Clash at some point – and Jebediah and Grinspoon, and all the rest of the independent/corporate rock crossover. The Vines, meanwhile, are a prime example of why people think Melbourne bands rock harder than Sydney bands. The Vines cannot rock, no matter <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asOvnGHwtDU\">how many Nirvana songs they rip off</a> <br></li></ul> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kqa8-Bg-fQ\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kqa8-Bg-fQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>And then there’s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHwuOtcALQ\">Silverchair</a>.</p><p>Yeah, Silverchair. Not since Savage Garden has a band caused Australia to be so ridiculed the world over. In the UK, they were considered the Aussie version of Stone Temple Plagiarists – grunge-lite, suburban metal by any other name.</p><p>In Australia, they were given awards.</p><p>The second half of this compilation is like stepping into a horrendous time-warp where cock rock still holds sway and females are regarded as second-class citizens. Big shout-outs to the two or three females that feature among the 100 or so male musicians here. It might have been nice to include the unsettling kiddie-pop of <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/song-of-the-day-2/song-of-the-day-442-clag-something-wonderful-from-the-90s/\">Brisbane’s Clag</a>, or the John Peel-beloved Even as we Speak, or the Hummingbirds, or Melbourne’s perpetually overlooked but highly influential <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gdwkLWMG-I\">Cannanes</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N54Y01MNH1Y\">Falling Joys</a>, or the <a href=\"http://killrockstars.bandcamp.com/album/kitty-finger\">wonderful Riot Grrrl-influenced Matrimony</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-gl3Ma3wew\">the Clouds</a>, to show a little gender awareness, but perhaps it really wasn’t appropriate. Or perhaps the compilers have taken \"alternative rock\" to mean \"male-led rock\", a common enough mistake.</p><p>And sure, we could argue about the omissions – Ratcat, Custard, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYifV6mb84\">Smudge</a> and Cosmic Psychos seem to be the big four, alongside names like the Mavis’s, Pollyanna and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFmOLUroKVI\">the almighty Venom P Stinger</a>… early Dirty 3 even. But there’s a second part already in the works, and Jeez.</p><p>Ain’t Australia already got enough dirty male testosterone out there? <br></p><ul><li><p>This article was amended on 5 February 2014.

As you might expect from the passing of such a great actor, there's been a lot of thoughtful writing on the man, his talents and his career.<br></p><p> The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, tries to capture the essence of Seymour Hoffman's screen presence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/02/philip-seymour-hoffman-dies\">by discussing his role in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> Anderson's direction brought out, in spades, all the qualities which made Hoffman such a formidable and at times even threatening presence: he looked like someone who would debate, seduce, or get in a physical fight at the drop of a hat. Maybe with the same person. And he often gave the impression of suppressing some deep well of anger, damming it and re-directing it into sexiness and charm.</p></blockquote><p> Alexis Soloski, writing about his stage roles, notes Seymour Hoffman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman-stage-actor-plays\">attraction towards characters that, on the surface, were unsympathetic</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> Despite a rumpled charisma, he made a specialty of difficult, unappealing characters to whom he imparted a sense of ravenous need – for love, for esteem, for release, or as in the case of Shepard's brothers, for toast. </p></blockquote><p> Variety's Justin Chang, draws a parallel between the unlovely characters and the fact the Seymour Hoffman <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/varietys-justin-chang-remembers-philip-seymour-hoffman-a-master-of-his-screen-craft-1201083336/\">did not look like a typical Hollywood star</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> Watching him then [in Todd Solondz's Happiness]  — with his ruddy complexion, stocky build and a wild blond mass of hair that made vanity impossible — it was hard not to recoil from the sheer unloveliness of the actor’s appearance. The fascination of Hoffman’s early screen performances is that he didn’t seem especially interested in deflecting what is often politely referred to as an actor’s lack of “conventional good looks.” On the contrary, he seemed bent on magnifying it, burrowing ever deeper and darker, as though exploring the outer reaches of his own limitless capacity to repel. It felt nothing if not personal, and Hoffman himself acknowledged this unflattering impulse in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/28/philip-seymour-hoffman-jack-goes-boating\">2011 interview</a> with the Guardian, in which he noted, “I had insecurities and fears like everybody does, and I got over it. But I was interested in the parts of me that struggled with those things.”</p></blockquote><p> The author of that Guardian interview,. Simon Hattenstone, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/02/philip-seymour-hoffman-death-interview?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">elucidates this point further</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> He didn't say a word more than necessary and often said less. But there was a profound honesty to him. He might have insisted he was giving me nothing of himself, but when I transcribed our meeting I realised it was just like one of his movies – he'd reluctantly grouched his way to a full and complex self-portrait.</p></blockquote><p> Finally, Richard Brody, writing in the New Yorker, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2014/02/philip-seymour-hoffmans-genius.html\">makes the link between the towering performances and a more complicated personality</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Work that’s only good is limited to its technique; when it’s great, a work is virtually inseparable from the artist’s life because it gives the sense of being the product of a whole life and being the absolute and total focus of that life at the time of its creation. </p><p>Plenty of great artists plumb the soul’s depths without recourse to drugs or alcohol, but it’s naïve to discount the connection between artistic ecstasies, self-surpassing exertions, uncommonly powerful desires, and altered states of consciousness.</p></blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T10:41:28.065Z\">at 10.41am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52ef65c6e4b0e2b516f9e9ad\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T09:48:50.507Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Jason Alexander's face is freaking me out</p><p>V</p><p>V</p><p>V</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52ef625fe4b0e2b516f9e9ab\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T09:39:42.193Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">George Costanza knows the meaning of the mumble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhmpTxLhqzU\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhmpTxLhqzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>Last night, during some sporting event or another, America premiered ALL its adverts.

There are certainly big differences between modern fencing and the fighting we see on screen: the musketeers' duels are conducted in large, swashbuckling swipes for maximum entertainment value – unlike the light, quick moves used in the sport.</p><p>But there are some similarities. At the most basic level, fencing boils down to two areas: footwork and managing your weapon. We get good demonstrations of both in these fights. D'Artagnan  is light on his feet and excellent at changing direction. He gets the gold medal from me.</p><p>Fencing today uses three different weapons: foil, épée and sabre. All&nbsp;three have their roots, like the sport itself, in the art of duelling and the swordfighting tradition of medieval Europe. When the musketeers fight on their feet, they use techniques that are close to the foil and épée styles – keeping their opponent at a distance with the blade. On horseback, they're closer to the slashing sabre style: that's no surprise, as the sabre in fencing grew out of cavalry fighting.</p><p>Fencing, of course, is not a fight to the death – but then in reality, neither was duelling. A gentleman would usually only draw blood and, in so doing, prove a point of honour. We don't draw blood in fencing, but the point system reflects this tradition: when a fencer is hit, the weapon retracts, and a score is recorded electronically.</p><p>Historically, swordsmanship was very much a male preserve, but the number of men and women in modern fencing is roughly equal. I hope this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/20/the-musketeers-tv-review\" title=\"\">very enjoyable programme</a> will draw many more people to the sport. After all, we saw a massive spike in interest in fencing after the Madonna scenes in the Bond&nbsp;film Die Another Day.</p><p><em>Karim Bashir works for <a href=\"http://britishfencing.com/\" title=\"\">British Fencing</a>.<br />The Musketeers is on BBC1 on Sundays</em></p><p>Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIF8qouivIU\">Watch the fencing scene from Die Another Day here</a></p>","headline":"A fencing champion on BBC swashbuckler The Musketeers","trailText":"<p>Fleet of foot and sharp with his weapon, D'Artagnan takes the gold medal for his TV sabre-rattling, writes fencing champion <strong>Karim Bashir</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"19","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mc54","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391185146726/The-Musketeers-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391185146726/The-Musketeers-006.jpg","wordcount":"327","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428609965","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8614939","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Interview by Laura Barnett","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2036236","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-28T16:09:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/03/musketeers-fencing-karim-bashir-another-view","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2014/feb/03/musketeers-fencing-karim-bashir-another-view","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/another-view","webTitle":"Another view","type":"series","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/another-view","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/another-view","references":[]},{"id":"sport/fencing","webTitle":"Fencing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/fencing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/fencing","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/historical-drama","webTitle":"Historical drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/historical-drama","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/historical-drama","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/alexandredumaspere","webTitle":"Alexandre Dumas, pere","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alexandredumaspere","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/books/alexandredumaspere","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc","references":[]},{"id":"profile/laurabarnett","webTitle":"Laura Barnett","r2ContributorId":"25800","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2013/2/12/1360663866753/laura140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Laura Barnett is a freelance arts journalist and features writer.

Switzerland</strong><br />Interactive exhibits take pride of place in the newly extended and refurbished museum celebrating the Games. But the exhaustive collections can be… well, exhausting","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-02T13:40:42Z","body":"<p>The collection of the <a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/museum\" title=\"\">Olympic Museum in Lausanne</a> is reputed to include some 10,000 items. Sportswear being what it is, however, some pieces do tend to stick in the mind more than others. Wandering its refurbished circular galleries on a freezing cold morning last week (the museum, founded in 1993, has recently reopened following a two-year-long renovation by the British design consultancy <a href=\"http://www.matherandco.com/work/the-olympic-museum/\" title=\"\">Mather &amp; Co</a>), I could barely take in the amazing amount of Lycra on display; and once you've seen one pair of Adidas trainers, you've probably seen them all. But then I found myself standing in front of a two-man bobsleigh used by the Swiss team in the 1920s. Made almost entirely of wood, it looked for all the world like the sledge I had as a child; only a Swiss flag painted on its flimsy nose marked it out as kit for competition. Nearby stood a luge from the 1960s, another terrifyingly primitive affair consisting of a simple wooden frame, a webbed seat and a set of reins for steering (they looked to me just like a toddler's walking reins). Crikey. At last, my heart began to beat just a little faster.</p><p>The museum is in Ouchy, a quietly chic suburb of Lausanne on the shores of Lake Geneva. An undistinguished sugar cube of a building – it was designed by the Mexican architect <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/pedro-ramirez-vazquez-mexican-architect-dies-at-94.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Pedro Ramírez Vázquez</a> – it's set above a sculpture garden in which you will find sporty works of art by, among others, Gabor Mihaly (<em>Cyclistes</em>) and Niki de Saint Phalle (<a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/content/museum/mosaic/artworks/artist_de_coubertin2/\" title=\"\"><em>Les footballeurs</em></a>). Let's be honest, though: it isn't for great hunks of bronze and resin that anyone comes to this place. Of much more interest to most visitors will be the 100m running track just to the left of the museum's entrance on which it is possible, by means of a clever laser, to compare your own speed to that of the record-breaking Usain Bolt. (How did I do? Oh, you know, I wasn't wearing the right shoes… ) But be warned: this rust-red strip of bouncy rubber is also a sign of what's to come. The refurbished Olympic Museum is interactive to a quite wearying degree. Want to test your hand-eye co-ordination? Want to stand on an Olympic medal podium? Want to check your diet against that of a world-class athlete? Then you are in the right place.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428654611'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391197775345/torches-008.jpg' alt='torches' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A full set of Olympic torches. Photograph: Arnaud Meylan</figcaption></figure><p>There are three main galleries over three floors. The first deals with the history of the Games, the second with sport, and the third with \"spirit\", by which they mean that it's the taking part that counts (also, the fact that athletes really should not cheat). In gallery one, we kick off with a little light ancient history. Did the competition that was held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia have its origins in funeral games organised in honour of warriors killed in combat? The museum isn't saying, though it has obviously spent quite a lot of money on films that aim to reconstruct the sanctuary brick-by-brick. In this section, for obvious reasons, its main interest is Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the French educator who founded the modern Olympics in 1896. I was interested in Coubertin, a mustachioed fellow who tried and failed to popularise equestrian fencing, but was immediately frustrated by the museum's often wildly sketchy labelling. In pride of place was a copy of <em>Tom Brown's School Days</em>, Thomas Hughes's 1857 novel of public school life, with which, I gathered, Coubertin apparently had some kind of connection. Nowhere, though, could I find its influence on him or on his beloved games fully explained.</p><p>Moving on, we see the very first Olympic flag, made by the department store Le Bon Marché in 1913, and a full set of Olympic torches. Touch a screen in front of any of these, and you can call up both the name of its designer and the details of its journey from Greece to host country. (Ralph Lavers's stainless steel torch for the austerity Olympics in London in 1948 is a beautifully functional thing, while <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/30/sports/olympics/passing-the-torch-an-evolution-of-form.html\" title=\"\">Philippe Starck's horn-shaped affair</a> for the Winter Olympics in Albertville in 1992 resembles nothing so much as a particularly ugly shower fitting.) A display that aims to show the historical and political context of each games works in similar fashion. Touch the screen, choose a year, and you will find yourself in a \"surround sound\" bubble, a voice dolefully giving you all the news headlines. It's a strategy that makes the Olympics seem effortlessly miraculous, a triumph of hope over experience. Pick 1948, for instance, and the first face that appears before you belongs to Joe Stalin.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428654609'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391095368686/The-running-track-at-the--011.jpg' alt='The running track at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. Interactive exhibits predominate.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The running track at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, where interactive exhibits predominate. Photograph: Arnaud Melan</figcaption></figure><p>A large part of this floor is devoted to marketing, and thanks to these displays, I now blame Los Angeles (1984) for the plastic tat each new Olympics brings forth. Before LA, there was real elegance to be found in the design of each games, from the art&nbsp;deco glasses and toffee tins that were manufactured for Amsterdam in 1928 to the fantastic op-art patterns that were such a big part of Mexico in 1968 (in the museum shop, I came alarmingly close to buying an Adidas shoulder bag with \"Mexico '68\" written across it). A collection of beautiful paper and silk fans celebrating the games goes all the way back to Stockholm in 1912. But after LA, it was downhill all the way (and hence to London, the jagged pink emblem for which was so outstandingly unattractive). In another part of this space, the visitor is invited to gaze on a motley selection of costumes from various opening ceremonies and, as a result, to consider yet again the genius of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/london-2012-opening-ceremony-reviews\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a> (though Moschino's snowy dresses for the Winter Olympics in Turin 2006, which are decorated with miniature mountains, fir trees and skiers, are quite lovely up close).</p><p>I've already told you about the bobsleighs and luges to be found in the second gallery. But those in the market for this kind of sporting memorabilia will also doubtless enjoy looking at Jesse Owens's running shoes, a 19th-century Elswick racing bike with only one gear, and a cap that once belonged to Harvey Wood, the goalkeeper of the British hockey team in 1908. I can also reveal that Sir Chris Hoy's unitard – is that the right word? – from London 2012 is in excellent nick save for some light stretching in the groin area. Visit the museum soon, moreover, and you'll enjoy the bonus of a display dedicated to fencing (it is the centenary of the International Fencing Federation). Among the wonderful collection of masks on show is one that dates from 1760; it looks like an old egg basket sawn in two.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428654610'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391197559840/moschino-dress-001.jpg' alt='moschino dress' width='220' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>One of Moschino’s dresses for the Winter Olympics \r\nin Turin 2006, decorated with miniature mountains, \r\nfir trees and skiers.</figcaption></figure><p>The third gallery is the weakest by far, ideas being so much harder to convey in a museum context than stories. You sense, too, the anxiety of the International Olympic Committee, which owns the museum and everything in it, about how best to treat the issue of doping. Visitors are, for instance, invited to look down a microscope beneath whose \"lens\" they will see photographs of the side-effects of banned drugs (acne for steroids, chapped lips for overuse of diuretics). But nowhere will you find hard facts about the success or otherwise of the drug-testing programme, or indeed the names of athletes who have been banned. Mostly what I learned from this section is that if Olympic medals continue to grow in size the way they have over the last 50 years, they will soon be as big as dinner plates. (Also, that a Michelin man-style \"concentration coat\" used by the Swiss team at Salt Lake City in 2002 – it was supposed to \"cocoon\" the athlete from the world, the better that he or she would be able to concentrate pre-race – was a resounding failure.)</p><p>But I was also, by this point, as weary as any post-race athlete. The museum is exhaustive, and thus both quite big and quite repetitive. In this sense, it's surely a destination mostly for the Olympics obsessive, of whom there seem to be quite a few, rather than for the casual visitor (more than 45,000 people have passed through its doors since it reopened in December). Returning to retrieve my coat from my locker – I was using one marked with the name of Bruce Baumgartner, a freestyle wrestler who won gold at the LA Olympics, Bradley Wiggins's having disappointingly already been taken – I sat on a nearby bench for a moment, and closed my eyes. Oh, the Olympic Museum mark two has a great deal to recommend it – especially if, like me, you're perfectly happy to spend half an hour watching old clips of Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe battling it out. But there are also moments when it's like being shouted at: \"Aren't the Olympics great?\" yells the voice in your ear. \"Aren't the Olympics just great?\"</p>","headline":"Olympic Museum – review","trailText":"<p>Interactive exhibits take pride of place in the newly extended and refurbished museum celebrating the Games.

Her films, drawings, photos and installations often seek to examine the concept of narrative, exploring the subjective nature of memory and \"the means by which artefacts are borrowed, adapted and reconfigured to tell various stories\". Sworn's most recent solo exhibitions include The Rag Papers&gt; at the Chisenhale Gallery, London, and the Neuer Aachener Kunstverein, Germany, and Endless Renovation, which was part of Tate Britain's Art Now programme. Her video work <em>Lens Prism</em> (2010) opened the Whitechapel Gallery's 2012 Artists' Film International and her short film <em>The Foxes</em> featured in the 2013 London film festival's Experimenta series. Sworn was recently announced as the winner of the Max Mara art prize for women – an accolade previously bestowed upon artists including Laure Prouvost, Andrea Büttner and Margaret Salmon.</p><h2><strong>City: Shanghai</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504890'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391002306689/Shanghai-007.jpg' alt='Shanghai' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I just got back from Shanghai, which was wild. It's grown so enormously, it's mind-boggling. It filled me with awe and trepidation. We went to the Urban Planning Exhibition Centre and it had a picture of Shanghai in 1984 and then another of the skyline today; the 1984 skyline is absolutely unrecognisable. In 30 years, the city has completely changed. Our hosts were very generous and took us around China to eat different types of food. The most fun thing was having a hot pot, which was like a big heated soup over a gas burner in the middle of table and you just order various vegetables and meats, and dip them into the soup to cook them.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plainwater-Vintage-Contemporaries-Anne-Carson/dp/0375708421/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391009504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Anne+Carson+plainwater\">Book: Plainwater by Anne Carson</a></strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504891'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391001570392/Anne-Carson-002.jpg' alt='Anne Carson' width='140' height='215' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I read this book of essays and poetry in the summer. As you read things, you're reading both the texture of the words and the ideas that they unfold. It's unusual to be able to hold both things in your mind at once while reading... but somehow you're able to do both with this book. <br />There's one section of poems called \"short talks\" – prose poems that are about a paragraph long, like little lectures. I've read bits and pieces of her work before, but this was the first book. I picked it up in a bookshop in Toronto – one of these wonderful bookshops where you go in thinking that you'll be there for just a minute and you end up gradually falling in love with more and more books.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.duolingo.com/\">App: Duolingo</a></strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504892'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391002003962/Duolingo-app-004.jpg' alt='Duolingo app' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I've been playing this free app for learning languages, which is really fun. You just play games to learn the language. A lot of them are repetitive, but that repetition helps you to memorise vocabulary. I'm trying to learn Italian as I will spend six months in Italy next year. </p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://catrionajeffries.com/artists/julia-feyrer/works/\">Art: Julia Feyrer</a></strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504893'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391002206784/Bottles-under-the-Influen-004.jpg' alt='Bottles under the Influence by Julie Feyrer' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bottles Under the Influence by Julie Feyrer.</figcaption></figure><p>She has an exhibition at the Western Front in Vancouver and I wish I could go to see it. She makes films and installations that often have a wild sense of invention and they crazily unpack ideas that you think of as being in the domain of order or reason. I'd seen her films before in Vancouver and then I was invited by Tramway in Glasgow to curate a collection of films, and I included her work. Her work can also be seen on the <a href=\"http://catrionajeffries.com/artists/julia-feyrer/works/\" title=\"\">Catriona Jefferies Gallery website</a>.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/\">Website: PennSound</a></strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504894'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391001944885/PennSound-002.jpg' alt='PennSound' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I spend a lot of time listening to the <a href=\"http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/\" title=\"\">PennSound</a> website. I like David Antin's \"talk poems\".PennSound has an archive of poetry readings and interviews with poets. I like reading poetry but, because it's organised sonically, to be able to listen to poetry is really pleasurable. I listen a lot in the studio while I'm working – it's kind of a way of having company, especially if I'm doing something that is quite labour-intensive but the focus it requires is more general, more like patience.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.juno.co.uk/products/lurists-volume-one-red-blue/511734-01/\">Volume One: Red &amp; Blue by Lurists</a> </strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428504895'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391002433740/Volume-One-Red--Blue-by-L-003.jpg' alt='Volume One: Red & Blue by Lurists ' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I've seen Richard Youngs and Luke Fowler, of Lurists, play together quite a bit and each performance is very different from the last; always a sort of playful exploration. This is a collaboration with another person, Heatsick. I like seeing Richard and Luke as they seem to meld such opposing sounds. Where Richard adds the casual yearning of folk, Luke plays erratic sci-fi sounds with synthesisers… and somehow it works. Their last collaboration was at Nice'N'Sleazy's in Glasgow where they played with Paul Thomson of Franz Ferdinand. Their music is getting dancier and if you found a way to dance to it the moves you'd make to this album would be pretty erratic and zany.</p>","headline":"On my radar: Corin Sworn's cultural

We'll be appealing the decision.\"</p><p>Records show that the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Calosha) cited Cybernet for a number of violations after an inspection last August. The largest part of the fine, $75,000, targeted Cybernet's policy allowing its performers to choose whether or not to use condoms.</p><p>A CalOSHA spokesman, Peter Melton, said there had been several complaints against Kink.com last year, and described the fine as \"significant\".</p><p>The inspection was prompted by a formal complaint filed against Kink.com by the Aids Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-headquartered advocacy group. In 2012, the AHF Foundation successfully lobbied for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/25/la-porn-pullout-condom-law\">condom requirements on porn sets in the city of Los Angeles and later for all of LA County</a>.</p><p>The group has remained a driving force behind the regulations, successfully defending the county measure in court when the county declined to, reporting suspected violations to government officials, and suing companies who try to move parts of their productions outside the area.</p><p>\"We're all for sensible regulation that protects performers,\" Mike Stabile, a spokesman for Kink.com, said in response to the foundation's complaints, \"but this essentially amounts to a moral crusade. It's a solution in search of a problem.\"</p><p>The foundation filed the complaints after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/12/porn-industry-california-hiv-condoms\">two Kink.com performers who were romantically involved tested HIV-positive last year</a>. The company said testing determined that the performers contracted the infection in their private lives rather than on set.</p><p>For the Aids Healthcare Foundation, whether the performers contracted HIV on set or in their private lives is of little consequence.<br></p><p>\"That's neither here nor there,\" a foundation spokesman, Ged Kenslea, said, \"because Osha requires that condoms be used. An HIV test is not a form of prevention.”</p><p>Earlier this month, another Bay Area adult film company, Treasure Island Media, lost its appeal of a similar Osha citation and was fined close to $9,000.</p><p>Last September, California lawmakers voted down a bill that would have required porn actors to use condoms during filming, but Calosha rules require companies to minimise employees' exposure to blood and other potentially infectious bodily fluids.</p><p>The last confirmed on-set HIV infection was in 2004, after which the adult film industry adopted testing of all active performers biweekly for a range of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, hepatitis and HIV.<br></p>","headline":"Porn company fined for allowing performers to work without

He made his way to a spot on the cobblestones not far from the marble mausoleum housing the waxy corpse of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/21/the-guardian-interviews-lenin-1919\" title=\"\">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and began to undress. In less than a minute, he was naked.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/nov/11/russian-artist-nails-testicles-red-square-cobbles-video\" title=\"\">A video taken using a handheld camera</a> and posted online moments later shows tourists gawping as he sits on the ground. A police car arrives, and an officer orders the man to get up. But the man cannot get up – because he is attached to the icy cobbles with a single, long nail that is driven through his scrotum and into the stones below.</p><p>This was only the third piece of protest art in the oeuvre of St Petersburg native Petr Pavlensky, but he has already made a name for himself as one of the most intriguing figures on the contemporary Russian art scene. Tapping into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/24/pussy-riot-behind-balaclava\" title=\"\">the instincts that drove Pussy Riot</a>, and their progenitors, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/12/voina-art-terrorism\" title=\"\">the Voina art collective</a>, Pavlensky fuses risque performance with a deep disdain for the current political environment in Russia. <a href=\"http://escap1sts.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/petr-pavlensky/\" title=\"\">Having previously wrapped himself naked in a coil of barbed wire, and sewn his lips together</a>, this third wince-inducing stunt attracted international&nbsp;attention.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429046616'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391614005883/Pyotr-Pavlensky-with-sewn-011.jpg' alt='Pyotr Pavlensky with sewn up mouth' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pussy Riot supporter and artist Petr Pavlensky protests outside Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg in 2012. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement released to coincide with the performance, Pavlensky said his action, titled Fixation and timed to coincide with Russia's annual Police Day, was \"a metaphor for the apathy, political indifference and fatalism of modern Russian society\". Pavlensky had a blanket thrown over him by the confused police officers and was eventually detached from the stones and taken to hospital. He was discharged that evening, and released by the police without charge – only for them to open a case of \"hooliganism motivated by hatred of a particular social, ethnic or religious group\" a few days later. It is the same article of the law that was used against Pussy Riot and can carry a jail sentence of several&nbsp;years.</p><p>A fortnight later, Pavlensky is at the railway station in St Petersburg, about to take the night train back to the capital, where he has been summoned by police for questioning the next day. There are rumours in the media that he may be arrested. We meet just before midnight, before he boards his train, and it is hard not to notice the rather forlorn canvas rucksack slung over his shoulder. He appears to have surprisingly few possessions with him for someone who could end up spending months behind bars.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"I've got socks, pants, everything. I'm ready for anything.\"</p><p>He sounds relaxed and confident, although there is a nervous intensity in his eyes. Escaping the long arm of Russian justice by going on the run was never an option for Pavlensky. \"I think that would have discredited everything I'd done before, if at the first sign of danger I'd gone into hiding. So I decided to take a position of strength, because there is nothing to be afraid of. You can be afraid if you feel you are guilty of something and I don't. Anything the authorities do against me means discrediting themselves. The more they do with me, the worse they make it for themselves.\"</p><p>He says the same impulse informs his art: \"Whenever I do a performance like this, I never leave the place. It's important for me that I stay there. The authorities are in a dead-end situation and don't know what to do. They can't ask the person to leave a square, because he's nailed to the square. And they can't do anything with a man inside barbed wire.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marat_Gelman\" title=\"\">The influential gallery owner and critic Marat Guelman</a> called Pavlensky's act \"the artistic equivalent of setting yourself on fire\" and said it was a gesture of hopelessness and desperation. \"It was a message to society,\" he told the Calvert Journal. \"We all more or less share his position. People have been forced into a corner – the choice is between leaving, going to prison, or joining up with those in&nbsp;power.\"</p><p>But, in Pavlensky's mind, his action was less a helpless cry of anguish than an aggressive statement of defiance. His performances are not only a protest against the system, but also a protest against people's apathy. \"When I did the Carcass piece with the barbed wire, I was not just saying how wonderful our legal system is – people are inside this wire, which torments them, stops them from moving, and they feel pain from every movement. I&nbsp;was also saying people themselves are this barbed wire and create the wire for&nbsp;themselves.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429046617'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391614217337/Pyotr-Pavlensky-lies-on-t-009.jpg' alt='Pyotr Pavlensky lies on the ground, wrapped in barbed wire roll' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Artist Petr Pavlensky lies on the ground, wrapped in barbed wire roll, during a protest action in St Petersburg, 3 May, 2013. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Pavlensky was born in St Petersburg and studied at art college, which he describes as a \"disciplinary institution that aims to make servants out of artists\". He left in 2012, without completing the course. He says he has a broad range of artistic influences. \"I am very interested in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog+caravaggio\" title=\"\">Caravaggio</a>, even though he worked with canvas and oils. He had a very serious life project, though: he made works with the theme of self-harm, where he translates real events on to the bodies of his subjects. He isn't a decorative artist. I am very critical of any decorative art as an idea, the idea of ornamentalism and concealment. Everything that does the opposite, that brings things out and reveals how things actually are, this is what interests me.\"</p><p>Pavlensky takes inspiration from a long line of Russian protests, particularly the \"Moscow activism\" school of the 1990s, and most recently the protest group Voina, who were noted for their outrageous activist art. Voina's performances included staging a mass orgy inside Moscow's biological museum the day before the election of Dmitry Medvedev as president in 2008, under a banner that read: \"Fuck&nbsp;for the teddy bear heir.\"</p><p>Later, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/13694493\" title=\"\">they painted a giant penis on a St Petersburg bridge, just before it was raised at night for ships to pass, causing the penis to \"erect\" and point at the FSB security services building</a> on the embankment. The group <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Russian+youth+organisation+presents+ministry+of+culture+with+plywood+phallus/23568\" title=\"\">won a major art prize for the stunt</a> (the Innovatzia, the equivalent of the Turner prize), though they were also pursued by Russian authorities on criminal charges.</p><p>Two of the original Voina artists went on to form the punk collective Pussy Riot, who with their mix of music, art and activism also chose Red Square for one of the first performances, in 2011. Later, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grEBLskpDWQ\" title=\"\">they would stage their fateful action in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour</a>, which would see three of them stand trial for \"hooliganism motivated by religious&nbsp;hatred\".</p><p>Pavlensky says it was during the Pussy Riot trial that he first began to understand the need for a more radical approach to art. \"Their trial affected me more than many things in my own life. I started looking at other people and wondering why they were not doing anything. And that is when I had the important realisation that you should not wait for things from other people. You need to do things&nbsp;yourself.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-422200867\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/11/11/131111Testicles-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/11/11/131111Testicles_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/11/11/131111Testicles/131111Testicles.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/11/11/131111Testicles_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The idea for his most recent performance came when he was briefly held in a cell after the Carcass stunt. A fellow prisoner regaled him with stories of the Gulag, where prisoners had sometimes nailed their scrotums to trees in an act of protest at the inhumane conditions and miserable existence. \"I didn't think much of it at first but then, when I began thinking that the whole country is becoming a prison system, that Russia is turning into a big prison and a police state, it seemed perfect.\"</p><p>Some suggested that the act may not have been as gruesome as it seemed, with a piercing having been made prior to the event and the nail simply pushed through, but as we walk along the freezing platform for him to board the Moscow train, Pavlensky insists that he actually drove the nail through that afternoon. \"I have the medical report to prove it,\" he says. \"I was careful not to rupture a vein but it was very bloody and sore. They wanted to give me antibiotics and other medications, but I refused.\"</p><p>In the end, Pavlensky was not arrested at his questioning the following day in Moscow, but the charges against him still stand, and he remains under investigation. In late January, officers arrived at the cable channel TV Rain and demanded to be given a recording of an interview Pavlensky had given them, saying they needed to examine it as part of a \"psychological-linguistic expert analysis\" that was being carried out as part of the case against him.</p><p>Despite the real threat of a jail term, Pavlensky does not plan to stop, and says his unusually painful brand of art comes from an imperative impulse towards radicalism: \"It was a very important step for me – to understand what happens when a person becomes an artist, when a person becomes stronger than their indifference and overcomes their inertia. I don't think an artist can exist without this and just be isolated and contemplative. An artist has no right not to take a stand.\"</p>","headline":"Petr Pavlensky: why I nailed my scrotum to Red Square","trailText":"<p>He has wrapped himself in barbed wire, sewn his lips shut and caused the world to wince with his now-infamous stunt in Moscow.
