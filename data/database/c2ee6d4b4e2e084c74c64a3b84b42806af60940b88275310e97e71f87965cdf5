The company denied any prior knowledge of the program, accusing the agencies of \"a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy\".</p><p>GCHQ does not have the technical means to make sure no images of UK or US citizens are collected and stored by the system, and there are no restrictions under UK law to prevent Americans' images being accessed by British analysts without an individual warrant.</p><p>The documents also chronicle GCHQ's sustained struggle to keep the large store of sexually explicit imagery collected by Optic Nerve away from the eyes of its staff, though there is little discussion about the privacy implications of storing this material in the first place.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430961034'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393452070858/NSA-ragout-4-001.jpg' alt='NSA ragout 4' width='460' height='365' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>Optic Nerve, the documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden show, began as a prototype in 2008 and was still active in 2012, according to an internal GCHQ wiki page accessed that year.</p><p>The system, eerily reminiscent of the telescreens evoked in George Orwell's 1984, was used for experiments in automated facial recognition, to monitor GCHQ's existing targets, and to discover new targets of interest. Such searches could be used to try to find terror suspects or criminals making use of multiple, anonymous user IDs.</p><p>Rather than collecting webcam chats in their entirety, the program saved one image every five minutes from the users' feeds, partly to comply with human rights legislation, and also to avoid overloading GCHQ's servers. The documents describe these users as \"unselected\" – intelligence agency parlance for bulk rather than targeted collection.</p><p>One document even likened the program's \"bulk access to Yahoo webcam images/events\" to a massive digital police mugbook of previously arrested individuals.</p><p>\"Face detection has the potential to aid selection of useful images for 'mugshots' or even for face recognition by assessing the angle of the face,\" it reads. \"The best images are ones where the person is facing the camera with their face upright.\"</p><p>The agency did make efforts to limit analysts' ability to see webcam images, restricting bulk searches to metadata only.</p><p>However, analysts were shown the faces of people with similar usernames to surveillance targets, potentially dragging in large numbers of innocent people. One document tells agency staff they were allowed to display \"webcam images associated with similar Yahoo identifiers to your known target\".</p><p>Optic Nerve was based on collecting information from GCHQ's huge network of internet cable taps, which was then processed and fed into systems provided by the NSA. Webcam information was fed into NSA's XKeyscore search tool, and NSA research was used to build the tool which identified Yahoo's webcam traffic.</p><p>Bulk surveillance on Yahoo users was begun, the documents said, because \"Yahoo webcam is known to be used by GCHQ targets\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430961035'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393452051275/NSA-ragout-3-001.jpg' alt='NSA ragout 3' width='460' height='120' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>Programs like Optic Nerve, which collect information in bulk from largely anonymous user IDs, are unable to filter out information from UK or US citizens. Unlike the NSA, GCHQ is not required by UK law to \"minimize\", or remove, domestic citizens' information from its databases. However, additional legal authorisations are required before analysts can search for the data of individuals likely to be in the British Isles at the time of the search.</p><p>There are no such legal safeguards for searches on people believed to be in the US or the other allied \"Five Eyes\" nations – Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</p><p>GCHQ insists all of its activities are necessary, proportionate, and in accordance with UK law.</p><p>The documents also show that GCHQ trialled automatic searches based on facial recognition technology, for people resembling existing GCHQ targets: \"[I]f you search for similar IDs to your target, you will be able to request automatic comparison of the face in the similar IDs to those in your target's ID\".</p><p>The undated document, from GCHQ's internal wiki information site, noted this capability was \"now closed … but shortly to return!\"</p><p>The privacy risks of mass collection from video sources have long been known to the NSA and GCHQ, as a research document from the mid-2000s noted: \"One of the greatest hindrances to exploiting video data is the fact that the vast majority of videos received have no intelligence value whatsoever, such as pornography, commercials, movie clips and family home movies.\"</p><p>Sexually explicit webcam material proved to be a particular problem for GCHQ, as one document delicately put it: \"Unfortunately … it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person. Also, the fact that the Yahoo software allows more than one person to view a webcam stream without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream means that it appears sometimes to be used for broadcasting pornography.\"</p><p>The document estimates that between 3% and 11% of the Yahoo webcam imagery harvested by GCHQ contains \"undesirable nudity\". Discussing efforts to make the interface \"safer to use\", it noted that current \"naïve\" pornography detectors assessed the amount of flesh in any given shot, and so attracted lots of false positives by incorrectly tagging shots of people's faces as pornography.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430961036'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393452001667/NSA-ragout-1-001.jpg' alt='NSA ragout 1' width='460' height='163' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>GCHQ did not make any specific attempts to prevent the collection or storage of explicit images, the documents suggest, but did eventually compromise by excluding images in which software had not detected any faces from search results – a bid to prevent many of the lewd shots being seen by analysts.</p><p>The system was not perfect at stopping those images reaching the eyes of GCHQ staff, though. An internal guide cautioned prospective Optic Nerve users that \"there is no perfect ability to censor material which may be offensive. Users who may feel uncomfortable about such material are advised not to open them\".</p><p>It further notes that \"under GCHQ's offensive material policy, the dissemination of offensive material is a disciplinary offence\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430961037'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393452030724/NSA-ragout-2-001.jpg' alt='NSA ragout 2' width='460' height='366' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>Once collected, the metadata associated with the videos can be as valuable to the intelligence agencies as the images themselves.</p><p>It is not fully clear from the documents how much access the NSA has to the Yahoo webcam trove itself, though all of the policy documents were available to NSA analysts through their routine information-sharing. A previously revealed NSA metadata repository, codenamed Marina, has what the documents describe as a protocol class for webcam information.</p><p>In its statement to the Guardian, Yahoo strongly condemned the Optic Nerve program, and said it had no awareness of or involvement with the GCHQ collection.</p><p>\"We were not aware of, nor would we condone, this reported activity,\" said a spokeswoman. \"This report, if true, represents a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy that is completely unacceptable, and we strongly call on the world's governments to reform surveillance law consistent with the principles we outlined in December.</p><p>\"We are committed to preserving our users' trust and security and continue our efforts to expand encryption across all of our services.\"</p><p>Yahoo has been one of the most outspoken technology companies objecting to the NSA's bulk surveillance. It filed a transparency lawsuit with the secret US surveillance court to disclose a 2007 case in which it was compelled to provide customer data to the surveillance agency, and it railed against the NSA's reported interception of information in transit between its data centers.</p><p>The documents do not refer to any specific court orders permitting collection of Yahoo's webcam imagery, but GCHQ mass collection is governed by the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and requires certification by the foreign secretary, currently William Hague.</p><p>The Optic Nerve documentation shows legalities were being considered as new capabilities were being developed. Discussing adding automated facial matching, for example, analysts agreed to test a system before firming up its legal status for everyday use.</p><p>\"It was agreed that the legalities of such a capability would be considered once it had been developed, but that the general principle applied would be that if the accuracy of the algorithm was such that it was useful to the analyst (ie, the number of spurious results was low, then it was likely to be proportionate),\" the 2008 document reads.</p><p>The document continues: \"This is allowed for research purposes but at the point where the results are shown to analysts for operational use, the proportionality and legality questions must be more carefully considered.\"</p><p>Optic Nerve was just one of a series of GCHQ efforts at biometric detection, whether for target recognition or general security.</p><p>While the documents do not detail efforts as widescale as those against Yahoo users, one presentation discusses with interest the potential and capabilities of the Xbox 360's Kinect camera, saying it generated \"fairly normal webcam traffic\" and was being evaluated as part of a wider program.</p><p>Documents previously revealed in the Guardian showed the NSA were exploring the video capabilities of game consoles for surveillance purposes.</p><p>Microsoft, the maker of Xbox, faced a privacy backlash last year when details emerged that the camera bundled with its new console, the Xbox One, would be always-on by default.</p><p>Beyond webcams and consoles, GCHQ and the NSA looked at building more detailed and accurate facial recognition tools, such as iris recognition cameras – \"think Tom Cruise in Minority Report\", one presentation noted.</p><p>The same presentation talks about the strange means the agencies used to try and test such systems, including whether they could be tricked. One way of testing this was to use contact lenses on detailed mannequins.</p><p>To this end, GCHQ has a dummy nicknamed \"the Head\", one document noted.</p><p>In a statement, a GCHQ spokesman said: \"It is a longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters. </p><p>\"Furthermore, all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.</p><p>\"All our operational processes rigorously support this position.\"</p><p>The NSA declined to respond to specific queries about its access to the Optic Nerve system, the presence of US citizens' data in such systems, or whether the NSA has similar bulk-collection programs.</p><p>However, NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the agency did not ask foreign partners such as GCHQ to collect intelligence the agency could not legally collect itself.</p><p>\"As we've said before, the National Security Agency does not ask its foreign partners to undertake any intelligence activity that the US government would be legally prohibited from undertaking itself,\" she said.</p><p>\"The NSA works with a number of partners in meeting its foreign intelligence mission goals, and those operations comply with US law and with the applicable laws under which those partners operate. </p><p>\"A key part of the protections that apply to both US persons and citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and comply with US Attorney General-approved procedures to protect privacy rights. Those procedures govern the acquisition, use, and retention of information about US persons.\"</p>","headline":"Optic Nerve: millions of Yahoo webcam images intercepted by GCHQ","trailText":"<p>• Optic Nerve program collected Yahoo webcam images in bulk<br />• 1.8m users targeted by UK agency in six-month period alone<br />• Yahoo: 'A whole new level of violation of our users' privacy'<br />• Material included large quantity of sexually explicit images</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n57z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393508802859/cdf1262e-9c5e-42ee-b28c-8b26b1966918-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1882","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo","tags":[{"id":"world/the-nsa-files","webTitle":"The NSA files","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/the-nsa-files","references":[]},{"id":"world/nsa","webTitle":"NSA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nsa","references":[]},{"id":"uk/gchq","webTitle":"GCHQ","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/gchq","references":[]},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/surveillance","references":[]},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/privacy","references":[]},{"id":"technology/data-protection","webTitle":"Data protection","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/data-protection","references":[]},{"id":"technology/yahoo","webTitle":"Yahoo","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/yahoo","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/web-browsers","webTitle":"Web browsers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/web-browsers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/web-browsers","references":[]},{"id":"technology/telecoms","webTitle":"Telecoms","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/telecoms","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/telecoms","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/spencerackerman","webTitle":"Spencer Ackerman","r2ContributorId":"22229","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/7/1370612137660/SpencerAckerman.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Spencer Ackerman is national security editor for Guardian US.

The safety of the president is not being followed.</p><p>“I want you to know the position of Moscow is that you will not be left alone or be in trouble.</p><p>“Everyone is afraid of Russia. We have the most modern weapons, the most impressive.

Three MIT graduate students wanted to expose how dodgy scientific conferences pestered researchers for papers, and accepted any old rubbish sent in, knowing that academics would stump up the hefty, till-ringing registration fees.</p><p>It took only a handful of days. The students wrote a simple computer program that churned out gobbledegook and presented it as <a href=\"http://www.pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdf\">an academic paper</a>. They put their names on one of the papers, sent it to a conference, and promptly had it accepted. The sting, in 2005, revealed a farce that lay at the heart of science.</p><p>But this is the hoax that keeps on giving. The creators of the automatic nonsense generator, Jeremy Stribling, Dan Aguayo and Maxwell Krohn, have made the <a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/\" title=\"\">SCIgen</a> program free to download. And scientists have been <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763\" title=\"\">using it in their droves</a>. This week, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763\">Nature reported</a>, French researcher Cyril Labbé revealed that 16 gobbledegook papers created by SCIgen had been used by German academic publisher Springer. More than 100 more fake SCIgen papers were published by the US Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). Both organisations have now taken steps to remove the papers.</p><p>Hoaxes in academia are nothing new. In 1996, mathematician Alan Sokal riled postmodernists by publishing a nonsense paper in the leading US journal, Social Text. It was laden with meaningless phrases but, as Sokal said, it sounded good to them. Other fields have not been immune. In 1964, critics of modern art were wowed by the work of Pierre Brassau, who turned out to be a four-year-old chimpanzee. In a more convoluted case, Bernard-Henri Lévy, one of France's best-known philosophers, was left to ponder his own expertise after quoting the lectures of Jean-Baptiste Botul as evidence that Kant  was a fake, only to find out that Botul was the fake, an invention of a French reporter.</p><p>Just as the students wrote a quick and dirty program to churn out nonsense papers, so Labbé has written one to spot the papers. He has made it <a href=\"http://scigendetection.imag.fr/main.php\" title=\"\">freely available</a>, so publishers and conference organisers have no excuse for accepting nonsense work in future.</p><p>Krohn, who has now founded a startup called Keybase.io in New York that provides encryption to programmers, said Labbé's detective work revealed how deep the problem ran. Academics are under intense pressure to publish, conferences and journals want to turn their papers into profits, and universities want them published. \"This ought to be a shock to people,\" Krohn said. \"There's this whole academic underground where everyone seems to benefit, but they are wasting time and money and adding nothing to science. The institutions are being ripped off, because they pay publishers huge subscriptions for this stuff.\"</p><p>Krohn sees an arms race brewing, in which computers churn out ever more convincing papers, while other programs are designed to sniff them out. Does he regret the beast he helped unleash, or is he proud that it is still exposing weaknesses in the world of science? \"I'm psyched, it's so great. These papers are so funny, you read them and can't help but laugh. They are total bullshit. And I don't see this going away.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 27 February 2014, to cite Nature as the source of the story</p>","headline":"How computer-generated fake papers are flooding academia","trailText":"<p>More and more academic papers that are essentially gobbledegook are being written by computer programs – and accepted at conferences</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n53p","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393439695073/Ive-written-five-PhDs-on--001.jpg","wordcount":"540","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/feb/26/how-computer-generated-fake-papers-flooding-academia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/feb/26/how-computer-generated-fake-papers-flooding-academia","tags":[{"id":"science/peer-review-scientific-publishing","webTitle":"Peer review and scientific publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/peer-review-scientific-publishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/peer-review-scientific-publishing","references":[]},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/shortcuts","webTitle":"Shortcuts","type":"blog","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/shortcuts","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","webTitle":"Comment & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/iansample","webTitle":"Ian Sample","rcsId":"GNL006496","r2ContributorId":"15749","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/ian_sample_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian Sample has been a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science\">science</a> correspondent for the Guardian since 2003.

Considering the respective Premier League positions, personnel and recent spending of both teams, it's small wonder that Gus Poyet's side can be backed at odds of 4-1 against winning the Cup outright (they're nearly 9-1 to do so in 90 minutes) and if anything, those prizes seem a bit stingy. But City might not have it all their own way against a very poor side they've occasionally found it inexplicably difficult to beat in recent years. Sunderland have famously beaten City 1-0 in four consecutive Premier League match-ups at the Stadium of Light, although their record away from home – two hidings and a draw – is decidedly less impressive. On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\" title=\"\">Thursday's Football Weekly podcast</a> Iain Macintosh mused that the window of opportunity for catching Manchester City unawares in cup finals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup\" title=\"\">may have shut behind Wigan</a>, but unconvincing recent performances against Barcelona, Stoke and Norwich suggest Sunderland, who on their day aren't a great deal worse than at least two of those teams, are not without a chance. The hapless Robbo's unfortunate record may be safe for yet another year. <strong>BG</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/26/sunderland-league-cup-final-wembley-david-corner\" title=\"\">Jonathan Wilson: thoughts of a Sunderland win are scary</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/gus-poyet-sunderland-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">Poyet ranks Capital One Cup success above survival</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/27/manchester-city-league-cup-final-sheikh-mansour\" title=\"\">David Conn: City have changed since last League Cup final</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>2) Will Atlético stop the Real juggernaut?</h2><p></p><p>Meanwhile in Spain, which the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed is also not the Premier League, Atlético Madrid go toe-to-toe with their city rivals on Sunday afternoon, in a contest that ought to go a long way towards deciding who is crowned La Liga champions this season. The Real juggernaut has been roaring forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/carlo-ancelotti-praise-bbc-real-madrid-schalke\" title=\"\">on all fronts at full throttle</a> and surprise recent defeats for their title rivals Barcelona and Atlético have enabled <em>Los Blancos</em> to open a three-point lead on the pair, having been five points behind at Christmas.

The clubs' relationship since the  incident has deteriorated into a long-term and somewhat bizarre reciprocal resentment. A few months after Ryan Shawcross's misjudged tackle on Ramsey – an incident for which the Stoke defender was immediately and overwhelmingly contrite – Wenger suggested of him in particular, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/03/arsene-wenger-tony-pulis-tactics\" title=\"\">and Stoke's muscular tactics in general</a>, that \"you cannot say it is football any more.

This week Coates harrumphed that after the tackle Shawcross had been \"very badly treated\" in a way that \"was wholly unfair on him\".</p><p></p><p>Since 2010 Wenger has occasionally hinted that he has forgiven Shawcross, saying in 2012 that \"he has improved as a player and cleaned up his act\", and occasionally suggested he hasn't, such as after the defender was booked for fouling Laurent Koscielny a year ago. \"It looked like a red card to me,\" he said, \"but I am maybe not completely objective when it comes to Ryan Shawcross.\" Ramsay of course recovered, and when he scored Arsenal's first goal in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/22/arsenal-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">a 3-1 win over Stoke at the Emirates last September</a> put a finger to his lips and looked at the visiting fans. As a result of which one Stoke fanzine has blamed him for \"keeping this pantomime going\". That fanzine article, which <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenals-aaron-ramsey-facing-hot-reception-from-stoke-crowd-9148611.html\" title=\"\">roared around Twitter and the like this week</a>, concluded that Arsenal should attempt \"no whining and trying to take the moral high ground when you get the kind of reception your actions have inevitably guaranteed\". Add to the mix <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/03/mark-hughes-arsene-wenger-carling-cup\" title=\"\">a five-year-old feud between Wenger and Mark Hughes</a>  and another bad-tempered encounter starts to appear inexplicably and regrettably inevitable. <strong>SB</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/mesut-ozil-arsenal-break-arsene-wenger\" title=\"\">Özil will be better for his Arsenal break, insists Wenger</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/21/charlie-adam-stoke-city-liverpool-mark-hughes\" title=\"\">Big interview: Charlie Adam finds his goalscoring boots</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>4) Lovren looks to lift Saints' defence against Liverpool</h2><p></p><p>Mauricio Pochettino has a 100% record against Liverpool, having been responsible for Brendan Rodgers's last two home defeats in the Premier League. But if Liverpool have struggled against Southampton at Anfield of late they have fared little better away – they have won on only one of their four visits to St Mary's (losing the rest) and, before that, only one of their last four visits to the Dell. On the other hand, their strikers are not so much pulling up trees as uprooting entire forests, with Daniel Sturridge seeking a goal in his ninth successive appearance.</p><p></p><p>Dejan Lovren's return from injury offers Southampton the hope of rediscovering their early-season parsimony, the Croatian's central-defensive partnership with José Fonte having been the bedrock of those achievements but more recently endured more than a month of enforced separation. Lovren insisted this week that \"we want to finish in the best position we can … I hope it will be the sixth place. That would be an amazing place for us, and we can achieve it.\" Impressive optimism for a man who, in nine appearances since his 89th-minute substitute cameo in Croatia's World Cup place-clinching play-off victory over Iceland in November, has tasted victory only once (in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/11/southampton-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league\" title=\"\">last month's narrow home win over West Brom</a>). In 11 matches before the last international break – memorable for Saints fans also for seeing the England debuts of Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez – Southampton had conceded five goals at 0.45 goals per game, the best record in the league; in 16 since they have conceded 27 at 1.69 goals per game, better than only Cardiff, Fulham and (by one goal) Stoke. Saints sit six points from sixth; Lovren's return will be welcome, but it may not be enough. <strong>SB</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/26/luke-shaw-manchester-city-manchester-united-chelsea\" title=\"\">Manchester City join the battle to sign Southampton's Shaw</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>5) Matic now the main midfield man at Chelsea</h2><p></p><p>No doubt about the most significant January transfer towards the top of the table: Kim Kallst … sorry, Chelsea's decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/15/nemanja-matic-chelsea-midfield-jose-mourinho-benfica\" title=\"\">to swallow their pride and re-recruit Nemanja Matic</a> has proven so successful that the team already looks dependent on the powerful Serbian. His performances have been so imperious that one could easily have forgotten that Chelsea were suffering from a central midfield void for at least 18 months before his arrival, but the club were given a reminder of that as it re-emerged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/26/galatasaray-chelsea-champions-league\" title=\"\">in the second half at Galatasary on Wednesday</a>. Matic's absence from the Champions League is one of the chief reasons why Chelsea have only a miniscule chance of winning that tournament – but his availability for the Premier League is why Chelsea are likely to remain on top of it after this round of fixtures – featuring the Blues' derby at Fulham – and perhaps until the end of the campaign. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/chelsea-jose-mourinho-galatasaray\" title=\"\">Mourinho rues lack of Chelsea killer instinct at Galatasaray</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/samuel-etoo-chelsea-jose-mourinho-comments\" title=\"\">Eto'o says he can keep scoring for Chelsea 'until I am 50'</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>6) Clubs who got it right in January look set to be rewarded </h2><p></p><p>This season could yet be defined by who did the best business in January. Nikica Jelavic, like Shane Long, has begun his career at Hull City well, the pair injecting fresh pep and potency into the Tigers just as they were beginning to look vulnerable. Consequently, Hull now look likely to survive, a fate they would virtually secure with a victory at Newcastle, who have yet to come to terms with the loss of Yohan Cabaye. Similarly, Crystal Palace will go to Swansea intent on showing that the arrivals of Tom Ince and Joe Ledley, in particular, have given them the quality to stay afloat in the top flight. No team, of course, was more active in January than Fulham, but we have yet to see whether their shopping spree, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/20/fulham-felix-magath-five-things-save-from-relegation\" title=\"\">the subsequent appointment of Felix Magath</a>, has not come too late to atone for a couple of seasons of under-investment and misjudgements. An improbable win over Chelsea would be just the thing to ignite new belief at Craven Cottage. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/you-are-the-ref-paul-trevillion\" title=\"\">You are the Ref No277: starring Fulham boss Felix Magath</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>7) An intriguing Sherwood v Solskjaer match-up</h2><p></p><p>An interesting fixture this, featuring two teams already on their second manager of this campaign, neither of them whom seem a particularly good bet to be in charge when the next one begins. Trying to second-guess <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/28/vincent-tan-malky-mackay-luck-cardiff\" title=\"\">an owner as eccentric as Vincent Tan</a> is more pointless than a tea-time TV game show hosted by Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman, but considering his Norwegian manager has lost five and won just one of his seven Premier League matches in charge thus far, it's probably safe to assume the Malaysian was hoping for a slightly better return from the man he chose as Malky Mackay's replacement. While early defeats at the hands of West Ham, Manchester City and West Ham are excusable, the recent home drubbings at the hands of Hull City <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/08/swansea-city-cardiff-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">and their south Wales neighbours Swansea City</a> will have tried the patience of even the most long-suffering Cardiff City fans.</p><p></p><p>The fledgling career of Solskjaer's Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Tim Sherwood got off to a much better start, which is no big surprise considering the vastly superior squad he inherited from André Villas-Boas. Sherwood has <a href=\"http://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=2545\" title=\"\">overseen eight victories and five defeats in his 15 games in charge</a>, but the criticism of his lack of tactical nous has been lacerating. With Louis van Gaal, who will step down as Netherlands boss after the World Cup, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/23/louis-van-gaal-tottenham-manager-world-cup-holland\" title=\"\">having hinted that he has been approached by Tottenham with a view to taking over next season</a>, it seems that nothing short of a fourth-place finish will keep Sherwood in his current gig and even that might not be enough. The often over-the-top praise and ridicule heaped upon Solskjaer and Sherwood respectively, considering their respective records, suggests this is a straight match-up between a tactically astute manager with very average players and a tactically naive manager with much better ones. In truth it's far more nuanced than that, but this is a contest that both men desperately need to win and it will be intriguing to see how each of them goes about it. <strong>BG</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/28/vincent-tan-malky-mackay-luck-cardiff\" title=\"\">Tan puts Mackay's success down to luck, hits out at press</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/tottenham-hotspur-dnipro-dnipropetrovsk-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Adebayor stuns Dnipro in comeback Europa League win</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>8) The race for 12th intensifies at Villa Park</h2><p></p><p>The contest for 12th place is the hottest in the Premier League at the moment, three teams having taken 28 points from their 27 games, all of them with seven wins, seven draws and fully 13 defeats. All three play at 4.30pm on Sunday, and two face each other at Villa Park. \"It'll be very, very weird. It will be a strange game,\" says Grant Holt, although his emotions have been stirred less by a fleeting statistical coincidence and more by a first reunion with a side he played for with such distinction before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/16/grant-holt-aston-villa-wigan-loan\" title=\"\">a short-lived move to Wigan last summer</a>, though he may well watch the entire strange game from the bench, as he has Aston Villa's last two matches. Holt scored eight league goals for Norwich last season and 15 the year before that, a standard of prolificness that might not be particularly earth-shattering but remains a distant dream to those now attempting to fill his shirt – Gary Hooper has so far mustered five and the next most prolific member of Chris Hughton's notoriously somnambulant frontline is Ricky van Wolfswinkel on one. Holt, meanwhile, scored his second and, thus far, final goal of this league season in August. It could be that Holt now is to Norwich precisely what Norwich are to Holt: a reminder of thrilling highs that are now very much in the past. <strong>SB</strong></p><p></p><h2>9) A fitting time to return for Aluko</h2><p></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/21/newcastle-united-hull-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Hull won 3-2 at St James's Park in September</a>, having twice been behind, their victory was secured by a stunning volleyed winner from Sone Aluko, which sent Steve Bruce into an involuntary and somewhat humiliating touchline dance. \"I think he could light up the Premier League this year,\" Bruce later said of the goalscorer. \"If he stays fit and healthy, then I think we've got a really good player on our hands.\" He didn't, however, stay fit and healthy. A few weeks later Aluko suffered an achilles injury at Everton, and he has not started a league game since, an absence from the first XI now well into a fifth month. In recent weeks though he has been tentatively edging his way back to fitness with a series of brief substitute appearances, and he started both FA Cup fifth-round matches against Brighton. But this weekend's visit of Newcastle represents a fitting moment for the Nigerian, who turned 25 10 days ago, to return to the league side. Hull have got by pretty well without him – he got a good reminder of that from the Cardiff bench last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/22/cardiff-city-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">watching his side win 4-0</a> in the only match since his return to some semblance of fitness in which he has played no part – but Aluko had been one of their most impressive players in the opening weeks of the season, and could belatedly make good on Bruce's bullish predictions as the campaign winds towards its conclusion. <strong>SB</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/25/newcastle-united-make-profit-for-third-year-in-row\" title=\"\">Newcastle make profit for third year in a row</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/23/alan-pardew-newcastle-win-pressure\" title=\"\">Pardew hopes victory will ease 'miserable' media pressure</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>10) Suddenly smiley without Carroll, sad without Jelavic</h2><p></p><p>Funny how things work out. West Ham spent most of this season pining for the return of Andy Carroll, convinced that his reintegration to the team would solve their goalscoring problems and extricate them from trouble. Yet almost as soon as he came back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/07/andy-carroll-ban-stands-west-ham\" title=\"\">he was sidelined again </a>because of Swansea defender's Chico Flores' freakishly fragile face … and that's when West Ham embarked on their strongest run of the season. Now, after four wins in a row, they are safe and they go to Everton with the home side suddenly looking like the team who could do with Carroll. Or with Nikica Jelavic, whom they sold in January.

It being dark but for the street lamps, it wasn't until they came quite a lot closer that I started to notice the tell-tale signs. As they neared, the men were overtly looking me up and down, eyes lingering on my breasts and legs, before turning back to one another, saying something I couldn't hear, and sniggering. My heartbeat quickened, the hair rose on my arms, and I felt the usual emotions flood through me. Fear. Anxiety. Impotence. Anger. Frustration. Misplaced embarrassment and shame.</p><p>This is one of the things I think some men don't understand, the men who ask you what the big deal is about street harassment, say they'd love it if it happened to them, or suggest you just \"take it as a compliment\". It's not a simple, one-moment experience. It's a horribly drawn-out affair. The process of scanning the street as you walk; the constant alert tension; the moment of revelation and the sinking feeling as you realise what is going to happen. Countless women have written to me about the defence mechanisms they put in place – walking with keys between their knuckles just to feel safe – wearing their earphones so they can keep their head down and ignore it. The whole process of going out, particularly at night, can become fraught and difficult.</p><p>Why don't you just take it as a compliment?</p><p>Too late to cross the street, I braced myself for the moment of passing, muscles tensed, cold fists involuntarily clenched. I understand that this must sound like an overreaction. But it isn't. Because the way we think and behave is shaped by our previous experiences. Too many times, in my own experience, this situation has turned from leering to aggressive sexual advances, from polite rebuttal to angry shouts of 'slag', 'slut', 'whore'. Once, I was chased down the street. Once, I was trapped against a wall. Once, my crotch was grabbed suddenly, shockingly, in vitriolic entitlement. So yes, my muscles contracted and I drew into myself as they passed.</p><p>For a moment, they paused, and one glanced at my breasts before turning nonchalantly to the other. I was expecting the usual. \"Look at the tits on that\", or \"I wouldn't say no\". But what he actually said took my breath away:</p><p>\"I'd hold a knife to that.\"</p><p>The other man laughed, and they walked away without giving me a second glance.</p><p>And that, in a nutshell, is why I don't take it as a compliment. Because it's not a compliment. It's a statement of power. It's a way of letting me know that a man has the right to my body, a right to discuss it, analyse it, appraise it, and let me or anybody else in the vicinity know his verdict, whether I like it or not. It's a power that is used to intimidate and dehumanise members of the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LGBTQIA\" title=\"\">LGBTQIA</a> community, who suffer <a href=\"http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/eustudy/\" title=\"\">disproportionate levels of street harassment.</a> It's a \"right\" that extends even to the bodies of the 11- and 12-year–old girls who have written to the<a href=\" http://www.everydaysexism.com\" title=\"\"> Everyday Sexism Project </a>in their hundreds, describing shouted comments about their breasts and developing bodies as they walk in their uniform to school. Street harassment is no more about compliments than rape is about sex. Both are about power, violence and control. That's why, when women have the temerity to reject the advances of street harassers, they so often turn, in a moment, to angry outbursts of abuse. Because that rejection disrupts their entitlement to our bodies, which society has allowed them to believe is their inherent right.</p><p>This doesn't mean the end of compliments. It doesn't mean you can't flirt, or be attracted to a stranger, or make a polite approach and strike up a conversation. Those are all completely different things from commentary about your body that is directed at you, not to you, the dehumanised discussion of your parts by a group of passers-by, not caring that you can hear, or a scream of \"sexy\" or \"slut\" or \"pussy\". Those aren't compliments. They're something else. I believe that the vast majority of people know the difference. If you're really not sure, err on the side of caution.</p><p>This is not to suggest that every woman is a cowering victim, or that we're all too scared to go about our business on a daily basis. Just that it would be nice if those people who think street harassment is \"just a compliment\" recognised the very real and enormous impact it has on victim's lives – not just in the moment, but day-in, day-out. A compliment doesn't make you rethink your route the next time you walk down the street. Many women, including <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10634125/Sex-attack-on-Tube-Why-I-grabbed-the-man-who-sexually-assaulted-me-on-the-train.html\" title=\"\">Doris Chen</a>, who grabbed hold of a man on the underground after he ejaculated on her, have bravely confronted their harassers. But the point is that they shouldn't have to. Nobody knows how they will react in that situation until it happens. Often, victims report feeling frozen with shock. Sometimes it isn't safe to respond. Instead of telling victims how to react, we should focus on preventing it from happening in the first place.

Simmons c Ali b Bresnan 65 (West Indies 153-5)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>England finally break this partnership, off the penultimate ball of the powerplay, as Simmons skews the ball in the air and Ali rushes forward to take a low, tumbling, one-handed catch.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310b44ee4b0c95feebdd4a3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T16:11:30.785Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">39th over: West Indies 148-4 (Simmons 62, Dwayne Bravo 36)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Broad brings himself back, and is proper furious with himself when a poor delivery is punished by Simmons, who scoops it over point for four. “Afternoon Simon, afternoon everybody.” Afternoon, Guy Hornsby. “Decent bowling performance here from England. That’ll be an undoubted kiss of death I bet. Speaking of cheese puns, there’s a shout for Gordon Gruyerenich, John Em-brie, Steve Finn (the surname, check it), Goudan Greenwich, Ricotta Ponting, Dmitri Macsarponas.

Jordan has been responsible for 80% of England’s five wides, and is the only bowler going for more than five an over. Anyway, I interrupted Josh Robinson. “This isn’t a cheese pun, I’m afraid. Can I be the first to say that on England’s recent form I reckon the West Indies are safe by now?” You may indeed. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310b151e4b01bd15abf32e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T16:01:27.871Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">37th over: West Indies 129-4 (Simmons 51, Dwayne Bravo 30)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>You see, I made the mistake of trying to get a drink in the drinks break, and as a result John Ashdown, warming up next to me before he takes over for the second innings, has to watch the first half-over for me. Bravo takes a single off the first, and then off the second Simmons rocks back and carts Ali through the covers for four. A couple more runs and he’s not only reached his half-century, but he’s helped his side score 10 runs off the over, their most profitable of the day.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310b059e4b04289b0526add\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:54:54.500Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">36th over: West Indies 119-4 (Simmons 43, Dwayne Bravo 28)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Bravo attempts a cover drive, and pulls off a pretty good one, but Broad dives to his left and collects the ball. Bravo does work the next delivery wide of Broad, though with a lot less power. Broad sprints away, dives to stop the ball and flicks it back to the supporting Tredwell – but wide of him, gifting West Indies the chance to take a bonus run. Jordan’s over brings seven runs in all, and after all that excitement they obviously need a drink. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310af47e4b0c95feebdd4a0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:50:41.064Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">35th over: West Indies 112-4 (Simmons 41, Dwayne Bravo 23)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>At the moment England aren’t taking wickets, West Indies aren’t scoring runs, and Sky keep showing pictures of people cooking chicken. These are bad days to be an OBOer, and I’ve idiotically wasted the whole cheesy cricketers thing on the early stages of this match when adrenalin and natural exuberance would probably have kept me going.

Three important singles, though, because they bring up 100 runs for West Indies. Still more cheese, with Peter Inness proposing Geoff Boyricotta. Incidentally, I’ve ignored anyone replacing Bert with Camembert, because they don’t sound the same so it doesn’t read right.

Four runs, four entire runs, scored off a single delivery, by hitting the ball across the boundary rope! Incredible scenes in Antigua! Also two wides and a few other odds, sods and prods, and that’s an eight-run over, the most expensive since over eight.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a90de4b01bd15abf32d9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:23:31.000Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">29th over: West Indies 79-4 (Simmons 25, Dwayne Bravo 10)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Tredwell’s final over brings another couple of singles, and he departs, his 10 over bowled, having taken one wicket and conceded just 23 runs.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a845e4b041a824813136\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:19:39.268Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">28th over: West Indies 77-4 (Simmons 24, Dwayne Bravo 9)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Dwayne Bravo rises onto his toes and swings his bat violently, and the crowd squeals, literally squeals, with anticipation. But his timing isn’t great, and there’s no run. There is also no run from any of the other deliveries in Jordan’s over. Meanwhile, a good cheesy offering from Mark Hammond Giles: Terry Aldermanchego.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a796e4b041a824813135\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:16:19.104Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">27th over: West Indies 77-4 (Simmons 24, Dwayne Bravo 9)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Two more singles. Sky really have a problem with their microphones here, with a lot of idle background chit-chat being picked up and broadcast to the world. Tredwell’s nine overs have gone at the rate of 2.33 each, and this is all set to be his best ODI performance ever. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a6cee4b04289b0526acb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:13:24.648Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">26th over: West Indies 74-4 (Simmons 23, Dwayne Bravo 8)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>“Simon, has anyone else commented on the horrible colour clash of the two teams’ outfits?” wonders Richard Thomson, as Jordan continues bowling. No, they haven’t. “Maybe they could all play in white?” Hmm, that’s just the kind of novel, forward-thinking idea that cricket might be ready for in a decade or two.<br></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a5fee4b01bd15abf32d5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:10:04.154Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">25th over: West Indies 73-4 (Simmons 23, Dwayne Bravo 8)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>They’re going very much run crazy in Antigua right now. For those who have forgotten what a boundary is, there was one in over 17. “It’s an ugly mouthful, like the cheese, but I’m pretty sure it works, Malcolmmental Marshall?” proffers Daniel Montefusco. I’d have taken Malcomté Marshall, but not that one.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a51ce4b04289b0526ac5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:06:35.781Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">24th over: West Indies 69-4 (Simmons 20, Dwayne Bravo 7)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Now Chris Jordan takes the ball, and his first delivery is driven by Simmons past point for three. Three runs, off a single delivery. And there’s still time for Bravo to hit another two. Incredible scenes. In the background, just about off-mic, Bumble starts swearing. “I smashed by knee on this table here, and let out an expletive that I hope you didn’t hear,” he explains. Yup, good luck with that. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a43ae4b041a824813131\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T15:02:06.820Z\">3.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">23rd over: West Indies 64-4 (Simmons 17, Dwayne Bravo 5)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>England are bowling with impressive discipline, but nobody seems to be trying very hard to score runs.

Two singles. “Can we get away from bad puns and get back to the game?” pleads Felix Wood. “I’d say that if the Windies lose another couple of wickets an England victory would be feta ccompli.”</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5310a2bee4b0c95feebdd48e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T14:55:19.556Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">21st over: West Indies 60-4 (Simmons 15, Dwayne Bravo 3)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Tredwell continues, as do the Windies’ travails.

With England’s full-time ODI captain Alastair Cook getting some much-needed rest, Kevin Pietersen manning his Twitter account on a full-time basis and Chris Gayle currently absent through injury, some might look at today’s line-up much like an audience member at a Bucks Fizz concert, wondering who that unfamiliar bunch on the stage could be and where the hell Cheryl Baker and Mike Nolan have got to. </p><p>There remains some doubt about whether, given the upcoming World Twenty20 and the number of very-limited-over specialists in the touring party, these ODIs will be approached as ODIs or as extended, 12” remix-style Twenty20s. The most likely answer is that they will be approached as ODIs in which anyone getting out to a ludicrous overambitious shot has a vaguely credible excuse for trying it out.<br></p><p>Incidentally, I love the way the intro to this Bucks Fizz show takes the audience through all the reasons why they shouldn’t expect to recognise anyone who’s about to take the stage. Don’t worry,  you can stop it before you actually have to hear them sing. If I were sitting in the crowd that night the immediate message I’d have taken from the video would have been: “Run for the sun, little one.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnITCDUjA0c\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnITCDUjA0c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53107c3ae4b01bd15abf329d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-28T12:30:12.846Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Simon will be from 1pm GMT with new of the teams and the toss as England take on the West Indies in the first ODI of the series in the Caribbean.

Again, Pietersen could not help himself, tweeting “neither is The Big Cheese Prior!” – a reference to the nickname the wicketkeeper has held, and apparently relished, in the England dressing room since his brash early days.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/28/kevin-pietersen-twitter-matt-prior-big-cheese\">Read the full story here.</a></p> </div> </div>","headline":"West Indies v England – live!","trailText":"<b>Over-by-over report:</b> Can England put their a turbulent few months behind them against the West Indies?

However, now other rail users will be able to buy the new \"Two Together\" card which gives discounts for people aged 26-59 travelling together.</p><p></p><p>The Association of Train Operating Companies, which manages railcards and National Rail Enquiries, says the new railcard will give one-third off the cost of most rail tickets – but only if the two people named on the card travel together. The card will cost £30 a year and goes on sale at 9am on Monday 3 March.</p><p></p><p>People who buy the card will get one-third off many Standard and First Class Anytime, Off-Peak, Super Off-Peak and Advance fares, across the national rail network. The card also includes airport express services, and ferry-inclusive journeys such as trips to or from the Isle of Wight.</p><p></p><p>But the new Two Together discounted tickets are not available to be used between 4.30am and 9.30am on Mondays to Fridays. There are no restrictions on weekend trips.</p><p></p><p>Users must both be aged over 16. Forms will be available at a staffed stations, or online at <a href=\"http://twotogether-railcard.co.uk/\" title=\"\">twotogether-railcard.co.uk</a> – for which you will need a digital passport photo of each person.</p><p></p><p>The discount applies only when both of you travel together. Any variation – such as only one of you making the return journey – renders the discounted tickets invalid. Depending on the policy of the train operator, you could be liable to pay the full Anytime fare or a penalty fare.</p><p></p><p>There is nothing to stop regular business users who travel with colleagues from using the card if their journey is after 9.30am. Equally, some passengers will want to buy more than one card so they can pair up with different people. Off-peak commuters need to find others who share the same trains, and join forces.</p><p></p><p>Those making long-distance journeys could save the £30 card's cost in one journey. A standard London-Birmingham off-peak round trip costs £50.50 per person on Virgin Trains, or £101 for two. The Two Together fare, plus the cost of a brand-new railcard, totals £96.70.</p>","headline":"New couples railcard gives a third off train fares for 26 to 59-year-olds","trailText":"Couples travelling

music","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-27T14:37:00Z","sectionName":"Music","sectionId":"music","id":"music/musicblog/2014/feb/27/female-masturbation-pop-miley-cyrus-music-video","fields":{"hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Annie Clark, aka St Vincent, surprised fans last December with a new single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5BhXdVBqw\" title=\"\">Birth in Reverse</a>, which featured the line: \"Oh what an ordinary day, take out the garbage, masturbate.\" Shortly thereafter, a salacious video for Miley Cyrus's Adore materialised, in which the singer runs a sly hand down her body to signify that she too will procure her own pleasure – a routine she's also decided to play up on <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/02/20/parents-want-cyrus-tour-stopped\" title=\"\">her current Bangerz tour</a>. Not long after Adore appeared online, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg1tO7yQ0dE\" title=\"\">Nicki Minaj sneaked up on fans by releasing</a> a remix of the song Boss Ass Bitch and from it sprung the words: \"It's a holiday, playing with my pussy day.\" Most recently, on Valentine's Day, Minaj said on her new single Lookin Ass N*gga that she has no use for unworthy men. In none of these instances is masturbation presented as titillating, prurient or provocative. It is normal and routine.</p><p>In a carnally confident style akin to Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein yowling through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtSxrViNKI&amp;feature=kp\" title=\"\">Sleater-Kinney's Let's Call It Love</a>, or PJ Harvey lasciviously panting, \"Lick my legs! I'm on fire!\" on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzwG3r9_L9o\" title=\"\">Rid of Me</a>, female pleasure in popular music is making a libertine – albeit cooler-headed – return. When female rappers and R&amp;B icons of the 90s and early 00s used this method (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb37Nh_Sg4g&amp;feature=kp\" title=\"\">Tweet's Oops Oh My</a>, Janet Jackson's Take Care and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5clkFgVhmj4\" title=\"\">Lil' Kim's Queen Bitch</a> to name a smutty few), it was a powerful tool which pushed back on the idea that women needed men. But in 2014, the shock value of a woman masturbating – at least as a lyrical device – has at last begun to depreciate. It is no longer an act of flirty deviance to be monetised; it is merely normalised. Sure, Cyrus almost certainly knew the Adore You video would spark a prudish outcry, but it's still the least flashy thing she's done of late. Similar is the <a href=\"http://content.clearchannel.com/cc-common/mlib/1767/05/1767_1368787642.jpg\" title=\"\">\"DIY\" T-shirt Rihanna sported last May</a>, which showed a woman masturbating. With it Rihanna wore a long skirt and a toque. If the point was to be seen, it was also: \"And so what?\"</p><p>While female pleasure in music is nothing new, the shift that has appeared is largely based around an absence of the man: take for example Janet Jackson's Take Care, where she sings: \"I'll lay here and take care of it 'til you come home to me.\" For Jackson, masturbation is a bookmark. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-34w8kGPM&amp;feature=kp\" title=\"\">The Divinyls' I Touch Myself</a> – a pro-masturbation anthem if ever there was one – contains the line: \"I'd get down on my knees, I'd do anything for you.\" When it came out in 1990 it was intrepid. But the song is just as much about giving pleasure as getting it.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5BhXdVBqw\">Reading on mobile? See St Vincent's Birth in Reverse video here</a></p><p>In a 2011 interview with CNN, Kathleen Hanna, feminist leader of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/14/kathleen-hanna-julie-ruin-riot-grrrl\" title=\"\">Bikini Kill</a> and now the Julie Ruin, questioned the purpose of Katy Perry's sexual presentation on Perry's 2008 debut single <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/katy-perry-prism-review\" title=\"\">I Kissed a Girl</a>. \"The whole thing is like, 'I kissed a girl so my boyfriend could masturbate about it later,' said Hanna. \"It's disgusting. It's exactly every male fantasy of fake lesbian porn.\"</p><p>Considered alongside a line from the new essay collection by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Is It My Body? – \"The body's not theirs anymore,\" she writes of rock stars. \"It's a public domain and public perception\" – the discussion over whom a woman's pleasure serves seems more relevant than ever. A handful of casual references in which pleasure is one's own are slickly antithetical to any male musician – from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3Fa4lOQfbA\" title=\"\">Serge Gainsbourg</a> to Skinny Puppy – who ever plunked the sound of a woman moaning into a song for the sake of masculine bravado.</p><p>Additionally, the dust finally settling on female masturbation makes room for some gloriously guileful subversion. On <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I9naW9okaE\" title=\"\">Backseat Freestyle, Angel Haze</a> reverses the double standard by laughing pitifully at the male who goes home alone – \"Just keep on masturbating,\" she says. After that she avows, \"Poppin' pussy's irrelevant.\" This is not dissimilar to Lil' Kim's \"a lot of napkins\" dig in the opening track of her 1996 debut album Hard Core.</p><p>St Vincent, Cyrus and Minaj don't fight for the right to pleasure, they just do it and they do it themselves. Until this point, most lyrics on the subject of female masturbation have undermined and corrected the illusion that pleasure can't be DIY. Now the message is that pleasure still exists when pleasure is self-serving.</p>","headline":"Female masturbation comes into its own in pop music","trailText":"<p>Women pleasuring themselves in pop

Together with landowner David Lawrence, he installed three motion sensor cameras along a 400-500m stretch of the river. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-25822883\" title=\"\">A lone beaver was spotted</a> on the farm in January and last July a woman claimed she saw a beaver on the river.</p><p>\"We'd seen bits of trees chewed and cut down and I was starting to think that it was a sign of beavers even though I couldn't believe it,\" Buckley said.</p><p>Beaver expert Derek Gow confirmed that one of the animals filmed by Buckley was a juvenile and the family may have been in the wild for years. Buckley does not know where they have come from or exactly where their home is.</p><p>\"When I first saw that first beaver it was such a shock. When I saw three it was slightly different – we knew there was one around and we were tracking its activities. When we watched film and all of a sudden another appeared, and then another – I would not just say that was amazing – one was speechless realising what was happening. We had no idea there was more than one, and they are all quite large and active as well.\"</p><p>Devon Wildlife Trust has been running its own Beaver Project since 2011, when an adult male and female were introduced to a securely fenced compound in the north-west of the county.</p><p>But the beavers remain in their compound and are not the source of the population now seen on the River Otter.</p><p>Steve Hussey from the Devon Wildlife Trust said he supported the reintroduction of beavers to England but that it had to be \"properly planned\".</p><p>\"In principle, we would like to see the European beaver reintroduced to England but recognise that a great deal of work needs to be done before this can happen.\"</p><p>He said the beavers should be left alone and observed using a rigorous monitoring programme.</p><p>\"This group of beavers provides us with a unique opportunity to learn lessons about their behaviour and their impact on the local landscape … [the group] could contribute to this process if they are subjected to thorough scientific study.</p><p>Beavers are a \"keystone species\", meaning they provide more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/jun/06/challenge-agricultural-hegemony\" title=\"\">important ecosystem services</a> than their numbers alone would suggest. Known as \"ecological engineers\", their dams, burrows and ditches and the branches they drag into the water create habitats for a host of other species. Their dams slow rivers down, reducing scouring and erosion, and improving water quality by holding back silt.</p><p>During the recent wet weather and flooding crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/29/beavers-dam-flooding-owen-paterson\" title=\"\">naturalists called for the reintroduction of beavers to control floods</a>.</p><p>Otter tracks and spraint was found alongside the beaver prints, indicating they may have been interacting with wild otters too.</p><p>Hussey added: \"There's evidence that otters, beavers are coming together here face to face perhaps for the first time in two or 300 years.\"</p><p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is investigating the sighting as it is against the law to release beavers in England. A spokeswoman said the department would \"look into this case and will consider what action to take\".</p><p>She said she could not comment on whether the beavers could be removed from the site or destroyed.</p><p>Buckley said: \"This beaver family has been around for at least a couple of years and no one seems to have noticed them. They haven't caused any trouble for anybody and it's only because they've been caught on camera that people know they are here. To think about destroying them is totally out of order. This is an insight into what the potential impact is if they are already in a place and at the moment that impact would seem to be zero.\"</p>","headline":"Wild beavers seen in England for first time

At issue is whether he intended to kill her, which could see him jailed for at least 25 years or, as he contends, mistook her for an intruder and fired four times in self-defence through a locked toilet door.</p><p>During the trial Pistorius, 27, will call on at least four forensic scientists, and has hired a US forensic animation firm to digitally recreate the crime scene. He is understood to be funding his own defence without input from his family.</p><p>But while the prosecution and defence trade blows in a case that could last months, another trial will be taking place simultaneously: that of South African criminal justice. \"This far exceeds any other court cases in terms of hype and media attention,\" said Mandy Wiener, a journalist and author of <a href=\"http://panmacmillan.bookslive.co.za/blog/2013/03/18/mandy-wiener-and-barry-bateman-to-write-behind-the-door-the-oscar-and-reeva-story\" title=\"\">Behind the Door: The Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp Story</a>, one of several books about the case already in the pipeline. \"It will certainly put the South African criminal justice system under the spotlight like no other case has done before.\"</p><p>Although there is no jury and the innocence or guilt of Pistorius – known as Blade Runner because of the prosthetics he uses to compete in athletics – will be determined by Judge Thokozile Masipa with the help of two assessors, there are still fears that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/16/reeva-steenkamp-shooting\" title=\"\">OJ Simpson-style circus </a> could jeopardise his chances of receiving a fair trial. Pistorius's defence raised such concerns this week when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/25/oscar-pistorius-trial-broadcast-live-tv-south-africa\" title=\"\">argued for a broadcasting blackout in court</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430982058'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/25/1393342629060/Oscar-Pistorius-010.jpg' alt='Oscar Pistorius' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oscar Pistorius in court in June last year. Photograph: Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Despite ruling that the trial could be covered live on radio, and parts of it on TV, Judge Dunstan Mlambo said he was aware of plans for round-the-clock TV coverage and warned: \"The so-called trial by media inclinations cannot be in the interest of justice as required in this matter and have the potential to seriously undermine the court proceedings that will soon start.\"</p><p>Others share his concerns. William Booth, a defence lawyer, said: \"The fact we have so much pre-publicity and commentary from experts means we will start pre-judging the case. Many judges tell me that they read newspapers, watch TV and listen to the radio. They have friends who ask them about cases. I know my friends ask me about cases I'm working on.</p><p>\"Although they have legal training and are supposed to be objective, judges are human and we have never had a situation like this before. It's crazy, hyped up media pressure and I think the judge and the assessors could be influenced.\"</p><p>But media experts disagree. <a href=\"http://www.theharbinger.co.za\" title=\"\">Anton Harber</a>,  director of journalism and media studies at Wits University in Johannesburg, said: \"I think the danger of coverage threatening the fairness of the trial is easily exaggerated, especially without a jury. It is speculative and unquantifiable, whereas the positive side of open justice is more real and tangible.</p><p>\"Pistorius will have the best legal minds defending him, a media team watching his back, and the justice system will be on its best behaviour, under the spotlight. We all know that is not typical of our courts, so he is more fortunate than most accused.\"</p><p>There was evidence of Team Pistorius at work this week with the launch of a Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OscarHardTruth\" title=\"\">@OscarHardTruth</a>, with the strapline \"Truth Shall Prevail. Innocent until Proven Guilty\". By Thursday night it had more than 25,000 followers.</p><p>It is not only the frenzy of tweeting and punditry that will put South African justice under scrutiny. One of the key questions to be tested in court is whether police tainted the crime scene at the start of their investigation. During last year's bail hearing, then lead detective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/oscar-pistorius-case-lead-detective-removed\" title=\"\">Hilton Botha wilted under questioning</a>, conceding that he had entered Pistorius's home without the correct protective footwear, lost track of ammunition at the scene and made several false assumptions. This comes against a backdrop of cases of incompetence, corruption and brutality among the South African police.</p><p>The case has also stirred <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/world/africa/south-africans-debate-meaning-of-reeva-steenkamps-death.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">commentary on two perennial South African themes</a>.   Those who believe Pistorius is guilty point to the country's high rate of domestic violence against women. Those who think him innocent but trigger-happy highlight the fear of crime, often with a racial dimension, that drives some to live in guarded gated communities. \"The man dubbed as the Blade Runner has articulated, to the point of triteness, the most popularly espoused <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2013-02-22-00-pistorius-south-africa-bears-and-breeds-these-men\" title=\"\">white, middle-class South African paranoia</a>,\" journalist Niren Tolsi wrote in the Mail and Guardian newspaper last year.</p><p>Yet attempts to grasp at wider meanings are likely to fall by the wayside on Monday when the theatricality of \"the trial of the century\" takes over. Stepping into the dock in Pretoria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/steenkamp-family-greenbushes-oscar-pistorius-trial\" title=\"\">Pistorius will come face to face with Steenkamp's mother, June</a>,  for the first time since the shooting. Steenkamp's father, Barry, reported to have had a major stroke, will not be in court.</p><p>Her uncle, Mike Steenkamp, said this week: \"They're taking every day as it comes until the trial date. It will be a form of closure, some stage of closure for them. With the justice system it all depends on the case, and with this type of case the system should be working. Let justice take its course.\"</p>","headline":"Oscar Pistorius: will one of most hyped murder trials in history be fair?","trailText":"As an international media circus gathers and rolling TV coverage is planned, the frenzy of tweeting and commentary will put South Africa's justice system under close scrutiny","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n6e2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393587768620/Oscar-Pistorius-on-track--004.jpg","wordcount":"1017","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial-fair-begins-south-africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/28/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial-fair-begins-south-africa","tags":[{"id":"world/reeva-steenkamp-shooting","webTitle":"Reeva Steenkamp shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/reeva-steenkamp-shooting","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/reeva-steenkamp-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"sport/oscar-pistorius","webTitle":"Oscar Pistorius","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/oscar-pistorius","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/oscar-pistorius","references":[]},{"id":"world/southafrica","webTitle":"South Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/southafrica","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidsmith","webTitle":"David Smith","rcsId":"GNL508721","r2ContributorId":"15571","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331034359272/David_Smith.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Smith is the Guardian's Africa correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidsmith","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430982055","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393587762924/Oscar-Pistorius-on-track--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Diego Azubel","altText":"Oscar Pistorius on track at London Olympics, hands together as if in prayer, he looks at scoreboard","height":"54","credit":"Diego Azubel/EPA","caption":"Oscar Pistorius at the  London 2012 Olympics.

A&nbsp;month before, Farmfoods announced its almost 44% year-on-year growth, <a href=\"http://www.kantarworldpanel.com\" title=\"\">Kantar Worldpanel statistics</a> showed general frozen food sales grew 2.5% in the year from December 2012. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/feb/10/frozen-food-sales\" title=\"\">frozen v fresh debate</a> is right back on the agenda.</p><p>While the Kantar statistics assert that frozen meat, poultry and vegetables showed particular \"resilience\", there's one inescapable truth when it comes to frozen food – it's a realm taking in an awful lot of disparate, dubious products. </p><p>The statistics speak in broad terms, so it's hard to know whether the success is down to sales of podded edamame beans and forest fruit smoothie mixes or ready-made doner kebabs and omelette wedges, but one thing for certain is that Farmfoods is doing something right. Its brand strategy of Len Goodman ambassadorship plus mix-and-match deals – downright astonishing (or worrying, depending on your viewpoint) offers such as 12 salmon fillets, 3kg of chicken or 24 pork chops for £10 – is striking a chord with consumers.</p><p>It comes after a rollercoaster few years for frozen food, from high profile campaigns from the likes of Iceland involving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/18/kerry-katona-iceland\" title=\"\">Kerry Katona</a>, recalled food, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/08/fsa-tests-horsemeat-lasagne?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">Findus lasagnes</a>, to the industry's nightmare scenario, the horsemeat scandal. </p><p>However, after clever marketing, a Lidl and Aldi-fuelled demand for budget products and endorsement from chefs, the sector has already bounced back. And there are now upscale versions of Iceland to be found, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.cookfood.net/info/About-cook/\">Cook, (its tagline \"remarkable food for your freezer\"</a>) a company that so far has had 60 shops pop up around the country, charging £18 for four-portion beef dishes it says are from high quality cuts.</p><p>But for the most part, the industry's PR spiel hammers home the budget and waste-free credentials of frozen food. Most of the major specialist retailers, from Iceland to Heron Foods, are aimed at the cost-conscious buyer – and trumpet the \"locked-in freshness\" of frozen products alongside imagery of allotments, rolling green fields and bobbing fishing boats.</p><p>But while it's easy to be sceptical of this, it's no false claim that frozen food is as nutritionally beneficial as fresh. When it comes to frozen vegetables and fruit, they count towards your five-a-day just as effectively, with the British Nutrition Foundation <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/healthyeating/budget\" title=\"\">recommending frozen products</a>. Some even say that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/11/frozen-raspberries-good-for-you\" title=\"\">frozen berries actually benefit flavour-wise from the freezing process</a>. Other interested parties, namely <a href=\"http://bfff.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/A-Case-For-Frozen.pdf\" title=\"\">the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), say frozen sprouts, carrots and broccoli actually contain more antioxidants (pdf)</a> than their fresh equivalents.</p><p>Among the wilder claims made by frozen crusaders are that these products keep languishing pubs alive due to the healthy profit margins, actually help save the environment as freezing native produce involves less air travel and CO2 emissions, and also that they're a lifeline for the demands of mass catering, in schools and hospitals for instance.</p><p>Celebrity endorsement has also seen a U-turn. Six years ago Delia Smith was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/23/books.news\" title=\"\">lampooned for recommending frozen mash</a> and, more recently, Gordon Ramsay's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/heat-of-the-kitchen-proves-too-much-for-ramsay-1839294.html\" title=\"\">reputation was dented over frozen ready meals</a>. But modern austerity cooks insist that frozen products are perfectly valid ingredients – poverty campaigner and cookbook author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/05/jack-monroe-how-to-save-money-food-shopping-budget\" title=\"\">Jack Monroe loves frozen broccoli, spinach and green beans</a>, while Jamie Oliver has long championed frozen food (although we should note that he has <a href=\"http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Business-News/Jamie-Oliver-helps-boost-frozen-food-sales-by-250M\" title=\"\">promoted Young's frozen fish since 2011</a>).</p><p>Most home and professional freezers contain universally beloved frozen peas, thrifty frozen berries are ideal if you're going to be cooking them anyway, in a crumble or sauce. Frozen broad beans, pastry blocks and white fish can be used to great effect too, and, let's face it, there's a time and place for fish fingers, potato waffles and mini kievs (there, I said it). And while there is still some cynicism (snobbery?) around frozen food, not to mention debate over the <a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/nutrition_news_information/fresh_vs_frozen_vegetables_are_we_giving_up_nutrition_fo\" title=\"\">\"nutrition-obliterating\" flash-freezing processes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/14/1\" title=\"\">environmental costs</a>, the industry is unfazed.</p><p>Retail journalist Thomas Hobbs from <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk\" title=\"\">industry magazine The Grocer</a> says that while frozen food does still suffer an image problem, \"budget lines are being embraced by the middle classes\". He also attributes the success of Farmfoods to the fact that \"their product range is quite basic, but they have not over-diversified or compromised on their core strength – selling frozen foods – and that has worked in their favour.\"</p><p>Along with this no-nonsense, no-frills approach, recently there's been some creativity in the aisles, from Iceland's <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fmcg/iceland-launches-im-a-celebrity-bushtucker-trial-game/350929.article\" title=\"\">I'm a Celebrity frozen board game</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/social-media-marketing-mashtags\" title=\"\">Birds Eye \"Mashtags'</a>, designed for the Twitter generation.</p><p>Brian Young of the BFFF says moving upmarket may help the frozen market further, telling us in recent years there's been a rise in \"premium frozen product development, such as frozen herbs and risotto mixes\", but it remains to be seen whether this will convince the sceptics and see frozen food fully embraced as tantamount to fresh.</p><p>What's your take on frozen food?

David Rudisha</h2><p>Beauty is a subjective impression, but after a point, it becomes objective fact. John Steinbeck's writing, Mozart's music, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcyyRjFY6_g\" title=\"\">Etta James' singing</a>; beautiful. Similarly, anyone claiming indifference towards the Taj Mahal, Mona Lisa or Sagrada Família is most likely seeking attention because of the spectacular manner in which they capture aspects that somehow please our senses and soul: symmetry, cleanness, curvature and flow.</p><p>And David Rudisha is their athletic equivalent; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKEOjWEzVGs\" title=\"\">to watch him run is to understand perfection</a>, a genre of beauty characterised by its natural, effortless expression. \"I first saw him in primary school, I saw him running,\" recalls his coach, Brother Colm O'Connell. \"I saw his physical size, I saw his stride pattern, I saw his relaxation … you know, not stressed, not really flailing, somebody who was running in a controlled way.\" So it makes sense that the skill that validates his talent was imperceptibly learned as a kid chasing cattle barefoot. \"You have a nice feeling with the ground,\" Rudisha explains.</p><p>The upshot is a rhythmic, hypnotic form, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVcBJ4C6V0\" title=\"\">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a> on loop but without the earworm. His strides are tall, long and bouncy, arms somehow both angular and ergonomic, torso straight, head still; everything right, everything in its right place. Beautiful if you break it down, beautiful if you leave it for your instinct to assess.</p><p>But Rudisha is also special because he is so much more than an aesthetic, the definition of what the <a href=\"http://www.juf.org/jewish_learning/glossary_entry.aspx?id=7896\" title=\"\">Talmud calls tachlis</a>. In 2010, he broke Wilson Kipketer's 13-year-old 800m world record – and within a week had done it again. Then, in the trials for the London Olympics – at altitude in Nairobi – he ran the 14th fastest race in history, describing it as \"nice and easy\", before setting another all-time best at the Games, the faultlessness of his action rendering it impervious to pressure.</p><p>Occasionally, you see a particular person doing a particular thing and even if you know little about it or its mechanics, it is still clear that this is exactly how it's meant to be done; think <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8o6fudihvQ\" title=\"\">Stefan Edberg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsVU91Hyu4\" title=\"\">Ernie Els</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkMAf0ZHO_k&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">Roy Jones Jnr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IQ-UGwZdKM\" title=\"\">Michael Holding</a>. But although all four are of harmonic, symphonic quality, this classical beauty is defined by simplicity and in that regard Rudisha glides alone.</p><p>Athletically, his most obvious comparators are Usain Bolt and Carl Lewis. Bolt, though, is not exactly beautiful per se, more so because he's brilliant. Which is not to say that the two concepts are unrelated – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwylRw6Q_oI\" title=\"\">when Ryan Giggs scored the goal that really made his name</a>, a stunned Barry Davies found himself portmanteauing \"brilliaful!\" in commentary.</p><p>Lewis, on the other hand, hovered across the track in traditionally pleasing manner but his beauty is forever compromised <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbeb6qB6KPo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=37m22s\" title=\"\">by the money shot</a> in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbeb6qB6KPo\" title=\"\">Daniel Gordon's 9.79 documentary</a>. And this, along with an arrogant, entitled demeanour, makes him very different from Rudisha, whose gentle, friendly air is that of a man entirely comfortable in his skin, in the least threatening way imaginable.</p><p>And this helps; the allure of Rudisha isn't simply that of the human body doing exactly what it is meant to do, to its maximum capacity but that of a particular human being doing exactly what he is meant to do, to his maximum capacity. Because what really marks beauty as beauty isn't compliance with aesthetic rules but that it compels us to feel and experience intensity. And watching David Rudisha run is a moving, numinous thing, a man in absolute mastery of himself and his self.</p><h2>2) Justine Henin's backhand</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430983049'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393590651893/Justine-Henin-008.jpg' alt='Justine Henin' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Justine Henin winds up for her trademark backhand at Wimbledon in 2007. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Although Rudisha is classically beautiful – stereotypically, almost – there are other varieties that are enhanced by their idiosyncrasies. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0GmkkLOsA4\" title=\"\">Justine Henin's backhand</a>, say – for a while, the most devastating, fascinating shot in tennis – and this in the era of Rafael Nadal's forehand and Roger Federer's everything.</p><p>Most commonly, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdDwMj3_WMA\" title=\"\">it was delivered with topspin</a>, take-back steadied by left hand, followed by an arcing, whipping, smooth stroke with the right – and it really was a stroke, only one generated with supersonic whip and snapping wrist – then finished with a steepling flourish. And Henin was equally deadly staying low to hit flatter, long or dropped and with or without slice, eye, body and ball aligned like a sniper. Very few players have ever run around their forehand, fewer still who hit that shot as well as she did – but still, she had no reason not to.</p><p>Henin describes herself as \"very intense person\" and made no effort to hide that on court. When illness forced her to abandon tennis for a while, she took up skydiving to replace the missing adrenaline and quickly became obsessed. So, on winning at Roland Garros in 2006 – one of two consecutive French Opens won without losing a set, part of 40 consecutive sets won, in the process of winning three consecutive titles – she celebrated the following day by jumping out of a plane.</p><p>That year, she reached all four grand slam finals, controversially retiring hurt in Australia, no longer able to the bear the pain with which she had begun the match. But rather than applaud her bravery in playing it nonetheless, many seized umbrage because it was nearly over. \"What people think about me, I don't care too much about this,\" was her verdict. \"You don't live with regrets, what happened happened.\"</p><p>Even so, it was still a surprise when, after picking up two more majors in 2007, she retired in 2009 – still ranked No1 in the world but exhausted by the relentless experience of being her. And all of this – desire, focus, individuality and indignance – was captured in the artistry of her backhand.</p><p>Seeing her play the shot for the first time, the principal beauty is in the shock – the eff was that! – and subsequently, the incongruity, like encountering an enormous man with a very high voice. But although she appears fragile with narrow forearms and a slight torso, closer inspection reveals triceps and calves that could strangle crocodiles. Even so, though, its source remains something of a mystery, bringing with it a beauty of its own – as with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKMTSDzU1Z4\" title=\"\">earthquake lights</a> or Milady off Dogtanian – and the romantic aspect of a small person outbigging big people.</p><p>And there's also something especially aesthetic about backhands, by their nature more lithe and refined than a forehand; not for nothing was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_34nkKIUXc\" title=\"\">Miroslav Mecir, owner of another famous one</a>, known as The Big Cat, and <em>Le Prestidigitateur</em>. But his was double-handed; the very best are those released with one, as currently embodied by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO6t8nkZ97Q\" title=\"\">Stan Wawrinka</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpetCjBXZI\" title=\"\">Richard Gasquet</a>, their shots coming not with a punch but a swipe that says begone, the most stunningly chic dismissal imaginable.</p><p>Also significant is the magic of distance. Any fool with a tennis racket can hit a hard forehand but only those who are special can do it the other way round, especially with a single fist. And this is how aesthetic beauty must be, beyond the reach of almost everyone; even seeing the shot in ultramotion, it looks impossible for a forearm to do such a thing.</p><p>And this otherness adds further enchantment, just as there are no cultured right feet. Likewise, the most beautiful faces are defined by features and uniqueness rather than obeying standards that make them common because in order to captivate, first, something must capture.</p><p>But backhands are also better because they just are – we can only grasp what's aesthetically pleasing about something that's aesthetically pleasing up to a point because eventually, emotion and sensation take over. And describing that is like trying to put music into words or telling someone who's never bothered what it's like to be high; inevitably, you just end up sounding like an idiot.</p><h2>3) Seve Ballesteros</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430983051'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393590828946/Seve-Ballesteros-011.jpg' alt='Seve Ballesteros' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Seve Ballesteros in the sandhills of Royal Birkdale, at the 1976 Open. Photograph: John Leatherbarrow/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In the first chapter of the bible – please, bear with me – the author relates a yarn about the creation of man, in the image of God. Almost immediately, this is followed by a mandate to subdue or conquer the earth, explained by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik\" title=\"\">Joseph B Soloveitchik</a> as \"man's inner charismatic endowment as a creative being\", and whatever your opinions regarding the provenance of the text, it's roughly the project of our species.</p><p>Some people have come to know this bid for mastery as \"golf\", its players competing not against one another but against nature as represented by the course. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agkoArvKbOs\" title=\"\">there has been no individual more grippingly engaged in that battle than Severiano Ballesteros</a>.</p><p>There exits a thrilling dimension in all sports of possibilities becoming available only in disadvantageous positions – left-handers in hockey, say, or Mitchell Johnson's traditionally limiting angle of delivery. And sometimes, this feature is so pronounced as to alter the tactics of opponents: Ivan Lendl bored his way to victory over Miroslav Mecir in the 1989 Australian Open final via a stream of unthreatening shots sent deep down the middle.</p><p>But with no sportsman has there existed the same anticipation when things go wrong as there did with Ballesteros, his childlike love for getting into trouble matched by his genius in getting out of it. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItY3mn94JNA\" title=\"\">Whether  or wherever and whenever, a way would frequently be invented</a>. In 1979, playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zYjhkQZ66U\" title=\"\">the final round of the Open and in pursuit of his first major</a>, he clattered his drive at 16 into a car park and beneath a Morris Marina. So, taking a drop, he snapped a chip on to the green before draining a 20-footer for birdie; of course he did and of course he won.</p><p>Equally mesmeric was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smaouo-CCRU\" title=\"\">his effort in the 1983 Ryder Cup</a>, when, in a singles match with Fuzzy Zoeller, he fell from three-up, with five to play, to all-square on the final tee. Predictably and understandably, his drive ended up in deep rough, from where it was clumped into a bunker, leaving a sideways wedge shot as his only option. So he snatched the three-wood and nailed a drive to the cusp of the green before chipping and holing his putt; of course he did and of course he halved hole and match.</p><p>Although other sports involve battles similar to golf – swimming, skiing and the ilk – they demand skills that are technical in nature, along with an imperviousness to mortal fear. Seve, on the other hand – and our first-name terms are important – enveloped and infused an entire sport with the uniqueness of his spirit and wit. Golf is as much a game of intellect as anything else and none were as daring or piercing as Seve's, which, along with the rare coalescence of prettiness and handsomeness, created the perfect character. Everyone wanted to know him, everyone felt they knew him, those who actually did clearly loved it. And in going about his business, he fulfilled not just his earthly pursuit but all of ours, bending the natural world to his will for the glory of our entertainment.</p><h2>4) Eddy Merckx</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430983052'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393529287871/Eddy-Merckx-during-the-19-011.jpg' alt='Eddy Merckx during the 1969 Tour de France' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Eddy Merckx during the 1969 Tour de France. Photograph: Gilbert Iundt; Jean-Yves Rusznie/  Gilbert Iundt; Jean-Yves Ruszn</figcaption></figure><p>Not all beauty is rooted in pleasure. In April 1967, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC1Ru2p8OfU\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King gave his \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech</a>, in which he said:  \"We must move past indecision to action. Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter but beautiful struggle for a new world. This is the calling of the sons of God and our brothers wait eagerly for our response.\"</p><p>What MLK understood is that essence and object overrides practicality, such that the fight for freedom was necessarily beautiful, however appalling its practicalities. More recently, his phrasing was appropriated by one of his rhetorical successors, Yasiin Bey – then Mos Def – who commented that \"life is beautiful. Life is a struggle. Life is a beautiful struggle\". Shortly afterwards, his friend, Talib Kweli, recorded an album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JHcZS0iSw\" title=\"\">using those words as inspiration for its title</a>.</p><p>The relationship between suffering and beauty is extensive and profound; there exist relatively few great works of art provoked by intense happiness at the hilarity of it all. Shakespeare's best plays are his tragedies, arguably Bob Dylan's finest work discusses the breakdown of his marriage and few have written poetry or prose more stunning than Philip Larkin and Primo Levi; even Beethoven's interpretation of Ode to Joy was written as he struggled to cope with his deafness. Suffering has depth and, as an inevitable product of life, can be beautiful when imbued with humanity.</p><p>In a sporting context, there is nothing to compare to the pain imposed by the Tour de France, effectively a contest to discover which lunatic can endure the most; \"it means something to keep continually suffering to achieve something like that,\" explained Mark Cavendish. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ga_pHwDvu0\" title=\"\">no rider has inhabited that sentiment remotely to the extent that Eddy Merckx became it</a>. The purity of his passion was such that he would compete in ignorance of the prize money available because this was not what interested him – rather, it was what a French journalist called \"<em>rage de vaincre</em>\", the absolute fury to win, and the consequent need to punish himself and others with frightening prejudice.</p><p>Perhaps most famous example of his capacity for agony came in 1969, when he rode what many class as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRGeUyDkGGA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m33s\" title=\"\">greatest Tour stage</a>. Setting off on a four-hour solo jaunt through the Pyrenees for no reason whatsoever – he was already comfortably ahead in the race – it was described in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Merckx-Half-Man-Bike/dp/0224074512\" title=\"\">Merckx: Half Man, Half Bike</a>, as \"the ultimate expression of the way he did things\". That year, Merckx was awarded not only his first yellow jersey for winning the race but those in green and polka dot too, given to its best sprinter and king of the mountains respectively. No one since has come close to equalling that achievement.</p><p>Then, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqjEvDlFqdM\" title=\"\">in 1972, in a Mexico City velodrome</a>, he broke the world record for distance cycled in one hour – an absurd 49.4 kilometres. So extreme was his effort that several of his support team were compelled to tears and at its end he was carried off the track, uncharacteristically conceding that \"the pain was very, very, very significant\".</p><p>Finally, nearing the end of his career in 1975, he was placed second in the Tour when a neighbouring rider's swerve forced him over the handlebars. This resulted in a broken cheekbone and twice-fractured jaw, along with some concussion and slurred speech. But Merckx refused to retire, instead launching a futile assault on the lead, in sweltering conditions, prompting a watching writer to describe \"his jerky gestures, livid skin, his eyes sunk too far into his skull and the tic on one cheek twitching that gave him the look of a madman\". Unsurprisingly, this was \"frightening to see\".</p><p>The transformative, transcendent power of suffering is not a new idea, and one beloved in particular by religion – Catholicism is to significant extent defined by it, the Buddha felt it necessary to achieve his full potential and Jews and Muslims afflict their souls with Yom Kippur and Ramadan respectively. Likewise, though most individuals prefer to avoid pain, they may also emerge from the ordeal with an improved understanding of themselves that facilitates future happiness.</p><p>There are various explanations as to why Merckx behaved as he did but the most persuasive is offered by his wife Claudine – the person who knows him best. \"Eddy never looked for glory,\" she said. \"He just wanted to be at peace with himself.\" And given how terrifyingly difficult we all know that to be, there can be fewer more beautiful quests.</p><h2>5) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHrCESnHg08&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h32m41s\" title=\"\">Paul Scholes scoring for Manchester United v Panathinaikos (2000)</a></h2><p>In 1998-99, the Champions League was perfect; only 24 teams, with fixtures sufficiently infrequent to be an occasion and sufficiently frequent not to aggravate by omission. Clearly, this equilibrium could not be tolerated, prompting Uefa to set about things with vicious abandon, instituting a second group stage that strained tolerance, pockets and credulity alike.</p><p>So, in 1999-00, the competition proper began with 32 teams and there followed 96 games for the purpose of eliminating only half of them; nonsense. But, as sport is wont to do, it rescued the thick avarice of its administrators simply by virtue of being itself.</p><p>In the second group stage of the 2000-01 season, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/nov/21/championsleague.panathinaikos1\" title=\"\">Manchester United were playing at home to Panathinaikos</a>, leading 2-1 as the game struggled into its final minute and marking time accordingly. Then, from nowhere, there followed a meandering move incorporating every outfield player over the course of 34 passes, 77 touches and 83 seconds, ending when Teddy Sheringham flicked the ball between his legs for Paul Scholes to chip the keeper from 20 yards.</p><p>It might not have been the most beautiful move of all-time but few comparators have concluded as beautifully. Though, no doubt, there are some who prefer those finished by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUpKcyCfOJI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m35s\" title=\"\">Denis Irwin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kZPjdHZTg8\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSOpeYqgSI\" title=\"\">Mick Channon</a>or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZkR5Wb2KQs\" title=\"\">Carlos Alberto</a> – and, switching sports, Serge Blanco's try, scored by Philippe Saint-André.</p><p>However, the specific allure of the Scholes goal is not only in its nature but in its gratuitousness. Even as the move begins, there's no initial aim beyond the affecting of composure and perhaps some pretty patterns, until, suddenly and despite themselves, the protagonists find themselves weaving joy.</p><p>Because the passage is without point or purpose, the various numbers involved – the counting of which usually signifies a misguided attempt to quantify the unquantifiable – are part of the goal's substance. They relate not only the unusual length of its conception and gestation but offer a rare opportunity to observe spontaneous creation; a work of art performed for its own sake, and done because it couldn't not be done. And had any spectators in the ground have taken pre-match steps to experience an overwhelming unity and love for the world around them, then they would be able to confirm its ability to prompt a game of \"Scholes' Goal Was As Beautiful As\" – a variation of \"I Went to Market\", with less emphasis on accurately recollection of the previous few seconds.</p><p>But despite the specific and distinct beauties of all team goals – unlike every other variety, they are unique, and similar only in genre – most important is that which connects them. Each represents a coherence and co-operation that is, when all is said and done, the zenith of our miserable existence; more, please.</p><h2>6) Anderson Silva</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430983050'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393591032753/Anderson-Silva-011.jpg' alt='Anderson Silva' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Anderson Silva poses for a portrait shoot in 2007. Photograph: Kevin Lynch/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>It's recently become popular to describe counterattacking in sport as \"reactive\", that is to say a tactic used by those lacking the means to take control of situations. But the reality is very different. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2jCLTMPFU\" title=\"\">Arsenal's 2003-04 side</a>, for example, which, hampered by a relatively small Highbury pitch, would pull every man back when defending a corner, so that when they broke, every man was unmarked. Similarly, Manchester United – whose 92-94 team pioneered the modern method of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGnTdz4xqSo\" title=\"\">preparing to strike while still under pressure</a> – would, from 2006, not only draw in opponents but shepherd their possession into particular areas before dissecting them at speed.</p><p>And watching it unfold is a beautiful thing, not only visually but cerebrally, angles and passes fitting together like a double helix. But the intricacy of preparation and execution is nothing compared to that present in combat sports – and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcXV2uALZxc\" title=\"\">there has been no greater strategist than Anderson Silva</a>.</p><p>Silva is arguably the finest mixed martial artist of all-time, unbeaten between January 2006 and July 2013. In that period, he won 17 straight fights, of which 11 were for a title, and 15 inside the distance, with neither of those decisions remotely close. But though those numbers are impressive, they do not relate the nature of their accumulation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLUKJdkvu5w\" title=\"\">a mixture of high-stepping feet and knees mixed with technical, creative punches</a>  – what the colour commentator Joe Rogan described as \"a ballet of violence\".</p><p>And yet, the beauty of ballet and attendant beauty of that image still fails to complete the essence of Anderson's. The best example of what's missing can be seen <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa6vj9_aderson-silvads-vs-forrest-griffin_sport\" title=\"\">in a 2009 scuffle with Forrest Griffin</a> – a huge light-heavyweight who had only recently been deposed as champion and a man Silva, once a welterweight, fancied fighting for fun.</p><p>In the first 90 seconds of the bout, Griffin threw pretty much everything that he had, not particularly intending to connect but to intimidate with the breadth and ferocity of his arsenal. But as he did so Silva's mind locked into computer mode, logging respective distances; rather than show him why he should be wary, Griffin showed him what he had. And with two minutes gone, Silva had seen enough, weaving in, hands down, to floor his man with a right hook – thrown over the top of the left he'd clocked constantly dropping. Then, only a few punches later, Griffin is looking at the clock and Silva is calling him on; or, put another way, an elite, seasoned and proud fighter has been broken – in the space of 30 seconds.</p><p>So next, Silva thrusts out a few single pot-shots, then, hands virtually subterranean, invites threat in order to avoid it with dazzling sway-duck-sway combination, torso bending and rotating to facilitate a precisely measured straight left, brought from below the eyeline – to score another knockdown. Disbursing a few punches on the ground, he then offers to help up what is now a thoroughly befuddled opponent and Griffin tries once last time, running at him with wild flurries. These are avoided by simple withdrawal of the chin before Silva then rises to administer what appears to be no more than a bop on the nose – stepping back! – but again, the timing has been calculated so precisely as to level Griffin again, now spreadeagled and finished.</p><p>Rather than wait for the post-fight formalities, Griffin left the cage humiliated, outmanoeuvred and out-thought by Silva's natural, preternatural, relationship to angles. But, although he is beautiful for his slickness, elegance and barely believable serenity, he is also beautiful in the way that maths can be beautiful, intricate, complex, complete, and a human manifestation of abstract concepts.</p><p>Of course, beauty being mainly subjective, this variety won't tickle every soul; to some, Silva is not artist, only arse-kicker. But similar is so of all sportsmen, all competing with the specific aim of annihilating their opponents. Mitchell Johnson hesitated when asked recently whether there is greater pleasure in taking a wicket or hitting a batsman and there is little more brutal than deconstruction on a snooker table or chessboard. In 2007, Ronnie O'Sullivan dished out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA5WN7cMlug\" title=\"\">a hiding to Ding Junhui so severe as to reduce him to tears</a>, and the beating that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa12XYa1Ols&amp;feature=share&amp;t=3h27m\" title=\"\">Magnus Carlsen inflicted on Viswanathan Anand</a> only a few months ago left him as chastened as any defeated fighter. Generally, physical injuries heal quickly but mental trauma is far harder to take and shake.</p><p>Essentially, those who compete in combat are not fighters but athletes, involved for the same reasons as every other professional sportsman: love, money, talent and challenge. But in any event, much beauty is savage; plenty prefer waterfalls and canyons to sunsets and gardens. Similarly, childbirth is one of the most harrowing aspects of the human experience but there remains little more beautiful than the emergence of a life.</p><p>So, two men locked in honest, honourable combat with just their bodies and minds on which to rely, is something; there are no net cords, kicks, grubbers or bad bounces. Yes, it can be harsh, and yes it always hurts, but it's also true – and truth is a rare and special thing. To the extent that humanity is beautiful, that is beautiful.</p>","headline":"The Joy of Six: sporting beauty","trailText":"<p><strong>Daniel Harris:</strong> From David Rudisha to Justine Henin's backhand, via Seve Ballesteros, Eddy Merckx and Anderson Silva</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n64q","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393590234034/David-Rudisha-006.jpg","wordcount":"3861","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/28/joy-of-six-sporting-beauty","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/28/joy-of-six-sporting-beauty","tags":[{"id":"sport/series/joyofsix","webTitle":"The Joy of Six","type":"series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/joyofsix","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/series/joyofsix","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danielharris","webTitle":"Daniel Harris","r2ContributorId":"28429","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/5/1302019018185/Daniel_Harries.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Harris is a freelance writer and journalist.

It clearly has gone wrong and the family have every right to be aggrieved and I hope she makes a full recovery, as much as she can,\" said Penning.</p><p>Holt, who has suffered from physical and mental health problems, was contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions, which invited her to attend \"intensive job-focused activity\", according to her MP Simon Danczuk. She fell into a coma in December last year and the government and its contractor were informed, the Labour MP told the Commons.</p><p>During his speech, Danczuk read from a letter sent to the Holt family, who live in Rochdale in Greater Manchester. \"It said, 'Dear Ms Holt, you are now approaching the end of the first stage of your intensive job focused activity. We hope that all the activity or training intervention completed so far has not only supported you to achieve your aspirations but has moved you closer to the job market.</p><p>\"'You will shortly enter the second stage of your intensive job-focused activity. Sessions and workshops may vary depending on the centre you attend'.\"</p><p>He said the letter was dated 30 January. Danczuk added: \"I should inform the House that members of Sheila's family repeatedly informed the DWP and Seetec (a contractor carrying out work capability assessments) about this fact that she wasn't well but they continued to get harassed by those organisations.\"</p><p>He added that Holt has suffered from severe bipolar disorder since childhood. \"She has not been in employment since she was 16 years old. However she was pushed into the Work Programme before Christmas and she was finding it extremely difficult.</p><p>\"She was also concerned about the fact around the increases in the council tax benefit that she had to pay. On 17 December she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act because she was struggling to cope.</p><p>\"Whilst in hospital she had a heart attack and that's caused her to be in a coma since then. We are now at the end of February. I can report to the House that Sheila is stable, she is still in the coma.\"</p><p>He added: \"Let's make this important point – before the election when the prime minister toured the TV studios he often talked about 'Broken Britain'. Well I have to say that if this is the prime minister's idea of fixing broken Britain, hounding disabled people who suffer from mental breakdowns, harassing their distressed relatives, then I prefer the broken Britain that existed before.\"</p><p>Speaking after the exchange, Holt's father Ken, 74, said the government's welfare to work scheme was to blame for the severity of his daughter's condition.</p><p>The retired labourer said the stress of the threat of having her benefits stopped left Sheila clinging to life after she was hospitalised. He said her last job was 27 years ago but that Seetec wrote to her and she was forced to go on a job-seeking course for eight days.</p><p>After each day she became more and more agitated until she \"cracked\" her father said, and was hospitalised following a \"manic episode\".</p><p>\"If they had left her alone she would not be in this condition. They were threatening her with cuts and she needs the benefits.\"</p><p>\"I just believe it's all wrong, you should be chasing the people who are fit, get them to work, not them that are not fit. It's outrageous,\" he said.</p><p>Ken said he visited his daughter in hospital daily and that she has suffered \"very, very serious brain damage\" following a heart attack.</p><p>\"It's a matter of life and death,\" he said. \"She may not survive, that's how bad it is. All she can do is open her eyes and she shows she's in a lot of pain,\" he said.</p>","headline":"Minister apologises after woman in coma was told to find work","trailText":"<p>Sheila Holt was contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions who invited her to attend 'intensive job-focused activity'</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n67h","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393546825621/Mike-Penning-getting-out--003.jpg","wordcount":"675","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/minister-apologise-woman-coma-find-work","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/feb/28/minister-apologise-woman-coma-find-work","tags":[{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/benefits","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/benefits","references":[]},{"id":"society/coma","webTitle":"Coma","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/coma","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/coma","references":[]},{"id":"uk/manchester","webTitle":"Manchester","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/manchester","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevin-rawlinson","webTitle":"Kevin Rawlinson","r2ContributorId":"58554","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Rawlinson is a freelance reporter who writes for the Guardian and other publications.

When Jack met Jennifer</h2><p>This is perhaps my favourite Oscar moment ever, and it is from last year: the 85th Academy Awards in 2013. Tellingly, it does not take place up on stage, in the often tense and frozen ritual of the awards ceremony itself, but happens in the cheerful buzz of the post-show melee backstage. This single, endlessly replayed clip probably did more for Jennifer Lawrence's public profile than anything on the big screen.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJmhsJ5T5L0\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click here to see Jack Nicholson surprise Jennifer Lawrence</a></p><p>George Stephanopoulos, the former Bill Clinton aide who later made a career in TV, was conducting on-the-hoof interviews for ABC and had grabbed 22-year-old Lawrence to talk about her best actress Oscar for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148764/silver-linings-playbook\">Silver Linings Playbook</a>. The surreal spectacle of 75-year-old Jack Nicholson looming up behind Lawrence is riveting. Wiping his face and dark glasses, he then did a wacky Groucho-Marx-type lean into shot, and busted in on the conversation to flirt with a clearly stunned Lawrence. Unlike most Oscar set pieces, it is funny, relaxed and unscripted.</p><h2>2. Seth McFarlane's boob</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTKEDXNQAcc\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch McFarlane's downfall</a></p><p>Here is an Oscar moment we could have done without, again from last year. But it's fascinating in what it reveals  about the academy's perennial yearning for a younger, hipper, more ironic image – and how irony can go horribly wrong. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy, seemed like a great choice as host at first and was welcomed by many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/filmblog/2012/oct/01/seth-macfarlane-oscars-host\" title=\"\">(including, ahem, me).</a></p><p>It didn't work out, largely because of his notorious song We Saw Your Boobs, in which he listed all the female stars who have shown their breasts on film. MacFarlane had attempted to hedge this performance with irony – William Shatner comes from the future to warn him how offensive it was going to be – and with a kind of sexual correctness: the gay men's chorus of Los Angeles were his backing singers. He even got some stars in the audience to play along and look horrified, but they were sadly under-rehearsed and under-directed. People thought it was a misfire, particularly the song's mention of Jodie Foster in The Accused (she was playing a rape victim).</p><h2>3. The streaker</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I3bNlK2_k\" title=\"\"> Reading on mobile? Click here to see Niven's withering ad-lib</a></p><p>This is one of the most legendary Oscar moments, at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974, when the event was less strictly policed. But was this mythic moment as spontaneous as we thought? Just as he was about to introduce Elizabeth Taylor, David Niven is bemused to find a steaker behind him – and with remarkable sang-froid made his legendary off-the-cuff remark. The streaker was gay rights activist Robert Opel, who had press accreditation for The Advocate magazine, and had managed to sneak backstage to get his kit off. But how had he managed it? Security wasn't all that lax, even for the groovy 70s, and many people were startled that broadcaster NBC allowed him a press conference later. Was it a set-up? Everyone swears not.</p><h2>4. John Wayne's farewell </h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og8pywu8gbU#t=4m12s\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click here to see John Wayne's last public appearance</a></p><p>At the 51st Academy Awards in 1979, John Wayne came onstage to present the Oscar for best picture, and his appearance was genuinely moving. The Oscars love ancestor worship, but this is usually in the context of a lifetime-achievement award, presented to someone who is old but otherwise cheerfully fit. This was different. John Wayne was not getting an award, but visibly in the final stages of cancer, drawn and tired, but good-humoured, thanking the audience for their applause – \"just about the only medicine a fella'd ever really need\". It was his last public appearance and he died a few months later.</p><h2>5. George Bernard Shaw's historic achievement</h2><p>At the 11th Academy Awards in 1939, George Bernard Shaw became a pub-quiz staple for becoming the only person to have won both an Oscar and a Nobel prize. With other co-writers, he got best adapted screenplay for the 1938 film Pygmalion starring Wendy Hiller, taken from his play (later this would become the musical My Fair Lady, without Shaw's involvement). His Nobel prize in literature had been awarded in 1925. Sadly, there is no online footage of the Oscars for this year.</p><p>Shaw did not attend the ceremony, but his Oscars \"moment\" came with his grand dismissal of the Hollywood establishment for presuming to give him one of its baubles: \"They might as well send some honour to George for being King of England\". However, the statuette was to be seen in his house in England.</p><h2>6. Emma Thompson and Jane Austen</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqAaI0qdGM8\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click here to see Thompson's speech</a></p><p>There's a certain amount of amiable mickey-taking when Emma Thompson is mentioned in the press now, but perhaps it's time to put this condescension behind us and remember not only how huge Emma Thompson was in 90s Hollywood, but also that she is the only person in Oscar history to get wins for both acting and writing – that is, for Howard's End in 1992 and Sense and Sensibility in 1995 – an achievement that still eludes all those alpha males before whom journalists swoon. Here is a great moment for her, the acceptance speech for Sense and Sensibility at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996, wittily describing a visit to Jane Austen's grave.</p><h2>7. Did Emil Jannings' best actor Oscar save him from getting shot?</h2><p>There is no online video of Emil Jannings's encounter wi
