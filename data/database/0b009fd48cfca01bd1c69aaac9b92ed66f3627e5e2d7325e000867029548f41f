Award winners can promote their environmental and ethical credentials on the basis they have been rigorously assessed by a team of expert and celebrity judges with a broad knowledge and experience in the field. Each year the number and quality of entries increases and I am looking forward to judging the awards again in 2013.\" </p><p><em>Prof. Rob Holdway, director Giraffe Innovation Ltd</em></p><p>It is always a real pleasure to be involved with the Ethical Awards, alongside such well respected individuals.

fashion.</p><p>The filaments produced by ECONYLÂ® are in fact used to produce more sustainable clothing such as socks, swimwear and underwear.</p><p>ECONYLÂ® is also a process that tends to infinity

These products harness the power of nature. Ecover's aim is to provide effective sustainable alternatives to be used everyday by people the world over.</p><p>However, Ecover's ecological principles extend far beyond the products they createâ€¦</p><p>Ecover's vision of sustainability takes ecological, economic and social aspects into account from the origins of the raw materials, to the complete biodegradation of the final products. Strict criteria are employed by Ecover's scientists along the way as guidelines for all business operations, from selecting raw materials, through production methods to full decomposition of the end products.</p><p>The products originate from Ecover's unique ecological factories in Belgium and France, both factories are crowned with a green roof that supports wild flowers and sedum and is an effective and efficient temperature-regulator and noise-dampening insulator throughout the year. Thanks to the employees, the factory's energy consumption is kept to a minimum; staff will only turn lighting and heating on when and where it is really necessary and as a result, it is hardly used in the summer months. Ecover also stimulates energy-conscious behaviour outside the factory walls; employees are encouraged to travel to work regularly by bicycle or car share and are remunerated for their efforts.</p><p>Ecover operates with sustainability at its core, constantly innovating and pushing boundaries to create new and more effective products that have minimum impact on the environment, and consistently achieves extraordinary ethical standards with its products, management and production methods. As a pioneer within an increasingly large ecological industry, Ecover is thrilled to be involved with the Observer Ethical Awards 2014.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing which innovative, inspirational and like-minded people are nominated, and ultimately who will win one of the nine awards on offer. Our hope is that through our day-to-day work and support of the awards we encourage many more people to follow a more sustainable and ethical way of living.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.diy.com/content/marketing/one_planet_home/forest_friendly.jsp?menu=eco\" rel=\"nofollow\"></p><h2>B&amp;Q</h2><p></a></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427864671'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/01/21/b-q.gif' alt='B&Q' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> B&amp;Q is one of the UK's largest retailers and a leader in corporate sustainability strategy.

She has procured grants for a '20s plenty' campaign on the road outside and helped to halt plans for a local incinerator by organising public meetings and bringing in experts from Germany to talk about alternatives. Not content, Kendra also resurrected the local Friends of the Earth group which was about to fold. It is now flourishing.

Douglas and Emily have fought tooth and nail to save this formerly neglected space for the local community. Working on the assumption that in order to protect a space the community has to value it, they have organised many events that have attracted hundreds of families. Those who benefit from it tell us 'the land is now rich with wildlife, free from litter and an antidote to manicured spaces around the city'. It is an important wild space for children to explore safely and learn about nature and has its very own forest school. Glasgow City Council has suggested it will sell the land.

He started off in Worthing and from there he has moved to work all over the UK. What he doesn't know about the pop up format isn't worth knowing.

Along with volunteers from the school groups attending the centre dad has planted more than 8000 native trees and new hedgerows. He transformed a large area of wasteland near the centre into a wild flower meadow which is mown with scythes for hay to give to a local farmer each year. Dad also established a voluntary branch of Tools for Self Reliance which has collected and refurbished more than 10,000 tools and 100 sewing machines to be sent to some of the poorest people in Africa. The group meets weekly.

Ecover's aim is to provide effective sustainable alternatives to be used everyday by people the world over.</p><p>However, Ecover's ecological principles extend far beyond the products they createâ€¦</p><p>Ecover's vision of sustainability takes ecological, economic and social aspects into account from the origins of the raw materials, to the complete biodegradation of the final products. Strict criteria are employed by Ecover's scientists along the way as guidelines for all business operations, from selecting raw materials, through production methods to full decomposition of the end products.</p><p>The products originate from Ecover's unique ecological factories in Belgium and France, both factories are crowned with a green roof that supports wild flowers and sedum and is an effective and efficient temperature-regulator and noise-dampening insulator throughout the year. Thanks to the employees, the factory's energy consumption is kept to a minimum; staff will only turn lighting and heating on when and where it is really necessary and as a result, it is hardly used in the summer months. Ecover also stimulates energy-conscious behaviour outside the factory walls; employees are encouraged to travel to work regularly by bicycle or car share and are remunerated for their efforts.</p><p>Ecover operates with sustainability at its core, constantly innovating and pushing boundaries to create new and more effective products that have minimum impact on the environment, and consistently achieves extraordinary ethical standards with its products, management and production methods. As a pioneer within an increasingly large ecological industry, Ecover is thrilled to be involved with the Observer Ethical Awards 2013.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing which innovative, inspirational and like-minded people are nominated, and ultimately who will win one of the nine awards on offer.

While investments can fall as well as rise and past performance is not a guide to the future, Jupiter has a strong reputation for delivering outperformance across its range of investment capabilities over the medium to long term. The Company has a long history of green investing and manages several funds of this type. It has an active sustainable investment and governance team.<br /> <br />At challenging economic times such as these it is significant that we are seeing a subtle, but important, shift towards longer-term thinking across a range of financial institutions. There are signs that chairmen are highlighting the importance of ethical leadership in their communications to shareholders via the Annual Report. As with many aspects of behavioural change, corporate responsibility and governance requires more than a token gesture.

It has since become one of the largest and most successful scheduled holiday companies in the UK, providing package and tailor-made holidays worldwide.</p><p>Built on the Virgin principles of excellent customer service, high quality and value for money, Virgin Holidays offers maximum convenience and flexibility with an emphasis on fun and excitement. Since its creation, it has gone from strength to strength, establishing itself as the number one holiday company to Florida and the Caribbean and expanding to sell destinations as diverse as Borneo, Buenos Aires, Boston and Bhutan, and holidays ranging from cruises to safaris. The company sells direct to consumers via the web, phone and an expanding network of standalone shops and concessions in department stores across the UK, as well as through long-standing trade partnerships. </p><p>Since 2008, a number of strategic acquisitions have seen Virgin Holidays expand to offer a complete range of holidays. This activity has seen Travel City Direct, Fasttrack Cruises (now Virgin Holidays Cruises) and Fasttrack Ski join the family and in September 2008 a new partnership to create Virgin Holidays+HIP Hotels, targeting travellers seeking a luxury break in one of the world's most distinctive boutique hotels. Finally, in 2009, Bales Worldwide, a specialist in escorted tours, was acquired.  </p><p>Virgin Holidays' success is frequently recognised by both consumer and trade audiences and the high levels of customer satisfaction scores it receives. Indeed, in 2010 the company was voted in to the top ten brands nationally for customer service. Its award wins are manifold, and have included Large Package Holiday Company of the Year (2010) and Best Overall Tour Operator for the USA, Caribbean and Canada in 2012 at the British Travel Awards.  <br />\t\t\t\t                                              <br />The company has a well-founded reputation for industry firsts â€“ whether it was the first CD-Rom brochure, the first underwater wedding or establishing the first customer loyalty scheme for a holiday company. Spring 2008 saw it open the v-room at London Gatwick, the world's only dedicated leisure departure lounge (since enjoyed by a second at Manchester Airport. Other customer-focused innovations rolled out in recent years include a 'Check in/Chill Out' service that enables customers to enjoy their holidays for a few hours more, an in-resort Concierge service that helps customers to plan their holiday before they leave and a series of hotel lounges for customers across the world. </p><p>Virgin Holidays also has a long-standing commitment to sustainable travel. In addition to being one of the founding supporters of the Travel Foundation (a donation from every holiday booking is made, raising an average of Â£250,000 annually), it's Human Nature Collection of holidays features of range of projects from Sri Lanka to Jamaica that have been implemented to 'give something back' to the destinations its customers enjoy visiting, the latest of which â€“ the

Every year culminates in the annual Sustain Show and Awards, which honour the very best of this graduate work, bringing to the fore excellence in sustainability, and showcasing the wide range of talent and expertise across the Royal College of Art.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sawday's Canopy &amp; Stars</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-406661076'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/01/17/conopyandstars.gif' alt='Canopy & Stars logo' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We treasure beautiful places to stay, the simple things in life and the chance to slow down.

class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Our ethical living columnist and awards founder, Lucy Siegle joins us as chair of the judging panel</figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the 2013 Observer Ethical Awards in association with Ecover. Back in 2005 when Annie Lennox joined us on stage to give out our first crop of Ethical Awards I'm not sure any of us realised how big a deal the awards would become. Since then we've become known (rather gratifyingly) as the \"green Oscars\", assessed thousands of entries and secured some of the biggest cultural and scientific movers and shakers around as judges (page 29 lists our extraordinary roll call of judges this year). Our generous sponsor, Ecover, has handed out thousands of pounds' worth of bursaries to support the next generation of young green champions. But the awards we launch today are our biggest celebration of environmental and social justice yet. They reflect the fact that over eight years the ethical landscape of the UK has broadened and deepened. </p><p>The UK is home to a magnificent spectrum of people and businesses who get it: sustainability doesn't happen by magic just as resource depletion doesn't just go away; it takes human effort and ingenuity to make life more ethical. Voting opens today so that you can reward that effort. The Observer has a longstanding affiliation with both environmental and social justice. It's notable that EF Schumacher, the economist now regarded as the founder of ethical living, worked through many of his ideas for how to live within ecological parameters while writing in the pages of the Observer. The awards are built on this foundation, but you don't require similar green heritage to enter, or to be working on a big scale. You may know of a potential winner operating on a very local scale indeed.</p><p>This year we're on the lookout for an <strong>unsung local hero</strong>, while through our <strong>well dressed</strong> category we want to celebrate the person who has got to grips with their own wardrobe, crowning the king or queen of ethical style in the UK. New for 2013, we are championing products and services with undeniable ecological intelligence, rewarding those that could prove to be a game changer on a small or large scale, making it easier for us to be ethical in every day life. And for the first time we're also looking for nominees in the <strong>travel</strong> industry. We're honouring those who prove travel can be world-changing in a positive way and that our wanderlust can have an ethical dividend. This is the year for the next generation of ethical agitators to step forward. We know our <strong>young green champions</strong> are not willing to sit around and wait to inherit a ruined planet so tell us what they are doing â€“ ï¿¡6,000<sup>1</sup> is on offer for the under-18s who have the best ethical project for 2013. For the first time we're also rewarding the teacher or supervising adult and their family who dedicate time and effort to making these ideas a reality. </p><p>Over eight years you have supported the awards process and our panel of judges by <a href=\"https://secure.easyanswer.net/ethicalawards\">voting and nominating</a> with great gusto. We need you to <a href=\"https://secure.easyanswer.net/ethicalawards\">vote and nominate</a> again with the same commitment and enthusiasm. We don't mind if you vote altruistically or because there are great prizes for voters. The end result is that between us, by June, we will have uncovered the brightest and best people, projects, campaigns and businesses making sure that we have an ethical future.</p><p><strong><sub><sup>1</sup>The winning project receives Â£6,000 in three annual Â£2,000 instalments. Instalments are paid subject to an annual project appraisal and agreed spending plan between the winner an Ecover.</sub></strong></p>","headline":"Welcome to the 2013 Observer Ethical Awards","trailText":"<p>Find out about the 2013 Observer Ethical Awards from our ethical living columnist and awards founder, Lucy Siegle</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/01/07/Welcome-140x84.gif","wordcount":"585","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"402432863","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Lucy Siegle","internalPageCode":"1853775","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-18T17:09:24Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/observer-ethical-awards/welcome-2013-observer-ethical-awards","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/observer-ethical-awards/welcome-2013-observer-ethical-awards","tags":[{"id":"observer-ethical-awards/observer-ethical-awards","webTitle":"Observer ethical awards","type":"keyword","sectionId":"observer-ethical-awards","sectionName":"Observer Ethical Awards","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/observer-ethical-awards/observer-ethical-awards","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/observer-ethical-awards/observer-ethical-awards","references":[]},{"id":"tone/event-descriptions","webTitle":"Event descriptions","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/event-descriptions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/event-descriptions","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lucysiegle","webTitle":"Lucy Siegle","r2ContributorId":"20651","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/08/lucy__siegle140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucysiegle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/lucysiegle","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-405198281","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/gif","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/01/07/Welcome-140x84.gif","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","altText":"Observer Ethical Awards 2013: welcome and about","height":"84","credit":"Guardian","width":"140"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-405198282","relation":"body","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/15/1358268897069/Lucy-Siegle-003.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Lucy Siegle","altText":"Lucy Siegle","height":"140","credit":"Lucy Siegle","caption":"Our ethical living columnist and awards founder, Lucy Siegle joins us as chair of the judging panel","width":"140"}}]}]}],"storyPackage":[]}}
