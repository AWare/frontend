I don’t count myself among the believers of that view, but reading Barry’s book skirred me back to being 17 so often that time lost its boundaries while I read.</p> <p>Barry’s Lennon is 37: it is 1978, two years before he is murdered. He is an icon, leaving an infant son in New York City to journey west of Ireland, to spend time on a small island he owns. Lennon has been engaged in Primal Therapy – <a href=\"http://www.primaltherapy.com/about-john-lennon-primal-therapy.php\">a practice tried by the real star</a> – and hopes to be alone on his island so that he can “scream his fucking lungs out” and cast his demons into the sea. Once word gets out of his presence on the island a handler takes Lennon into hiding, and for much of the book, the musician reflects on a life that has wearied him, one full of what his therapist Dr. Janov calls “amorphous doom and nameless dread.” I was the same age when my own life took serious turns: I would leave my marriage and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/09/23/when_i_couldnt_feed_my_family/\">begin my own period</a> of doom and dread.</p> <p>For me, with these parallels, reading Beatlebone was a long process, one where I would pause as memories would crawl up, pawing at me like insistent puppies demanding attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/beatlebone-kevin-barry-review-beatle-island\">Beatlebone by Kevin Barry review – a darkly wry trip to Beatle Island</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also stopped for other reasons: Barry’s beautiful sentences kept me copying graceful passages into my journal. Some sentences reminded me of my recently dead father, who as a Mancunian lad in the 1950s, fancied himself a Teddy Boy. “Reception is deserted but they’re banging pots and pans together out the back. A demented brass band. Morning engagements only”: this is the kind of passage that I would have called up Dad to read to him, to remind him of his own days performing.</p> <p>It’s a dark book, but there is humour too: Lennon’s writing block is personified by the ghost-like presence of Brian Wilson (whose Beach Boys album Pet Sounds spurred Lennon and McCartney to write better songs). The song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y-0nWVdBH4\">Don’t Worry, Baby</a> is Lennon’s earworm in Beatlebone; and Barry’s Beatlebone was mine. It was a book I couldn’t get out of my head, becoming messed up with my own memories of the autumn leading up to Lennon’s assassination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"break\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&gt;&lt;base href=. target=_blank&gt;&lt;style type=text/css&gt;.break:before{content:'';display:block;width:30%;margin-top:23px;height:3px;background-color:#fdadba}p{margin:0}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p class=break&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That autumn in 1980, when I was 17, was tumultuous. I had spent the entire summer working for a Congressional candidate in my home district. On 4 November, I gathered with my co-workers and the Congressman and watched in horror as everything we held dear was trounced by Ronald Reagan in a landslide election. It wasn’t enough that President Carter conceded the election three hours before the polls closed on the west coast, thus sending voters who had been waiting in line home in droves. As we watched, each of the Senate’s liberal warhorses, Frank Church, Birch Bayh, George McGovern – and, to our horror, our own Senate “workhorse” Warren “Maggie” Magnuson – all lost their seats. While our representative had a safe district and re-won his seat, the funereal mood in the room led to plenty of grief-driven drinking.<br /></p> <p>All summer long and into the fall, I had been in love with one of my young co-workers. Previously, after a couple of glasses of wine, I had showed up at his doorstep, determined to declare my love. He had acted the perfect gentleman, cooking me dinner as he played me his favourite records, including those of his hero John Lennon.</p> <p>After hours of listening to Lennon’s oeuvre (and that of other artists, including Jackson Browne and The Beach Boys), he had delivered me sober and untouched to my parents’ house. I had swallowed the indignity, and the night had gone unremarked upon for months.</p> <p>This night, however, the evening of the election, he offered me a ride home. As we got into his car, he told me that he could a) drop me off at my folks’ house, or b) take me home to his. I chose b) and we spent the night trying to make each other feel better about the election results.</p> <p>The next morning, as I was waking up thinking that he had finally realised that he loved me too, the first words out of his mouth were: “Last night was a mistake.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"first quote\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&gt;&lt;base href=. target=_blank&gt;&lt;style type=text/css&gt;.pullquote-paragraph:before{content:'';display:block;width:30%;margin-bottom:10px;height:3px;background-color:#fdadba}.pullquote-paragraph{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:2rem;line-height:1.1;color:#951c55;margin:24px 0 8px}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.pullquote-paragraph{font-size:1.5rem}}.citation{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.2;color:#767676;margin:6px 0 0}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.citation{font-size:1rem}}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=wrapper&gt;&lt;p class=pullquote-paragraph&gt;He’ll have a fag and a brandy instead — tamp all that stuff down.

A few weeks went past, and I realised that I was late. This was back in 1980: home pregnancy tests did not exist, and the campus health centre informed me that I could not be tested until a full two weeks after the day I should have started my period. I debated not telling him, but then I did. He was not happy. He was supposed to be leaving right after Christmas for several months travelling in Europe. A baby was not what he had in mind.</p> <p>I tried to focus on my studies, but all I could think was that I had wrecked my chance of escaping my working-class existence, the one my parents transplanted from Manchester to America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"second quote\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&gt;&lt;base href=. target=_blank&gt;&lt;style type=text/css&gt;.pullquote-paragraph:before{content:'';display:block;width:30%;margin-bottom:10px;height:3px;background-color:#fdadba}.pullquote-paragraph{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:2rem;line-height:1.1;color:#951c55;margin:24px 0 8px}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.pullquote-paragraph{font-size:1.5rem}}.citation{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.2;color:#767676;margin:6px 0 0}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.citation{font-size:1rem}}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=wrapper&gt;&lt;p class=pullquote-paragraph&gt;He finds a channel that shows Monty Python at five in the morning.

Domestication can be the enemy of the creative. Years later, when I had my own babies, I loved them madly, and at the same time wondered if my creative brain would ever emerge from the endless nappies and mindless games on the floor.</p> <p>Now, from a distance, I can see just how awful it must have been for that man in 1980. It was supposed to be his time to travel and see the world before returning to begin law school.</p> <p>And law school? How would he and I have supported ourselves with both of us in school? My own mother had given birth to me at 17: was I really willing to throw away a future free of such encumberments? I had thought about abortion, but as much as I was committed to other women’s rights to terminate their pregnancies, I felt twisted in my confusion. I can only imagine what coiled thing sat in his belly while he waited to hear. Lennon once sang that he was “so tired, my mind is on the blink”: that was the two of us, during those weeks of waiting.</p> <p>Even for someone like Lennon, who had every advantage that a parent could want, fatherhood lent an order to his life that he thrived upon, but drove him round the bend at the same time. Barry’s portrayal of that doubled sense of the self – the one who loves the child but rues the lost sense of<em> me –</em> hit me like an icy punch from an Alberta clipper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"break\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&gt;&lt;base href=. target=_blank&gt;&lt;style type=text/css&gt;.pullquote-paragraph:before{content:'';display:block;width:30%;margin-bottom:10px;height:3px;background-color:#fdadba}.pullquote-paragraph{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:2rem;line-height:1.1;color:#951c55;margin:24px 0 8px}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.pullquote-paragraph{font-size:1.5rem}}.citation{font-family:EgyptianHeadline,&quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif;font-weight:200;font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.2;color:#767676;margin:6px 0 0}@media screen and (max-width:619px){.citation{font-size:1rem}}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=wrapper&gt;&lt;p class=pullquote-paragraph&gt;I want to be that fucking lonely I’ll want to fucking die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=citation&gt;Beatlebone p. 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He called me every day to ask if I had started yet. If the circumstances were different, this attention from him would be just what I had wanted.</p> <p>The first day I can go in and be tested is 7 December. Results will take 24 hours. I make arrangements to meet him the following afternoon. He wants to hear the news in person, and he drives 90 minutes up to meet me. When I tell him that the results were negative – we have dodged a baby – his relief is loud. It is obvious that as of this moment, he is rid of me, and he couldn’t be more happy. While I’m happy to not be pregnant, I’m hurt that he is so bloody happy to be rid of me.</p> <p>I am sleeping when the phone rings in my dorm room later in the evening. It’s my mum, and I kick myself for having forgotten to call and wish her a happy anniversary. But her voice cracks:</p> <p>“John Lennon was murdered,” she says.</p> <p>I know that he will be devastated. I debate what to do. I do what I think is the right thing: I call him to tell him how sorry I am, how much I know he must be hurting at the death of his hero.</p> <p>He doesn’t want to talk to me, and I hang up the phone.

This sentence carries on it the shiver of impending death.</p> <p>In this last month, when we lost so many musical icons, we have been reminded that it is our dead musical heroes that make us, too. After John Lennon died, many were willing to re-examine his marriage to Yoko Ono, to stop seeing her as the harridan who broke up the Beatles, and instead as the wife who had given Lennon stability and tranquility. In recent articles about the loss of David Bowie, much has been made of how his marriage to Iman relieved him of a profound loneliness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beatlebone transported me both in space and time, often causing me to laugh out loud at its humour, to shed tears at its truthfulness.

Both Dark-Hunters and Shadowhunters have enchanted swords that are divinely forged, imbued with otherworldly spirits, have unique names, and glow like heavenly fire.”</p> <p>According to the lawsuit, Kenyon “was alerted by some of her distressed fans” in 2006 about Clare’s planned publication “of a work that incorporated [Kenyon’s] Dark-Hunter Marks”. Kenyon asked for the Dark-Hunter references to be removed, the lawsuit says, and Clare did so, replacing it with the term “shadowhunter”. But according to Kenyon, despite assurances that use of the shadowhunter term would not be expanded, “[Clare] has persisted over time in expanding her use of the term ‘shadowhunters’ from a mere description of her protagonists, first to a tag line on the cover of her works and eventually to a complete rebranding of her works so as to be confusingly similar to the Dark-Hunter Series”.</p> <p>Kenyon’s suit, which <a href=\"http://www.courtneymilan.com/cc-complaint/1-3.pdf\">also lays out similarities between characters</a>, says that when the series are compared “in many respects, the elements are virtually identical”. </p> <p>“These substantially similar elements, coupled with [Clare’s] access to the Dark-Hunter Series, which were widely disseminated, leave little doubt that numerous substantive original elements of the Dark-Hunter Series have been copied by [Clare],” it says. “[Clare], in writing The Mortal Instruments and the Shadowhunters Series knowingly and wilfully copied the Dark-Hunter Series and original elements therein to create a work or works substantially similar to and derivative of the Dark-Hunter Series.”</p> <p>The case was first highlighted <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/02/08/copyright-clash-over-demon-fighting-stories.htm\">by Courthouse News</a>, with the historical romance novelist Courtney Milan then <a href=\"http://www.courtneymilan.com/cc-complaint/1-main.pdf\">obtaining the documents</a>.</p> <p>Milan, a former professor of law, tweeted yesterday that “Sherrilyn Kenyon didn’t invent the idea of band of humans fighting supernatural”, and that “she’s claiming ownership over the idea that most humans are blind to a supernatural world and are given a name. She didn’t invent that.”</p> <p>“Ninety-five per cent of what she is claiming are character tropes and journeys and items from our shared literary background,” wrote Milan on Twitter. “Literally both stories draw from our collective mythological history. THAT’S WHY THERE ARE SIMILARITIES … fundamental to the idea of copyright protection is that you can’t copyright ideas, only the expression of them … If you could copyright ideas, nobody would be able to write anything. Ever.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/697105795008204801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People talking about an &quot;agreement&quot; that Clare violated: If there was an agreement it should have been included as an exhibit.

According to the Bookseller, Clare’s UK sales are £6.65m.</p> <p>On her website, Clare writes that the idea for the Mortal Instruments series came to her when she visited a tattoo shop with a friend. “She wanted to show me that her footprints were on the ceiling in black paint. In fact, the footprints of everyone who’d worked there were on the ceiling, crisscrossing each other and making patterns. To me, it looked like some fabulous supernatural battle had been fought there by beings who’d left their footprints behind,” <a href=\"http://www.cassandraclare.com/frequently-asked-questions/about-the-books/\">writes Clare</a>. “I started thinking about a magical battle in a New York tattoo shop, and the idea of a secret society of demon-hunters whose magic was based on an elaborate system of tattooed runes just sprang into my mind.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gt56","wordcount":"736","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bc33d05495933b07290e8649bbb9472163273fac/152_140_1081_647/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>The bestselling fantasy author of the Dark-Hunter books is seeking damages from her fellow bestseller for allegedly using her ideas in the Shadowhunter series</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/sherrilyn-kenyon-sues-cassandra-clare-for-wilfully-copying-her-novels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/10/sherrilyn-kenyon-sues-cassandra-clare-for-wilfully-copying-her-novels","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"bc33d05495933b07290e8649bbb9472163273fac","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bc33d05495933b07290e8649bbb9472163273fac/152_140_1081_647/1000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Fine Art Photography","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/bc33d05495933b07290e8649bbb9472163273fac","altText":"Sherrilyn Kenyon","caption":"‘Numerous substantive original elements of the Dark-Hunter Series have been copied’ ...

Fotouhi for Tehran Bureau","headline":"Tales of exile and of home: Iranian diaspora in literature","trailText":"Author Sanaz Fotouhi looks at Iranian fiction in English, and chooses four favourites","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When I was at university studying English literature, I took an interest in diasporic and migrant writings. Authors from India, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean all told the same kind of stories of exile and resettlement. Their books raised a shared set of concerns, reflecting homelessness, loss and attempts to reconstruct identity. </p> <p>As someone who is part of the Iranian diaspora, my heart connected to these stories, but at the same time I felt something was missing. Yes, I sympathised with the writers and related to their experiences, but I could not identify with the cultural details. </p> <p>I felt my voice, as an Iranian living away from my homeland, was missing. Back then, in the late 1990s, there were few Iranians writing in English about their experiences. </p> <p>This changed one summer when browsing a dingy bookstore in Hong Kong, I came across Susan Pari’s The Fortune Catcher<em>. </em>I read the book in two days, weeping my way through it. Finally someone had depicted my very own Iranian experience in English. Now the world might understand our stories. Stumbling on this book was the beginning of a journey that has <a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Literature%20%20literary%20studies/Literature%20history%20%20criticism/Literary%20studies%20general/Literary%20studies%20from%20c%201900/Literature%20of%20the%20Iranian%20Diaspora%20The%20Meaning%20and%20Identity%20Since%20the%20Islamic%20Revolution.aspx?menuitem={346AAED2-98AA-4E76-87CA-9DE421E1C32D}\">preoccupied my life</a>. </p> <p>Over the next several years, I dedicated myself to finding, reading, and researching the literature of the Iranian diaspora. Gradually, I came upon an emerging body of work. These books grew from a handful in the late 1990s to around 300 today. </p> <p>Having read most of the books by Iranian writers in English, at least those that I could get my hands on, I see a body of work that paints a beautifully diverse picture of the Iranian diaspora, and makes a great contribution to the way Iranians are seen and see themselves. </p> <p>Some of these books have won international acclaim. Azar Nafisi’s Reading Lolita in Tehran (2004) and Azadeh Moaveni’s Lipstick Jihad (2005) are well known. Porochista Khakpour’s Sons and Other Flammable Objects<em> </em>(2006)<em> </em>and her recent The Last Illusion<em> </em>(2014), as well as Mahbod Seraji’s Rooftops of Tehran<em> </em>(2009), are also popular. </p> <p>But<em> </em>there are many that have not received the attention they deserve. Here are my four favourites among the less well known.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://ginabnahai.com\">Gina Nahai</a> Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith (2000)<br /></li> </ul> <p>Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith traces the history of Iranian Jewish mothers and daughters through the troubled relationship between Lili and her mother Roxanna. Told lyrically, and in poetic language, Nahai takes us from Tehran’s Jewish community<strong> </strong>to life in Los Angeles, enhancing the story by granting her characters magical powers. In a world where Roxanna can fly and where magic rituals can heal, Nahai constructs a world where Jewish Iranian women can go beyond the limits of their social, cultural, historical - and even their country’s - borders to reclaim their own identity. This is an absolute masterpiece, marking the entrance of Iranian writing in English into the tradition of magical realism. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.mparvin.com\">Manoucher Parvin</a> Dard e Del: Rumi, Hafez and Love in New York<em> </em>(2003)<br /></li> </ul> <p>A novel in verse, this is a wonderfully light-hearted account of Rumi and Hafez’s reincarnation as modern-day New Yorkers. When Professor Pirouz - a lonely academic of Iranian background in America, and a recurring character in Parvin’s work - decides to commit suicide, he travels to a desert and confesses his problems to two cacti, which happen to be reincarnations of Rumi and Hafez. </p> <p>After discouraging Pirouz from committing suicide and sending him back home, they transform into New Yorkers and so begin to re-invent themselves for modern audiences. A witty, yet underrated book, Dard e Del transforms Iran’s beloved poets from the pages of history to become accessible characters. The book is a gem that changes the way Persian poetry is seen and read today beyond Iran.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.paaia.org/cms/morteza-baharloo.aspx\">Morteza Baharloo</a> The Quince Seed Potion (2004)<br /></li> </ul> <p>A novella set in Iran, The Quince Seed Potion tells the story of Sarv e Ali, a young boy who is sexually abused by his uncle, grows up with homosexual tendencies, and ends up as a servant in a prominent family. Set against Iran’s turbulent history leading up to the Revolution, the book follows his struggle as he tries throughout his life to hide or overcome his ‘disease’. A touching story, this is one of the first books in English addressing sexual abuse and homosexuality in Iran through literature, and is also unusual in taking the often hidden and unheard voice of a mere servant.</p> <ul> <li>Massud Alemi <a href=\"http://ibexpub.com/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&amp;products_id=277\">Interruption</a>s (2008)<br /></li> </ul> <p>Another book dealing with male sexuality, this is the story of a young homosexual teacher who is picked up during protests in Iran on charges of being the leader of the rioters. Incarcerated for a while, he has to make up a fantastical tale to avoid revealing his sexuality. </p> <p>Like Shahrazad, the queen and storyteller of One Thousand and One Nights, he weaves stories to captivate his interrogator and evade death. But death, as it turns out, is not always physical. This is another wonderful book addressing crucial but underrepresented issues about Iranian society.<em> </em></p> <p><em>Sanaz Fotouhi is the author of <a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/books/humanities/history/regional%2520%2520national%2520history/asian%2520history/middle%2520eastern%2520history/literature%2520of%2520the%2520iranian%2520diaspora%2520the%2520meaning%2520and%2520identity%2520since%2520the%2520islamic%2520revolution.aspx?menuitem=%257bf3a45066-008f-41e1-bae9-603a568cd1ae%257d\">The Literature of the Iranian Diaspora: Meaning and Identity since the Islamic Revolution</a> (2015). </em><em>The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

But now grown up herself and a leading historian of 20th-century diplomacy, MacMillan is happy to admit that gossiping is one of her basic stocks in trade. The personalities of history – the goodies, the baddies, the hot ones and the plain wicked – aren’t confined to middle-brow biographies and scanty TV documentaries. They are actually what keep the conversation rattling along at academic conferences and high table. And to pretend otherwise is to miss out on what MacMillan calls with contagious glee, the sheer “fun” of rummaging around in the past.</p> <p>MacMillan isn’t, of course, advocating a Cleopatra’s nose approach to history, one in which complex events are ascribed tiny, accidental causes. Here is how that goes: if the Egyptian Queen had been an inch less beautiful, Antony wouldn’t have got distracted at Actium, thus his rival Augustus would never have been declared emperor and we would never have had Christianity … and so on. On the contrary, throughout her career MacMillan has insisted on giving full measure to the great faceless forces that drive history. She is as attentive to crop failure as she is to ancient nostrils, cares as much about the rise of Balkan nationalism in the early 20th century as about whether or not one particular Montenegrin warlord liked to carry around a sack stuffed with 60 severed enemy noses.</p> <p>It’s this ability to blend the macro and the micro, the big abstractions with the telling personal detail, that she brought to perfection in her book <em>Peacemakers</em>, which won the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/samueljohnsonprize2002\">Samuel Johnson prize in 2002</a>. This tells the story of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 through the rich cast of statesmen, scoundrels, ideologues and canny pragmatists, who descended on the city in the hope of influencing the blueprint for a new Europe. Now, in <em>History’s People</em>, which is a transcript of five public lectures delivered in Canada last year, MacMillan expands and further illustrates her belief that you can’t understand the past simply be tracing out its blind drivers – economics, ideology, religion. You’ve got to pay attention to the people on the ground, too, to the flesh-and-blood individuals who scurried around trying to make sense of it all.</p> <p>She organises the book around personality traits: hubris, persuasion, daring, curiosity and, in a slightly awkward linguistic shift, observers. Under these headings are nestled short case histories that allow the reader to hop from potted accounts of FD Roosevelt and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/dec/31/bismarck-escaped-blame-first-world-war\">Bismarck</a> (persuasion) to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\">Thatcher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joseph-stalin\">Stalin</a> (hubris) to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/richard-nixon\">Nixon</a> and Samuel de Champlain (daring). Everywhere MacMillan is on the alert for those places where the specifics of an individual life usefully complicate a more public history. For example, Nixon may indeed have shown flair and even courage in extending a hand to China in 1972, taking the first steps in a rapprochement that is still playing out today. But that doesn’t cancel the shaming fact that the American president was so instinctively unlikable that even his dog – bought for PR purposes – had to be bribed with biscuits to go anywhere near him.</p> <p>MacMillan is careful to do more than simply retell stories about powerful white men with armies at their disposal. There is a doughty Junker woman living on the family estate in Pomerania who stands up to bullying Russian occupation during the last months of the second world war. And also Victor Klemperer, the Dresden professor whose posthumously published diary provides a forensic account of how it felt to live as a Jew under the Third Reich. By attending to these stories, with their idiosyncratic shapes and odd, pebbly details, MacMillan shows how it becomes possible to get a purchase on such apparently monolithic narratives as the collapse of the German army or the Holocaust.</p> <p>In the chapter on curiosity, we meet Edith Durham, one of those genteel Edwardian spinsters who fell in love with a “primitive” society, Albania in this case, and devoted herself to it like a bad-tempered mother hen. For all Durham’s cultural fantasies – she preferred her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/albania\">Albanian</a>s to live as if it were the middle ages and became positively skittish around handsome warlords – she published one of the first serious historical and ethnographic studies of this part of the Balkans. She also worked tirelessly to extract Albania from the tottering Ottoman empire and, when that didn’t work, still managed to bustle it into the League of Nations. But any trace of Durham in her adopted homeland pretty much disappeared during Albania’s long agony under the nastiest kind of communism. Recently, though, there have been signs of Durham’s return: streets and schools in Tirana now bear her name, testimony to the way that stories of remarkable individuals survive in whispers even during years of savage state-sponsored amnesia.</p> <p>Sceptics may argue that by concentrating on personalities from the past we get lured into imagining that they were just like us, except dressed in funny clothes. But throughout this hugely enjoyable study, MacMillan shows herself mindful of the limitations, dangers even, of taking a biographical approach. Witness the case of Babur, a minor Central Asian prince who, by 1526, had managed to become the first Mughal emperor of India. Babur wrote a diary-cum-memoir, an extraordinary document that appears to give us immediate access to a man whom most people in the west would otherwise regard only as unfathomably exotic, a two-dimensional figure in a jewelled turban with a hawk on his wrist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/25/margaret-macmillan-just-dont-ask-me-who-started-war\">Margaret MacMillan: 'Just don't ask me who started the first world war'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <em>Baburnama</em>, as it is known, is full of wonderfully humanising details, especially when, as a young man, the Prince drinks too much, does a shedload of drugs and feels wretched about it afterwards. But just at the point where the reader starts to construct Babur as something familiar – a frat boy perhaps, albeit one in pointy silk slippers – we stumble on something that makes him utterly strange. On one occasion, when his servants had failed to foil a poison attempt, Babur had his taster hacked to pieces and the cook skinned alive. At that moment the charming, silly boy disappears into a world of such careless, casual cruelty that we can only look on, appalled at his retreating figure.</p> <p>MacMillan doesn’t balk at this scene, or try to direct our attention elsewhere. Instead, she uses this moment of deep discomfort to make the point that following individuals as they thread through their worlds is not about setting up a cosy and uncritical identification with them. Rather, it is in those jolting moments in which people become opaque that we are reminded most forcefully that the past really is another country. By the end of this exhilarating book, you are left wondering whether it is those scholars insisting on an abstracted, impersonal approach to the past who are most at risk of missing the point.</p> <p>• <em>History’s People</em> by Margaret MacMillan (Profile Books, £12.99).

It will be set 19 years after the end of the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, published in 2007. Harry Potter is now “an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children”, according to a synopsis published on Pottermore last year, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/23/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-west-end-london-play-sequel-youngest-son\">play will focus on Harry’s youngest son, Albus Severus</a>.</p> <p>“While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places,” the Pottermore synopsis describes.</p> <p>Publisher Little, Brown released JK Rowling’s first adult book, The Casual Vacancy, as well as three crime novels written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith: The Cuckoo’s Calling, The Silkworm and Career of Evil.</p> <p>“JK Rowling and her team have received a huge number of appeals from fans who can’t be in London to see the play and who would like to read the play in book format,” said David Shelley, CEO of Little, Brown</p> <p>Literary agency The Blair Partnership, which represents Rowling, said the decision to publish the script of the play was taken following “massive public demand”.</p> <p>Split into two parts due to the “epic nature of the story” according to Rowling, those lucky enough to obtain tickets – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/28/booking-for-harry-potter-play-extended-due-to-high-demand\">the play sold out quickly when tickets went on sale in October</a> – can see it either on separate days or in one epic double bill. Twenty tickets for each performance will be released in an online lottery every Friday afternoon for the duration of the play’s run.</p> <p></p> <p>Bloomsbury, the UK publisher of the seven Harry Potter books, also <a href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2016/02/bloomsbury-reveal-plans-to-celebrate-twentieth-potter-annnivesary/\">announced plans</a> to mark the 20th anniversary of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in 2017, with four new editions of the book, each representing one of the houses at Hogwarts school: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gt8b","wordcount":"463","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101/0_117_1772_1064/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I &amp; II will be published the day after the play begins in London, picking up the wizard’s story 19 years after the final novel in the series</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101/0_117_1772_1064/1000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Debra Hurford Brown","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101","altText":"Flying back into view ...

Not “the most romantic line from a film released in 1997”, or even “the most romantic line spoken while both parties were submerged in a large body of cold water”. More than one in 10 women surveyed thought the work of Shelley, Keats and Byron has less romantic resonance than Leo’s “Promise me you’ll survive.”</p> <p>Given that Kate Winslet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/02/kate-winslet-breaks-silence-on-titanic-raft-ending-he-could-have-actually-fit\" title=\"\">recently revealed</a> what we all know – that there was definitely room for Jack on the raft – the whole scene seems to owe more to <a href=\"http://www.thedramateacher.com/theatre-of-cruelty-conventions/\" title=\"\">Artaud’s Theatre of Cruelty</a> than Love Story. Yet a sizable proportion of us still reckon love is never having to say you’re sorry as you watch the man who painted you in the nuddy losing his lung capacity. It was the third most popular choice in the survey.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/02/kate-winslet-breaks-silence-on-titanic-raft-ending-he-could-have-actually-fit\">Kate Winslet breaks silence on Titanic raft end: 'He could have actually fitted'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The winner was “My heart is, and will always be, yours”, spoken by Edward Ferrars in the film of Sense and Sensibility which is, if nothing else, easy to remember. Next came Dirty Dancing, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_6ihSrpgvE\" title=\"\">Baby’s</a> “I’m scared of what I saw, I’m scared of what I did, of who I am, and most of all I’m scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I’m with you.” At least no one picked “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VyaXkK0I7s\" title=\"\">I carried a watermelon</a>”.</p> <p>Ultimately, it’s impossible to be objective about love. If any of these lines make us believe in a fictional passion, or leave us full of longing, or just make us weep for reasons we can’t quite explain, then they have succeeded, regardless of the beauty of the language or the true sense of the sentiment. However, I also reckon I could throw a rock into a library and hit a piece of prose that’s much more romantic than any of the lines that appeared on the survey. Here are some alternatives …</p> <h2><strong>From The Pursuit of Love by Nancy Mitford</strong></h2> <p>“It was like seeing somebody in the street who you think is a friend, you whistle and wave and run after him, and it is not only not the friend, but not even very like him. A few minutes later the real friend appears in view, and then you can’t imagine how you ever mistook that other person for him.”</p> <p>This is about instantly falling for someone and realising the love you feel is the authentic one that will turn your black-and-white world Technicolor. I adore Mitford’s suggestion that the sensation is accompanied by a feeling of “Duh! What was I even thinking before!?” It’s exactly how I felt when I met my husband. As though I was on University Challenge and Jeremy Paxman was telling me an answer that had been obvious all along.</p> <h2><strong>From True Romance by Quentin Tarantino</strong></h2> <p>“I kept asking Clarence why our world seemed to be collapsing and everything seemed so shitty. And he’d say, ‘That’s the way it goes, but don’t forget, it goes the other way too.’ That’s the way romance is.”</p> <p>To love, you have to hope. You sign up for spells of wretchedness, but still believe there’s no dying ember that can’t be coaxed back to fiery life with warm and gentle breath. True Romance is a gory accidental heist movie, but it’s also about a man who would do anything for the woman he loves (including killing her pimp) because he knows that no matter how tough things get, “it goes the other way, too”.</p> <h2><strong>From The Beautiful and Damned by F Scott Fitzgerald</strong></h2> <p>“Don’t say ‘wife’. I’m your mistress. Wife’s such an ugly word. Your ‘permanent mistress’ is so much more tangible and desirable…”</p> <p>This is about the vulnerability of love, and the sometimes suffocating need to be someone’s everything. Anti-heroine Gloria is appealing to her husband Anthony to keep looking at her anew, to combine the intimacy and tenderness of a long-term relationship with that sheer, shocked passion felt when two people are still exploring each other. For me, this line epitomises romantic love at its most selfish and impossible. We’ve all been there.</p> <h2><strong>From Parks and Recreation by Greg Daniels</strong></h2> <p>“I love you and I like you.”</p> <p>This line, spoken by character Leslie Knope while making her wedding vows, is one of the most romantic things I have ever heard. It’s about the way love is strengthened by friendship and respect. A promise to love feels grand and eternal, but vowing to like someone is a small act that needs to be practised every day. I feel so strongly about this one that I used it in my own wedding speech.</p> <h2><strong>From The Richard Burton Diaries by Richard Burton</strong></h2> <p>“After seven or eight years, I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef20e0f56459bc19e06281c2a456bb89ea2cf6d9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ef20e0f56459bc19e06281c2a456bb89ea2cf6d9/0_0_2280_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Burton’s words conjure up all that we can hope for from romantic love.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burton and Taylor’s enduring, complex love is well documented, but I think Burton’s words conjure up all that we can hope for from romantic love. To never get used to someone. To be separated for seconds and still think, “Hurrah, it’s you!” when you see their face in a crowd, even when you’ve just lost track of them for a bit at the supermarket.</p> <p>Most of us will hopefully never fully understand how it feels to watch our love fall from the edge of a life raft.

The socialist left is thus the true heir to the tradition of popular democracy.</p> <p>In the book with which she made her first significant mark, The Retreat from Class (1986), she argued that, without an organic connection to the needs and aspirations of working people, socialism becomes rudderless, a dream without an agent that might realise it. In tandem with the American historian Robert Brenner, she developed an account, most fully expressed in The Origin of Capitalism (1999), that rejected the standard view of the rise of capitalism as the product of expanding markets and trade.</p> <p>Critical instead were processes in the countryside such as the enclosure movement in early-modern Britain, roughly from 1450 to 1800, which displaced people from the land. Rather than conferring freedom, the rise of capitalism actually created a new form of bondage, which she called “market dependence”. Having deprived them of land, emerging capitalism forced poor people on to the labour market, offering them no choice but to sell their ability to work if they hoped to survive.</p> <p>Democracy Against Capitalism (1995) dissected the conflict between capitalism and democracy. Ellen showed that by legally relegating issues of property, ownership and work to the private sector, capitalism confines public power to electoral politics. In so doing, it empties democracy of its original meaning as the power of the common people, leaving workers precariously exposed to market forces. In order to counter this, she advised that we need to reimagine democracy as containing freedom from the dictates of the market. This would require democratic control by those who produce the wealth over the conditions of its production and distribution.</p> <p>In her writings on political theory, Ellen demonstrated how thinkers such as Plato or John Locke should not be seen as private geniuses contemplating timeless questions. She portrayed them as historical figures, grappling with the conflicts over property, power and justice that defined their societies.</p> <p>Her approach was dubbed “political Marxism” by the French historian Guy Bois, and it was true that Ellen gave a greater emphasis to social and political conflicts than many Marxist historians did. She had reservations about the term: she accepted that political economy and economic developments mattered, but merely argued that on their own they did not explain great historical changes, and that political events deserved greater emphasis.</p> <p>True to her roots as the child of Jewish socialist refugees from Latvia, <a href=\"http://www.versobooks.com/authors/263-ellen-meiksins-wood\" title=\"\">Ellen proudly positioned herself on the side of the poor and the oppressed</a>, celebrating those who have fought for a more democratic and egalitarian society. Born in New York, she was the daughter of Gregory Meiksins, an interpreter, and of his wife, the former Mischa Berg, a refugee settlement worker. The family moved to the west coast, where Ellen went to Beverly Hills high school and received a bachelor’s degree in Slavic languages from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1962, and a PhD in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1970.</p> <p>She moved to Canada in 1967, where she took up a position at York University, Toronto, and the following year married the political theorist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/09/guardianobituaries.highereducation1\" title=\"\">Neal Wood</a>. There she influenced scores of students, myself among them, and she became a Canadian citizen. When she retired in 1996, Ellen was inducted into the Royal Society of Canada.</p> <p>From 1984 to 1993 she served as an editor of the New Left Review, based in London, where she lived for several years, and she also co-edited the New York-based journal Monthly Review (1997-2000).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/09/guardianobituaries.highereducation1\" title=\"\">Neal died in 2003</a>. After five years together, in 2014 Ellen married Ed Broadbent, a former leader of the New Democratic party. Ellen is survived by Ed and her brothers, Robert and Peter.<em> </em></p> <p><em> • </em>Ellen Meiksins Wood, political theorist, born 12 April 1942; died 14 January

Black and gold ones, if I was offered the choice. This is because I often spent Sundays playing very active games of WWF wrestling in the council house where my brothers lived. On those days my name wasn’t Elen, it was The Destroyer, The Disemboweller or sometimes, Just Face It I’m The Best (I was the eldest, I could get away with that sort of thing).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f9f75c91861fbdb15f10ca7fdd335605b282f34\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3f9f75c91861fbdb15f10ca7fdd335605b282f34/0_57_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sibling fun!\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sibling fun with the Caldecotts!</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had fun – and bruises like a peach in a washing machine.</p> <p>Weekdays were different. I spent those with my mum in a house full of books, with a telly that had an off-switch. Weekdays, I was a middle-class, academically minded Matilda. I was only The Destroyer at weekends.</p> <p>Slowly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-site/2015/mar/24/my-inspiration-elen-caldecott-gillian-cross\">I came to realise</a> that boys like my brothers were missing from the books I was reading. The boys in books went to public school and cycled around Cornwall, or were sickly heirs to massive fortunes. </p> <p>Even in the gritty-realist YA fiction I found later, working-class boys were a mess – they were in gangs, or had alcoholic parents, or dropped out of school. They were victims of their social class. The sort of life I remember, scenes of snowball fights at the Rec, or of everyone piling into a parents’ car just for the joy of the journey, or of running into a neighbour’s house because your dad needed a Philip’s screwdriver and you’d been quested with finding one, were absent. They were not the right sort of setting for stories of magic or adventure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-site/2015/mar/24/my-inspiration-elen-caldecott-gillian-cross\">My inspiration: Elen Caldecott on Gillian Cross</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wait! - you might be yelling - there are loads of poor people in kid’s books! And you’d be right, of course. Harry Potter lives in a cupboard. Charlie Bucket can’t afford sweets. But think about the attitudes to their poverty in these books. Harry is rescued from typist Petunia Dursley and sent to an elite boarding school. Charlie ends up owning everything! The <em>values </em>expressed in children’s fiction (generally speaking) are middle-class: that education creates opportunities, and that fair play will be rewarded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/25/does-ya-fiction-need-to-check-its-privilege\">Does YA fiction need to check its privilege?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s actually really difficult, as a writer, to express different ideas. I’ve been taught these values, just as every reader has. After all, is there a more middle-class pastime than reading? Or a more middle-class career than publishing? (I heard a great story once about a copy editor changing “Is it, blud?” to “Is it blue?” in a manuscript set in South London. That correction says everything about the demographic of publishing.) </p> <p>I’m writing a series of books, the Marsh Road Mysteries, which has been praised for its diversity. But I’m carrying a shady secret. It has been much easier for me to write the middle-class characters than it has been to write everyone else. The Hampshire twins are solidly middle-class with private lessons, skiing holidays, a lawyer and engineer for (divorced) parents. And I know how to write them. The rest of the gang, I felt I had to research. I took pictures, filmed streets, wrote down overheard conversations. I worried about <em>getting it right. </em>I had no such worries about the twins, because their way of being is the “normal” way of being, in children’s books at least. </p> <p>So, if I were Queen of the Publishing World, there are changes I would like to see.</p> <p>I’d love to read writers who celebrate working-class values and voices. Thinking back to Sundays at my dad’s, there are things I’d want to share with the wider world. One is a strong sense of living in the moment<em>, </em>being impulsive. Want to spend the afternoon at the beach? Let’s go. Want to eat chips for tea? Put the plates in the oven to warm. Another was the closeness of the community, loyalty to family and friends and a sense that it was everyone’s job to mind the others. There was also respect for practical skills - someone’s cousin was always on hand with a spanner when the car conked out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jul/08/phil-earle-i-hate-my-books-being-called-issues-books\">Phil Earle: I hate my books being called 'issues' books!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’d also love to hear about the diversity of working-class lives. My experience was of a post-industrial Welsh village. But people are paid by the hour in all sorts of situations, from all sorts of cultures and ethnicities. I’d love to read more books like <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285013/\">Demolition Dad</a> by Phil Earle or <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/boy-in-the-tower-270751.html\">Boy in the Tower</a> by Polly Ho-Yen, which use working class homes as an incidental backdrop for larger-than-life stories. Widening our ideas of who can be in books will mean that we will get to hear previously unimagined tales. Is there anything more exciting than that for readers?</p> <p>We have an opportunity, now that diversity has become a key word in publishing, to broaden what books for children can be and who they can be about. I, for one, find that incredibly exciting. Spandex wrestling trousers all round! (at least in books).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a73384542455e0db7d3b24bae8dd35c5b2623e9d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a73384542455e0db7d3b24bae8dd35c5b2623e9d/0_0_1000_1535/651.jpg\" alt=\"Spooks and Scooters cover\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spooks and Scooters cover</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elen Caldecott is the author of How Kirsty Jenkins Stole the Elephant, How Ali Ferguson Saved Houdini and the Marsh Road Mysteries.

family member returning from an orgy? A collection of newly translated textbooks aimed at Greek speakers learning Latin in the ancient world might hold the solution.</p> <p>Professor Eleanor Dickey travelled around Europe to view the scraps of material that remain from ancient Latin school textbooks, or colloquia, which would have been used by young Greek speakers in the Roman empire learning Latin between the second and sixth centuries AD. The manuscripts, which Dickey has brought together and translated into English for the first time in her forthcoming book Learning Latin the Ancient Way: Latin Textbooks in the Ancient World, lay out everyday scenarios to help their readers get to grips with life in Latin. Subjects range from visiting the public baths to arriving at school late – and dealing with asozzled close relative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Great infamy have you accumulated for yourself … But now you don’t want to vomit, do you?'</p> <footer> <cite>An English translation of an except from the Latin text</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Quis sic facit, domine, quomodo tu, ut tantum bibis? Quid dicent, qui te viderunt talem?” runs the scene from the latter, which Dickey translates as: “Who acts like this, sir, as you do, that you drink so much? What would they say, the people who saw you in such a condition?</p> <p>“Is this a fitting way for a master of a household who gives advice to others to conduct himself? It is not possible (for things) more shamefully nor more ignominiously to happen than you acted yesterday,” the scolder continues, adding: “infamiam maximam tibi cumulasti”, or “Great infamy have you accumulated for yourself … But now you don’t want to vomit, do you?”</p> <p>The recipient of the attack is suitably chastened in the scenario: “I certainly am very much ashamed,” he replies. “I don’t know what to say, for so upset have I been that no explanation to anyone can I give.”</p> <p>“Roman dinner parties were not always decorous affairs; participants might drink more than was sensible and while under the influence might do things that they would later regret,” writes Dickey in her book, which is published tomorrow by Cambridge University Press. “The colloquia do not describe any of these scenes, but they do include a scene in which a character is rebuked for his (unspecified) behaviour while drunk. It is unclear what the relationship between the scolder and the miscreant is, though some type of family connection seems likely.”</p> <p>The colloquia show the language learners how to deal with getting to school late – a boy told that “yesterday you slacked off and at midday you were not at home”. He successfully escapes from censure by putting the blame on his very important father, whom he had accompanied “to the praetorium” where he was “greeted by the magistrates, and he received letters from my masters the emperors”.</p> <p>The Latin learners are provided with examples of how to deal with visits to sick friends and preparations for dinner parties. They are also briefed on trips to the market to wrangle over prices (“How much is the cape?” “Two hundred denarii.” “You’re asking a lot; accept a hundred denarii”) and an excursion to the bank.</p> <p>“We don’t know if they would have roleplayed the scenes with other students,” said Dickey, a professor of classics at the University of Reading. “But my hunch is that they did.”</p> <p>Dickey said the texts were very commonly used. “We know this because they survive in lots of different medieval manuscript versions. At least six different versions were floating around Europe by 600 AD,” she said. “This is actually more common than many better-known ancient texts: there was only one copy of Catullus, and fewer than six of Caesar. Also, we have several papyrus fragments – since only a tiny fraction survive, when you have more than one papyrus fragment, for sure a text was popular in antiquity.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Maledicis me, malum caput? crucifigaris!' translates to: 'Do you revile me, villain? May you be crucified!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The oldest versions of the texts exist as fragments on papyri in Egypt, where the climate meant they survived. Due to the size of these fragments, Dickey had to refer to medieval manuscripts from across Europe. “They have been copied and copied over many centuries, with everyone introducing more mistakes, so they’re not that readable. As an editor, I had to find all the different manuscripts and try to work out what the mistakes were, so I could get to the original text.”</p> <p>Dickey shows how the students had glossaries to help them get to grips with the new language, collecting together lists of words on useful subjects such as sacrifices (“exta” means entrails, “victimator” is a calf-slaughterer and “hariolus” is a soothsayer) and entertainment. “They’re definitely not the same sorts of words as we’d need,” said Dickey.</p> <p>There’s a phrasebook section on excuses (“You did what I told you?” “Not yet “Why?” “I (shall) do it soon, for I’m in a hurry to go out”), and a varied one on insults. “Maledicis me, malum caput? crucifigaris!” or “Do you revile me, villain? May you be crucified!” is one particularly vicious one, along with: “And does he revile (me), that animal-fighter? Let me go, and I shall shake out his teeth.”</p> <p>“When we think of the Romans, it’s mainly of the rich and famous generals, emperors and statesmen,” Dickey told the Guardian. “But those people are clearly atypical: they’re famous precisely because they were remarkable. Historians try to correct this bias by telling us about the masses of ordinary Romans, but rarely do we have works written by or about these people. These colloquia give us real, contemporary stories about their lives and I hope my work gives a fairer and truer vision of ancient society.”</p> <p>Insights into the intended readers’ times are provided by a scene played out during a visit to the public baths. Here, wrestling is followed by anointing with oil, before time in the sweatrooms and the hot pools. “Let’s use the dry heat room and go down that way to the hot pool,” one character suggests. “Go down, pour hot water over me. Now get out. Throw yourself into the pool in the open air. Swim!” “I have swum.”</p> <p>“We learn all kinds of things we didn’t know here. When they come from the baths, they take a shower and scrape themselves off with a ‘strigil’,” said Dickey. A strigil was a metal scraper used to remove dirt after an activity such as wrestling, and the characters have washed and swum since they wrestled. Dickey believes the only plausible reason for then showering and scraping is that their bath has made the characters dirtier than they were previously. “We knew the baths were dirty, but not that they were this dirty.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ghqy","wordcount":"1101","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e34266a8dc449703cf54afaddb1c19f589626d69/0_200_3876_2325/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Newly translated textbooks from the second and sixth centuries aimed at language learners also provide pointers on shopping, bathing, dining and how to deal with drunk relatives</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/ancient-greek-manuscripts-reveal-life-lessons-from-the-roman-empire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/10/ancient-greek-manuscripts-reveal-life-lessons-from-the-roman-empire","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"e34266a8dc449703cf54afaddb1c19f589626d69","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e34266a8dc449703cf54afaddb1c19f589626d69/0_200_3876_2325/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"CG","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/e34266a8dc449703cf54afaddb1c19f589626d69","altText":"The twelfth-century manuscript Zwettl 1, folio 11r.","caption":"How to live, the Latin way.

sun-drunk survivors of climate change","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In her debut novel, Claire Vaye Watkins continues a journey into the landscape and mythology of the American west that began with her impressive short-story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/07/dylan-thomas-prize-awards-and-prizes\"><em>Battleborn</em></a>. Since gold-rush times, California has been a draw for the restless, the hopeful and the desperate, in search of wealth, Hollywood stardom or just fruit-picking work: gold, fame, citrus. Now, in Vaye Watkins’ near-future setting, desertification caused by climate change has emptied it out again.</p> <p>Luz, a former model still smarting from the abuses of the industry, has turned down a place on a government “evac” to eke out a life with ex-soldier Ray, who is running from the authorities and the “forever war”. We first meet them squatting in the abandoned mansion of an LA starlet, with capable Ray organising the water rations and “shitting hole”, and strung-out Luz playing dress-up with the starlet’s wardrobe and ploughing through biographies of the west’s founding fathers. It takes time to work out just how far along towards the end of the world we are; in the book’s opening chapters Vaye Watkins keeps the reader as disoriented as her parched and sun-drunk characters, but the empty swimming pools and intense light conjure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jgballard\">JG Ballard</a>’s environmental dystopias as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood\">Margaret Atwood</a>’s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/claire-vaye-watkins-gold-fame-citrus\">Claire Vaye Watkins: ‘How come nobody’s ever having sex in the apocalypse?’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the majority of the population fled east in search of moister climes, what’s left is the hardcore of the California counterculture. “A little agony was just what this place needed,” reckons Ray’s friend Lonnie, who is stockpiling supplies to build his own small fiefdom. “Reintroduce hardship into the regional narrative. Sift out the posers and moneymen, the tourists, the sunbathers, the whores. Slough off the bourgeoisie! Euthanise the comfort culture! … Luz had heard it all before.” But Luz and Ray know they can’t survive as they are – especially once they have a small child to look after, the odd and possibly damaged Ig, whom they kidnap or rescue from an unsavoury gang at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road\">Mad Max</a>-ish bacchanalian gathering.</p> <p>So they decide to strike out not for civilisation, which would mean being separated and billeted into labour camps, but deeper into the heart of the deadly, magical west, towards a vast sand dune sea known as the Amargosa after one of the mountain ranges it has swallowed. There are rumours of an impossible town clinging to its fringes, run by a “prophet” who dowses for water. “Very spiritual place,” the two are assured. “Very primal.”</p> <p>Their journey, and what awaits them there, is both nail-biting and digressive, at times lushly overwritten, at times wryly incisive, but always powerful. There are sections told in chorus or set out as a play for voices, freezing the action at dramatic moments; quasi-documentary reportage as well as a fantastical primer to the “neo-fauna” of the dune sea: Mojave ghost crab, jelly scorpion, ouroboros rattlesnake. The whole is crammed with ideas that don’t entirely cohere; but one of the best things about the book is the way Vaye Watkins harnesses the real-life weirdness of the west to intense, hallucinatory effect. Abandoned talc mines in the Mojave desert become an underground prison town where thousands hide from the unforgiving sun; warning signs for future civilisations that were <a href=\"http://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/\">developed by the US government for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a> are woven into a chapter written in the voice of irradiated locals. “This message is a warning about danger … This place is best shunned and left uninhabited … Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.”</p> <p>Self-appointed prophets have been announcing the end of the world since records began. “There was always some saviour out in the wilderness,” sighs Luz. But what happens when the end times actually arrive? Vaye Watkins’ portrait of Levi, the leader of the sand dune colony, is a tour de force: chilling, beguiling, paranoid, convincing and pathetic by turns. Her father, Paul Watkins, was a member of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charles-manson\">Charles Manson</a> “Family”, and a haunted family history permeates <em>Gold Fame Citrus</em> as it did <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battleborn.html\"><em>Battleborn</em></a>, most obviously in the thread around motherhood, loss and the toddler Ig. “I believe every successful piece of art contains some pieces of its creator,” <a href=\"http://www.bucknell.edu/communications/bucknell-magazine/recent-issues/winter-2013/all-this-really-happened.html\">Vaye Watkins has said</a>. “We use our own lives to get at the story that cuts close to the bone.”</p> <p>Her novel certainly cuts deep, perhaps not in the end so much in its character portraits as in its vision of overwhelming natural power: the blinding heat of the sun, that saturates the book with light; the rock and dust of the endless desert. And most of all in her extraordinary creation of the dune sea rising above the earth, ever-growing, ever-moving, unmappable, unknowable, burying everything in its path. Too vast for human comprehension, yet at the same time a tabula rasa for each fragile individual’s desires, it’s a classic example of the Romantic sublime, as mesmerising as it is deadly.</p> <p>• <em>Gold Fame Citrus </em>by Claire Vaye Watkins (Quercus Publishing, £16.99).

Here are 10 literary highlights for the lovelorn","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Some relationships ebb away, petering to their end. There is loneliness and ambivalence after this kind of breakup, no doubt. But there is another altogether more visceral kind – the brutal, sudden and sometimes unexpected end to love, which is experienced like a death. For this, some serious heartbreak literature is required. The heroine in my new novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370607/\">Missing, Presumed</a>, suffers just such an emotional karate chop. Ghosting appears to be the modern term for it, though it’s as old as the hills. In Thomas Hardy’s day, someone would stop cycling to your village. Today, you can find yourself cut dead by WhatsApp.<br /></p> <p>In my novel, Manon Bradshaw is felled by the end of a relationship that had offered her great hope. She is 39 and once again facing loneliness, after brief respite. If I could hand her a stack of books to help her through the snotty-tissue stage, these are the ones I would choose.</p> <p>Books like these – which carry us through the worst of times – become lifelong friends. </p> <p>They offer wisdom in the dark, a voice saying you are not alone. And they touch on larger themes of grief and the inward-looking process of rebuilding oneself. They will hold your hand through the worst of it, my friend. Happy Valentine’s Day.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/instead-of-a-letter.html\">Instead of a Letter: A Memoir by Diana Athill</a><br /></strong>As a young woman, Diana Athill was engaged to an air force pilot, Paul, whom she’d met at the age of 15. Instead of a Letter tells how he broke off the engagement – he abruptly stopped writing to her, then two years later she received a curt note asking her to release him from the engagement so he could marry someone else. Paul died overseas before she could confront or forgive him. In a sense, this is a memoir about hanging on when all is lost. Athill writes elegantly about the shabby gentility of her childhood and her later career as a literary editor, but the drama here is in her frankness about the struggle to rebuild a personality taken apart by sadness.<strong><br /></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/13/top-10-failed-romances-in-fiction-anna-karenina-tolstoy-women-in-love-lawrence\">Top 10 failed romances in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/solitude.html\">Solitude by Anthony Storr</a><br /></strong>Did Beethoven compose great works before snuggling up in happy coupledom? He did not. While the world harps on about relationships being the key to happiness, psychiatrist Storr argues in this very kindly work that we pay far too little attention to some of the other great satisfactions of life – work and creativity. This book is a rallying cry for the irascible, lonely curmudgeons. We have stuff going for us too, says Storr, with much reference to psychoanalytic theory, and the twin human instincts – outward towards attachment yes, but also inward towards self-sufficiency and the kind of contemplation that can only happen when we are alone.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/319909/\">After You’d Gone by Maggie O’Farrell</a><br /></strong>This novel tells the story of Alice, a young woman in a coma. The story’s clever, dreamlike structure loops back into her past and the secrets held there. It has all the grip of a psychological thriller, but the writing is drenched in loss and absence. It’s the intense atmosphere of grief that stays with you.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/two-cures-for-love.html\">Two Cures for Love by Wendy Cope</a></strong><br />If you haven’t yet discovered <a href=\"https://readalittlepoetry.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/some-more-light-verse-by-wendy-cope/\">Some More Light Verse</a>, my personal favourite in this collection, you have a treat in store. Two Cures for Love encompasses meeting men, falling in love, falling out of it, not being able to decide whether you’re in love, struggling to improve yourself even though the outlook’s grim. The ambivalence on every page is doleful and humorous and real. Noting that men are like bloody buses, she writes:</p> <p><em>You look at them flashing their indicators,<br /></em><em>Offering you a ride.<br /></em><em>You’re trying to read the destinations,<br /></em><em>You haven’t much time to decide.</em></p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/jan/30/observerescapesection1\">To Travel Hopefully by Christopher Rush</a></strong><br />This memoir is the author’s attempt to reconnect with life after the cold wastes of extended grief. Rush’s wife – “the woman who had been at the centre of my existence for a quarter of a century” – dies quickly and unexpectedly from cancer, leaving him alone with two children. Rush descends into a desperate decline, in which he loses his connection to life, to literature and to himself. This account of a journey into the Cevennes, in the footsteps of Robert Louis Stevenson, takes him towards recovery and a realisation that the world still has riches to offer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To really be glad he/she is gone, revel in some 'Oops, I married a sociopath' literature</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jun/12/elena-ferrante-writer-italian-novelist\">The Days of Abandonment by Elena Ferrante</a><br /></strong>A novel about the derangement provoked by abandonment – not a sanitised kind of madness, but the real, dark thing. It opens with Olga’s husband walking out on her and their two young children for a younger woman. The unravelling of Olga’s internal world is as ugly as it is compelling, with terrifying jeopardy to the children and a dog. This is a book where the freedom and power of Ferrante’s anonymity is put to full use in writing that is driven by a ruthless honesty. </p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unless.html\">Unless by Carol Shields</a><br /></strong>Every novel by Carol Shields is a salve. The late Canadian novelist specialised in lonely misfits and the ordinary difficulties of human relationships. The mystery at the heart of Unless is why the central character’s daughter has dropped out of college and chosen to live on the streets. Like Solitude, its subject is the process of writing itself and of grief turning inward. And like Villette (see below), it boils with loneliness and rebellion against the “miniaturism” foisted on the lives of women.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/before-we-met.html\">Before We Met by Lucie Whitehouse</a><br /></strong>To really be glad he/she is gone, revel in some “Oops, I married a sociopath” literature. Before We Met is creepy, tense, and closely observed. Hannah is less than 18 months into her marriage and waiting for her husband to fly in from New York. When he doesn’t arrive, and his business assistant tells her she thought they were in Rome together – and then she finds her bank account emptied – she realises how little she knows about him.</p> <p>Thank God you’re not married, right?</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/villette-7.html\">Villette by Charlotte Brontë</a><br /></strong>This story of a lonely woman’s love for an unattainable man caused George Eliot to cry: “Villette! Villette! It is a still more wonderful book than Jane Eyre. There is something almost preternatural in its power.” I first read it aged 18 and was swept away by its restless energy – the way Brontë, as Virginia Woolf put it, expresses “untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted order of things”.</p> <p> Villette tells the story of Lucy Snowe – a cauldron of repressed emotion and desire. “Deeper than melancholy,” Snowe says, “lies heart-break.” This was Brontë’s last novel and for many her finest.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/326796/\">The Girls’ Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank</a><br /></strong>This collection of linked short stories spent 16 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list after it was published in 1999. Loosely at its centre is Jane Rosenal, a wisecracking single New Yorker who is suffering at the dating frontline and in some senses this book is a riposte to The Rules – a brutal and demoralising dating manual published five years earlier. Though shoehorned into the chick-lit genre by some reviewers, and inevitably lined up alongside Bridget Jones, Bank was also likened to Lorrie Moore for the gentle ironies in her literary style. Truly wonderful.</p> <ul> <li>Missing, Presumed by Susie Steiner will be published by  Borough Press on 25 February, priced £12.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370607/\">It will be available from the Guardian bookshop for £10.39</a>, with free p&amp;p.<br />Susie will also be taking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2015/nov/26/writing-fiction-spies-suspense-and-high-octane-storytelling-creative-writing-masterclass\">a Guardian Masterclass on creative writing on 22</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2015/nov/26/writing-fiction-spies-suspense-and-high-octane-storytelling-creative-writing-masterclass\"> February</a>. <br /></li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ghmv","wordcount":"1279","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9ae5f046e61dea8b86a0a49610cc0c09399cb826/439_623_5577_3344/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>If Valentine’s Day is an unwelcome reminder of what has become of your love life, you can find solace at the bookshop.

Either you have a mental illness or you know someone that has a mental illness. Remember: 1 in 4 people in the UK has a mental health condition each year. Mental illness isn’t some mythical beast, so when I heard Juno Dawson was releasing this book, I was pretty much ready to shove my money in front of a bookseller immediately.</p> <p>Mind Your Head is what I call a survival guide to mental illness. Alongside Dr. Olivia Hewett’s advice, Juno has compiled a guide to mental illnesses; covering everything from anorexia to anxiety in a less serious tone. We all have mental health, so surely we need to start looking after it?</p> <p>Mind Your Head is a book for two kinds of people in relation to mental health: those who can understand and those who can’t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"679a363276f663e54447bbff69a166047f4626fc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/679a363276f663e54447bbff69a166047f4626fc/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Mind Your Head\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For those who can understand mental health, this book will reaffirm what you already know and teach you what you don’t. You’ll find out about the various other mental health disorders which exist, and learn how to cope with or help others who may have these disorders. For example, I completely understand mental health but had never heard of OSFED (Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder) before reading this book. Turns out, it’s the diagnosis given to someone who needs treatment for an eating disorder but who is still within a healthy weight boundary.</p> <p>And for those who can’t understand, this book will make you join the other group, the group which I think you need to be part of. Mind Your Head approaches mental health in a lighthearted yet still serious way, and deals with it through an approach that seems to be subliminally telling you at all times, <em>It’s OK</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I really enjoyed this book and think it should be on everyone’s to–buy list.

They dream of rave reviews, of bestsellers, of respect and acclaim. And sometimes, as Alexander Chee does, they dream of their characters. Lilliet Berne, the protagonist of his new Queen of the Night, provided good fodder for reverie: she is, as the novel opens, a glamorous, feted soprano with “silences as famous as her perfor­mances”. Her “voice was so delicate it was rumored she en­dangered it even by speaking”. An anonymous composer offers what seems to be the role of a lifetime, until it turns out to be based on a past she thought she had outrun.</p> <p>“My editor said, ‘I worry that you’ll never stop talking to her, that you’ll be like that sailor who gets trapped and dies at the bottom of the sea,’” Chee said, meeting the Guardian in the cafe at the Center for Fiction in midtown Manhattan, where he works in the writer’s space on the eighth floor. “I worried about that very much myself.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature/2016/feb/03/literary-mixtape-alexander-chee-queen-of-the-night-beyonce\">Literary Mixtape: Alexander Chee finds a heroine – with Beyoncé's help</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If this sounds a bit fanciful, Chee doesn’t mind it. “It is looked down upon to speak in this kind of mystical way about things,” he said. “But there were times when it felt more like a haunting than a writing.” The character followed him – or rather he followed her – for the more than 10 years it took him to write the book, which arrived last week from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to rave reviews in the United States, and is already in its fourth printing. Chee even ended up, improbably, on Late Night with Seth Meyers talking about his 600-page historical novel.</p> <p>While in thrall to his character, Chee turned to other options in order to earn a living. He taught writing at Amherst College, Wesleyan University and the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and he published non-fiction in the New York Times Book Review, NPR and other outlets. </p> <p>His openness about the mechanics of publishing made him a popular presence online, too. He is a contributing writer at the literary website the Morning News, and also made frequent appearances at the Awl. He was, additionally, an early Twitter adopter, and <a href=\"http://lithub.com/nom-de-vie-literary-social-media-in-the-age-of-ferrante/\">has written frequently about the rewards and trade-offs of being a writer on social media</a>. Among literary writers he is so notorious an evangelist for online spaces that, he told <a href=\"http://www.themillions.com/2016/02/maybe-it-was-worth-it-the-millions-interviews-alexander-chee.html\">another recent interviewer</a>, one night at McDowell his fellow resident artists chanted “delete your blog, delete your blog” at him, over and over again.</p> <p>The fear of being associated with “lower” genres of writing seems to be a theme with him – as is the discovery that in fact these genres hold rich rewards for the writer. In a recent <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/128877/can-historical-novel-also-serious-literature\">essay for the New Republic</a>, he wrote that he found himself worried about being “tainted” by the low opinion of historical fiction, a genre that is now seen as filled with “silly novels” and shallow understanding of history. They run the risk of costume drama.</p> <p>Ultimately, Chee made peace with his endeavor because the subjects pulled him so powerfully. “I did not begin writing about these times and people because I already knew them or their hair, or their powders, their buttons – I chose them because they called out to my imagination,” he added in the essay.</p> <p>But with that realization came, he felt, the responsibility to do his due diligence when it came to research. “Really, as an American writing about Europe you have an obligation to do more,” he said. “Or at least I felt I did. They expect us to be stupid about Europe. I wanted to disappoint them. You do it all so that you don’t have the reviewer who says you don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p> <p>The first inklings of Queen of the Night came in 1999, two years before his first novel – a slim and contemporary bit of work – Edinburgh was published. Chee found himself collecting objects related to opera and especially the Queen of the Night, a character from Mozart’s The Magic Flute. He had the libretto, a famous postcard image with that title from set designer Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 19th-century photographs. “I went to Metropolitan Opera and there in a big case was this costume from the Queen of the Night,” he says. “I stood before it and it all just felt very charged, without me understanding why then.”</p> <p>Soon afterward, the late writer David Rakoff told Chee a story about Jenny Lind, the opera singer known as the Swedish Nightingale. Lind had retired early and then gone on a tour promoted by PT Barnum that made them both very wealthy. (Rakoff jokingly referred to her as “the 19th-century Cher”.) Chee quickly decided that a fictionalized version of Lind might suit as the plot of a burgeoning novel.</p> <p>Chee decided early on to focus first on the personal documents of women from the era – letters, journals, autobiographies, and then the work of writers like George Sand, Colette, Zola, Proust and Flaubert. Footnotes became must-reads for him, a surprising source of material. “I quickly learned that as a fiction writer you need the sort of details a historian or a biographer would find extraneous or useful to provide context via a footnote,” he said. “The explanation for the outsider helped enormously.”</p> <p>Chee flew to Paris to see a museum exhibition about the clothing of Empress Eugénie, spoke with professors about European political subterfuge, watched plays about the Paris Commune, read the letters of the singer and socialite Lillie Moulton. In the process, Queen of the Night kept getting longer.</p> <p>“I did too much,” Chee added.</p> <p>In fact, when The Queen of the Night came to the very brink of release in early 2013 Chee stopped because still more research had come to light. In the process of final fact-checking, he came across a new detail: the drama surrounding the career of singer Pauline Viardot-Garcia, whom Lilliet would have studied with. Viardot-Garcia was then collaborating with the Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev. Turgenev wrote the libretti and she wrote the music, “because he knew her voice was fading, and her piano talent was not using all of her intellect and talent”.</p> <p>Chee felt he would have to include the material. His agent and publisher slowly got on board, so that he could revise. “Their relationship then – one in which a woman is seen for her abilities and genius, even loved for them, more than for her beauty, became incredibly important to include in greater detail for she functions in the novel as a dream of what Lilliet wants for herself,” Chee said. </p> <p>In the end product, evidence of extensive research fills every page. In her glamorous new life – far from the overbearing mother that silences her and an ocean removed from her travelling circus – Lilliet rubs shoulders with some of the most famous figures of the time: Empress Eugénie and Emperor Napoleon III, the courtesan Cora Pearl, composer Giuseppe Verdi.</p> <p>But there is a personal element underlying all this research. Chee had sung in a professional boys’ choir. Even then, he felt it unfair that his own soprano voice would end, whereas a female soprano could have a longer career. “I was jealous,” he admitted. Perhaps the process of writing the book – the long “haunting”, as he puts it – became the best revenge.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gej7","wordcount":"1229","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/119936fc0c649328b859518b101faf6e75fe6d77/0_487_4096_2460/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-13T12:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>It

href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/31/opinion/1383233998_965346.html\">In a 2013 article published in the Spanish newspaper El País</a>, Vargas Llosa called the ruling by the Dominican constitutional court that stripped many ethnic Haitians of their Dominican nationality a “legal aberration” inspired by Hitler-era legal sentences that denied Jews German citizenship.</p> <p>Montalvo called Vargas Llosa’s attitude toward the Dominican Republic “disrespectful and offensive”.</p> <p>At the time that Vargas Llosa’s article was published, many Dominicans staged protests in the country burning copies of the author’s book Feast of the Goat, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961.</p> <p>The publication of the novel in 2000 was not entirely well received in the Dominican Republic because many felt it painted the country in a dim light.</p> <p>In a letter to the Dominican minister of culture Vargas Llosa said he was grateful for the prize. “The fact that, despite that incident, I am given this prize, speaks well of the democratic, tolerant and open spirit that luckily seems to prevail in the country.”</p> <p>Dominican author Junot Díaz, whose novel The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao won the 2008 Pulitzer, was also heavily criticised for speaking out against the constitutional court’s decision and what he called the persecution of immigrants – mainly Haitians – in the Dominican Republic.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/25/junot-diaz-author-dominican-republic-haiti-immigration\">He was called “anti-Dominican” by the Dominican Republic’s consul in New York</a>, who also stripped Díaz of the order of merit award given to him in 2009.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ghg4","wordcount":"419","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d1df99890bbccdbeda834018645e85f7df042929/0_68_3500_2102/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-13T10:30:25Z","standfirst":"<p>Politicians

Most households have one, lurking at the back of a drawer or the bottom of a sewing basket, and most children have rooted around in it, choosing favourites among the contents or playing with them as tokens. To the memoirist and historian Lynn Knight they are tokens of a different kind, recalling the old clothes they were made to fasten and embellish, the housewives and mothers who made and wore those clothes, and the lives they contained.</p> <p>Inspired by her own shimmering box of toggles, clasps and buckles, Knight takes us on an ingenious tour of domestic and social history over the last century or so: a 1914 thimble makes her think of the “munitionettes” of the Great War, a Land Army button of the second world war, a jet button prompts thoughts of mourning, a suspender clasp of sex, the pearl buttons from a baby’s dress of her mother’s adoption in the 1930s and of other foundling histories. It is to do with class as much as gender, for this writer anyway: her collection comes from a great-grandmother who ran a corner shop in working-class Chesterfield at the turn of the 20th century; a great-aunt who was a low-budget snazzy dresser; and a mother who craved a bit of glamour in the postwar provinces. From this core of very personal material, Knight writes more generally of ordinary women’s lives and changing prospects over three generations, of clothes as self-expression, as defiance, as entertainment, as evidence of frugality and frivolity all rolled into one.</p> <p>We follow her through drab years of shifts, smocks and aprons for poor housewives, to the “white-blouse revolution” of clerical workers in the late 19th century, the service uniforms and “good little suit” of wartime, then on to Hollywood-inspired sequin dreams – history told through haberdashery. Knight trims her story with wonderful bits of arcane clothes-related information: who’d have known that “lazy tongs” were a necessary accessory for the Edwardian straight-fronted corset, enabling the wearer to pick up items they couldn’t bend to reach; or that some employers in the 1960s issued their mini-skirted underlings with “modesty boards” (placed across the lap) to prevent male colleagues from getting too distracted? And who knew that most corsets and trousseau items used to be made by nuns, or that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/20/stevenmorris\">Amy Johnson</a> was dressed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/24/elsa-schiaparelli-biography-meryle-secrest-review-lobsters-fizz-fashion\">Schiaparelli</a> on her record-breaking 1936 flight to Cape Town? Sewing may never have been much of an aphrodisiac (the Other Woman never knits), but apparently it had contraceptive value, providing a common stalling tactic among working-class wives: “I’ll be up when I’ve just finished darning these thousand socks”.</p> <p>Then there are all the things one knew but had forgotten, such as the fact that bathing suits were commonly home-knitted and hairy, that elastic was made to snap and stockings droop, that within living memory drapers, not chemists, were the purveyors of sanitary towels (discretely disguised in brown paper) and that the minimum order for personalised name tapes was always about 10 times too many. “All over the country”, Knight remarks wryly, “a lifetime’s name tapes exist in buff-coloured packets pushed to the backs of drawers.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bf4edcf62425239bd7ab92f4b690ed8f0f70dd0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7bf4edcf62425239bd7ab92f4b690ed8f0f70dd0/0_0_2816_1912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in a mini-skirt attracts male attention on Carnaby Street, London, in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnaby Street, London, in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Graves/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Knight doesn’t have to look very far back to the days when domestic needlework was required of all girls and women on a daily basis, regardless of whether they were any good at it, when sheets and shirts were mostly made at home and the default position for a female was to have a needle in her hand, especially in hours of leisure. As more women got jobs outside the home, the market for ready-made clothes boomed, though Knight tells us that mass-produced clothes were initially thought of as a shoddy stopgap. They were disapproved of on moral grounds too: women who were liberated from the drudgery of domestic sewing had dangerously “increased opportunity for idleness”.</p> <p>Conditions in the sweatshops producing these garments for working women were famously awful. When the social reformer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/19/beatrice-webb-tribute\">Beatrice Webb</a> went undercover to investigate them in 1887 she saw for herself how almost impossibly hard the women worked, how it was not enough to be skilful, one had to be unflaggingly efficient in order to earn a pittance. Even so, Knight reports that many seamstresses preferred their lives to being in service; bowed over a machine all day, or finishing buttonholes in inadequate light, at least your thoughts were your own.</p> <p>The colourful box of buttons can often be a reminder of lives constrained and reduced, of women being stitched up by “stitchery”, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/17/diaries-little-grey-rabbit-uttley\">Alison Uttley</a> (the children’s writer who had trained as a physicist) disparagingly called it. Was the New Look in the 50s, with its shockingly extravagant yardage of cloth, a fabulous emancipation after the stringencies of wartime rationing, or was it profoundly retrograde, an example of irrational waste that offered the spectacle of young women as “caged birds”? Knight doesn’t seem quite decided on the issue, unlike the ladies of her home town in 1948, as reported by a wonderful headline in the Derbyshire Times: “The ‘New Look’: Chesterfield Women ‘Just Not Interested’”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b809e1aa934c6489638f30f096bb729a7e73f2f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2b809e1aa934c6489638f30f096bb729a7e73f2f/0_0_4200_4164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers in the Biba store on Kensington high street, London,  in 1967\" width=\"1000\" height=\"991\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers in the Biba store on Kensington high street, London, in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Fashions come and go but women’s memories endure of the clothes they have loved, longed for and been denied,” Knight says. I tend to remember sartorial disasters better than triumphs, but perhaps there were just more of them. Knight has clearly had a very happy relationship with clothes all her life, and loves to think and talk about their look and feel. She says that many women remember what they paid for a rite-of-passage outfit, and she herself remembers all her best items of teen finery, down to the last choker and pair of crushed-velvet flares. She inspected her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/02/sindy-doll-50th-birthday-relaunch-pedigree-toys\">Sindy</a>’s wardrobe with an already professional eye, it seems, and evokes it so passionately you can almost smell the pungent plastic limbs of “the doll you love to dress”. There is a particular sort of enjoyment in having someone trigger these material memories so deftly; Knight’s paean to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/211768\">Biba</a> will rekindle in many a middle-aged heart happy memories of the bilberry-tinted emporium, just as her evocation of popular 50s cotton prints, with their Eiffel Towers, poodles and pagodas will stir up pictures of forgotten summer frocks, peg bags and aprons. This sort of history-telling, associative and personal, can often slide towards sentimentality; fortunately, Knight is a lively minded writer who is never mawkish about her own past; for her it is full of things she knows she has in common with her readers and ardently wishes to share.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/372452/s/the-button-box//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Button Box</a></em><strong> </strong>for £12.79 (RRP £15.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/372452/s/the-button-box//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Her Name by James Dawson – review","trailText":"<strong>ABitCrazy: </strong>‘a good horror book’","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Bobby is at boarding school and it’s Halloween; she and her friends are hanging out and telling ghost stories, until Bobby and her friend, Naya, get dared to summon Bloody Mary – the girl everyone talks about, no–one believes in and who died at Piper’s Hall School for Young Ladies, the very same school that Bobby and Naya board at. Of course Bloody Mary is just a ghost story, so when told to chant her name five times in front of a candle–lit mirror at midnight, Bobby and Naya think nothing of it. However, this is a mistake, because the ritual changes their lives forever; she comes for them in the dark, in their dreams, in reflections… she’s everywhere. </p> <p>This book came out a couple of years ago and I’ve wanted to read it ever since it came out because I thought it seemed really interesting and haven’t read many horror books. </p> <p>It’s complicated how scared I actually was because I wasn’t scared as such, more paranoid. When my sister saw what I was reading, the first thing she did was chant Bloody Mary’s name in front of my mirror and although it wasn’t midnight, there weren’t candles and she only said it three times, I still got really paranoid. It’s not because I believed that it was actually real – I know that it’s just a work of fiction – but I thought, why risk the fact that it could be true? It’s not necessary to say someone’s name in front of a mirror at midnight in candlelight, because nothing will come of it anyway and you would have just wasted your time and a few hours of sleep!</p> <p>Anyway… I think I’m probably a bit too old for this book now, as it didn’t scare me. However, I think it is well–written and I can imagine myself at 11 or 12 being scared by this book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\"

height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think that the characters were really good because there was a wide selection of different personalities, which kept the book interesting.</p> <p>There was also a love interest which was really good!<br /></p> <p>I think that the historical part of the story; the history behind Mary Worthington AKA Bloody Mary was really interesting and the way that you found out about what happened to her was really well done.</p> <p>Although the book was probably a bit young for me by the time I read it, I was still compelled and made myself keep reading it because I was desperate to know what was going to happen next. </p> <p>If you want to read this book or if you like horror books then I would suggest you do, because it was quite a good horror book, it just wasn’t my kind of thing unfortunately.</p> <p>2.5/5 stars. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
