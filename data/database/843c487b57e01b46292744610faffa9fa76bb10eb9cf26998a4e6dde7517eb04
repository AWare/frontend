As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

the Stones are headlining after all. But never fear: if you've run out of sympathy for the old devils, alternatives abound","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-04T05:01:22Z","body":"<p>If it's anything like their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/nov/26/rolling-stones-o2-arena-review\" title=\"\">flatly brilliant 50th anniversary shows</a> last year, the Rolling Stones' success in the Saturday night slot at Glastonbury looks guaranteed.</p><p>Anyone who enjoyed the guest appearances by former members may note with interest that Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings are also performing at the festival, on the Acoustic stage.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Stones are a slightly surprising booking for the festival. For one thing, Glastonbury famously doesn't pay the kind of sky-high fees that you can expect at similar events; and the Stones are famously keen on the business of making money. For another, you would expect the band to have started taking a rather dim view of festivals with an ostensibly hippyish aura to them around the time they launched into Sympathy for the Devil at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/may/17/woodstock-altamont-40th-anniversary-hippie-generation\" title=\"\">Altamont</a> in 1969.</p><p>Even so, perhaps the most striking thing about this year's Glastonbury bill isn't so much the appearance of Mick Jagger on Worthy Farm as its sheer diversity. You could argue that the main-stage lineup feels a little safe, majoring in mainstream guitar rock, pop-rap and singer-songwriters, with Kenny Rogers in the traditional elder statesman slot.</p><p>There certainly isn't anything there destined to cause the kind of controversy provoked by the appearance of Jay-Z or Beyoncé in previous years. But the sheer size of Glastonbury means you seldom get the most out of it by staying put in front of the main stage for the weekend. This year's bill rather invites you to head off and explore.</p><p>If you think the appearance of the Stones represents an unacceptable capitulation to nostalgia, you can always take yourself off to see post-dubstep stars <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/chase-and-status\" title=\"\">Chase &amp; Status</a> on the Other stage.</p><p>If you find Mumford &amp; Sons' brand of tweed-clad, bunting-strewn folk rock a little too twee for its own good, and the notion of them headlining over Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds too much to bear, then provocative and adventurous R&amp;B auteur <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/25/weeknd-review\" title=\"\">The Weeknd</a> is playing at the same time on the West Holts stage, an impressive booking, given that his next UK appearances are in arenas.</p><p>Furthermore, the experimental electronic duo Fuck Buttons – whose thrillingly intense music exists resolutely outside the mainstream, despite its <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/09511-fuck-buttons-played-in-olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">unexpected appearance during the Olympics opening ceremony</a> – will be over on the Park stage.</p><p>If Arctic Monkeys don't appeal, then you've got a choice of, among other things, disco pioneers Chic or Portishead, the latter a genuinely superb live band whose music has become ever more leftfield over the years.</p><p>Elsewhere, the dance lineup is strong (Disclosure, Rudimental and Skream and Benga) while the festival's take on pop tends to the admirably skewed: Beyoncé's younger sister Solange  and AlunaGeorge are artists unafraid to experiment. Hip-hop is never normally Glastonbury's strongest suit, but this year it variously boasts Nas, Azaealia Banks and the Odd Future frontman Tyler, The Creator – as well as the dancehall act Major Lazer.</p><p>You'd be hard pushed to argue the lineup is anything other than eclectic: armed with a certain resolve and a willingness to tramp around the vast site, you can always get what you want, whatever Saturday night's headliners may tell you.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013 lineup proves: you can always get what you want","trailText":"<p>So, the Stones are headlining after all.

We've tried or talked about getting the Rolling Stones to play Glastonbury throughout my entire life – I can't remember a year it hasn't been wished upon.\"</p><p>The band, who last year marked their 50th anniversary with concerts in London, New York and New Jersey, will be Glastonbury's headline act on Saturday night.</p><p>They are the biggest name in a bill that will also see Arctic Monkeys headlining on Friday and Mumford &amp; Sons taking to the Pyramid stage on Sunday. Other names on the main stage include Dizzee Rascal, Primal Scream, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Elvis Costello, Rita Ora and man of the moment Ben Howard, the winner of best breakthrough and best male solo artist at last month's Brit awards.</p><p>Around 200 performers have been announced for the festival but it is three words – the Rolling Stones – which leap out from the list.</p><p>The rumour mill has been at full throttle since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/16/keith-richards-glastonbury\" title=\"\">Keith Richards last year said there would be more to come</a> after the band's five 50th anniversary concerts in London and the US.</p><p>He told BBC 6 Music: \"On a good day, if the weather's fine, [Glastonbury] is an interesting proposition.\"</p><p>Then in February Ronnie Wood said he would twist his bandmates' arms until they agreed to play Glastonbury. He told journalists: \"Wouldn't it be nice. We've got a meeting next month and that's going to be my first question to them. It's something I've always been interested in. I'm going to twist their arms.\"</p><p>Evidently it worked. Mick Jagger said on Wednesday: \"Can't wait to play Glastonbury. I have my wellies and my yurt.\"</p><p>Wood said: \"I've been using all my persuasive charm on the boys for a few weeks now, really pleased to be doing it, can't wait to be getting out on that stage at Worthy Farm.\"</p><p>Richards said: \"We all had such a ball last year, and the energy between the band is so good, we can't wait to play Glastonbury, see you on a summer's day in England.\"</p><p>Eavis said it had been a \"straightforward booking\". Of the rumours, some of which have been of the \"it's on, it's off' variety, Eavis said: \"It's rumoured every year, but we've never even really had a serious conversation about it until this year.</p><p>\"It is a major coup for us and it so exciting to be able to say they are playing, it is such an honour to have them. I get the sense they are excited too, there's been a real buzz about it from both camps.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Some final tweaking going on here at the farm... <a href=\"http://t.co/8fhoiYl5HZ\" title=\"http://twitter.com/emilyeavis/status/316978567550484482/photo/1\">twitter.com/emilyeavis/sta…</a></p><p>&mdash; Emily Eavis (@emilyeavis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilyeavis/status/316978567550484482\">March 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>She said getting the Stones was the kind of thing that kept her awake at night, thinking: \"God, if this is possible we've really got to try to make it happen. It has seemed such a shame that they haven't done Glastonbury but we had to wait until they were ready for it. This is the right time, the right time for them and the right time for us.\"</p><p>This year's festival sold out in record time, an almost absurd one hour and 40 minutes after tickets went on sale last October. About 135,000 people will attend.</p><p>Arctic Monkeys, who are expected to release their fifth album this year, are returning to Worthy Farm after last appearing in 2007. Eavis said she was delighted they were back: \"They are one of our great British bands.\"</p><p>On the Sunday night it will be Mumford &amp; Sons, which is particularly pleasing, said Eavis, because it was only four years ago that they were playing at 11am on the Park stage. \"That's always really exciting and really important for us to have those bands coming through to do these huge slots and make that transition to becoming a headlining band. It has been an important part of our history.\"</p><p>Eavis said it felt \"particularly British\" this year, in contrast to previous years that have seen big American headliners such as Beyoncé in 2011, Scissor Sisters and Stevie Wonder in 2010, Jay-Z in 2008 and the Killers in 2007.</p><p>In the acoustic tent this year will be artists including Sinead O'Connor, Martha Wainwright, KT Tunstall, Lucinda Williams, Stevie Winwood and the Proclaimers.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-402590597\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>One unquestionably big US star will be there on Sunday, however, with country and western giant Kenny Rogers filling the teatime slot, possibly with guests.

Punters tents are being erected in some quite literally ludicrous places (seriously, you travel overnight and queue from 5am so you can camp near the toilets in the dance field?!). And the cider bus is already doing good business. It can only mean that Glastonbury festival is officially open.</p> <p>We arrived last night to check out the calm before the storm but there wasn't much to report truth be told. Various traders were frantically filling up tiny pots of ketchup or having a final staff meal before the madness begins, but it's today they've all been gearing up towards. The gates opened just after 7am, which meant nobody had much of a wait (aside from the dozen or so people who arrived last night and were told they'd have to sleep under the stars, as erecting tents outside is banned).</p> <p>Christian, 29, travelled down from Leeds on a coach that left at 1am. &ldquo;It was definitely a good idea,&rdquo; he says, moments after entering the festival with enough bags for a dozen people. &ldquo;Now we just need to get to Pennard Hill, stake our claim, and see how our shoulders are for the next four hours!&rdquo;</p> <p>Rachel, from Liverpool, is also in celebratory mood. And not just because she turned 22 today: &ldquo;I'm so pleased we got here early. We're going to get a campsite high up on a hill so no rain can get us!&rdquo; she says.</p> <p>Oh, and for those of you wondering who will be coming to Glastonbury and not watching the Rollings Stones, meet Lindsey, who is 26 and here to spend her Saturday night with Chase and Status. &ldquo;We're all going to miss the Rolling Stones,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I'm completely apathetic about them!&rdquo;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0779b304-8dc7-409b-814e-f10a526f6b33\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372236326976/0207f7f5-9843-4943-b63d-5e9f088f07c3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Glastonbury arrivals Wednesday\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Laura, 25, Tom, 25, and Lyndsey, 26, arrive at Glastonbury.

It came from&nbsp;a documentary about&nbsp;a porn star. In it, she was crying, not because she had been raped, but because the scene she had just done was so emotionally intense, she was feeling full. And the documentary turned it into something very evil, like she had been a victim. And I hate when women are turned into victims like that. I was thinking, \"She's not a victim, she knows exactly what she's doing.\" She's actually, I thought, really impressive. There's a line in the song which is exactly what she said: \"I took a beating today, and that was the best thing I ever had.\" It was interesting to think that desire was coming from awkward places and not necessarily from the twee, obvious things that we think are feminine, but aren't. I like twisted, original desires. To twist that thing is very important, because it's the existence of life.</p> </blockquote> <p>The problem with that, I think, is that in a pornified society, where so many \"erotic\" images are about degrading women, where gonzo porn shows appalling things being done in the name of allowing a man in his home to crack one off, to have a strong, feminist woman to apparently endorse this &ndash; to specifically apparently endorse the abuse of women in pornography &ndash; sends out all sorts of confusing messages to both young women and young men.

Here's a choice passage:</p> <blockquote> <p>You pick your Friday headliner according to the mood. Chic turn the West Holts field into an open-air disco, delivering million-selling hits with the regularity of a jukebox, including ones that guitarist Nile Rodgers made with the likes of Diana Ross and David Bowie, although not, disappointingly, Daft Punk's Get Lucky. After the rough treatment it suffered at the hands of Professor Green earlier in the day, that song deserved a more dignified airing. For indie-rock business as usual there's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/arcticmonkeys\">Arctic Monkeys</a> on the Pyramid stage. They sound confident and powerful but still lack that instinctive bond between band and crowd that makes a truly great headliner.</p> <p>The smaller crowd at the Other stage confirms that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/portishead\">Portishead</a> are a strong-black-coffee kind of band. They're not for everybody, but hit the spots nobody else can. Having come a long way from the smoky hip-hop noir of 1990s debut <em>Dummy</em>, the Bristol band are formidable musicians who can turn on a dime from tremulous torch songs (Roads) to roaring post-punk techno (Chase the Tear) without losing momentum. There's even a political moment, during the brutally heavy Machine Gun, when the video screens broadcast anti-Trident slogans and, in an unexpectedly comic touch, the face of David Cameron firing lasers from his eyes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cf159fe4b042dd8f04a068\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-29T18:13:04.931+01:00\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tweet updates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1.

Even Glastonbury suffers from these old, tasteless stalwarts. But the benefit of a tented city is the scope for change. Over the last few years imaginative vendors have been re-inventing the meal in the valleys of Worthy Farm. This year I've made it my mission to explore those stalls &ndash; those that brave new cuisines, or just offer top notch nosh on a rainy Thursday evening. On the Glastronomy blog and Twitter I've braved a new stall for every meal. So far I've discovered delicious raclette, crumpets sold by strumpets (or, at least, young women in the sort of clunky Moulin Rouge corsets that defy sexual objectification) and a Mexican joint that smokes its own meat onsite, in a dark corner of the notorious Glastonbury nightlife. Up next? Kedgeree with hot sauce perhaps. Or maybe a comforting tub of Anna Mae's Kanye Western macaroni cheese...</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-29T13:42:19.388+01:00\">at 1.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51cecad3e4b0b82bbd16d1f9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-29T12:53:56.134+01:00\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We've been doing a bit of snooping on Twitter to see what Glastonbury rumours are doing the rounds.

The after-gig destination of choice for Michael Eavis (and boy does he like to tell everyone about it) this den of shot-swilling iniquity is dug into the side of a hill beside the Stone Circle every year and entered through a tunnel. The queue is 20 minutes long, but once inside you enter a world of archaic folk stomping in a wood-swathed beer-hall environment. Visitors sit in banks along the venue&rsquo;s sides and climb up to a tiny slot in a tree trunk in a dark corner to order ciders and shots, while unamplified pianists and rowdy gypsy folk bands stomp and caterwaul their hour upon the stage.

As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

plans 250 hours of live music online and 34 hours of TV coverage with programmes on BBC1 for the first time","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T21:50:48Z","body":"<p>The BBC has promised Olympic-sized coverage of this year's Glastonbury festival with 250 hours of live music online and programmes on BBC1 for the first time.</p><p>The BBC's controller of pop music Bob Shennan said it would be the \"first truly digital Glastonbury experience\" with live coverage from six stages, including the flagship Pyramid stage, streamed online.</p><p>Shennan said the corporation had \"learned a lot\" from its experience covering the London Olympics last year, when the games were broadcast on 24 dedicated TV channels, and would be giving the four-day festival \"everything we possibly can … to deliver the best Glastonbury experience for all our audiences\".</p><p>A total of 34 hours of TV coverage – marginally up on last year – will be split across all four of its main TV channels, kicking off with The One Show on BBC1 on the opening Friday night.</p><p>BBC2 will be home to the festival's big acts, including this year's big headliners, the Rolling Stones, although it remains to be seen how much of the band's set the corporation will be able to broadcast with outstanding rights issues still to be settled.</p><p>The One Show co-host Chris Evans, a Glastonbury first-timer, will also present his Radio 2 breakfast show from the site, the start of 59 hours of radio coverage, up from 51 hours during the last festival in 2011.</p><p>Radio 2 will air 19 hours of music from the festival, with other coverage on Radio 1 and digital channels Radio 1 Xtra and 6 Music.</p><p>The BBC's presenting team will include Radio 1 DJs Nick Grimshaw and Greg James, 6 Music's Steve Lamacq and two of the familiar faces of its festival coverage, Radio 2's Jo Whiley and Mark Radcliffe.</p><p>Shennan said the BBC had a new four-year deal with Glastonbury organisers in place, beginning with this year's festival.</p><p>The BBC's controller for multiplatform across TV and radio, Mark Friend, said the digital landscape had changed significantly since the last festival in 2011.</p><p>Six streams of live music from six different festival stages will be available on mobile, tablets and PCs, as well as Virgin Media homes with a \"connected\" red button. A seventh roving camera will follow the BBC's presenters in the build-up to the festival on Friday.</p><p>Mobile users will be able to access the entirety of the BBC's festival coverage via the iPlayer radio app, which has been downloaded more than 2 million times.</p><p>\"Most people expect to get audio and visual content on their mobile devices when they want – tablet usage has quadrupled since the last Glastonbury,\" said Friend.</p><p>\"We are going to bring you all the action live as it happens with more than 250 hours of content covering more than 120 performances. Whatever people's tastes there will be something for you, all of this available live and on catch-up.</p><p>\"Just as we did at the Olympics and for the first time at a big music event, it will be available on PC, mobile, tablet and connected TVs, whether you are at home, work or on the go you are going to be able to get this stuff, making it really accessible and easy to find.</p><p>\"2012 was an unprecedented year of innovation for the BBC and set a new standard for live events.\"</p><p>Shennan, who is also controller of Radio 2 and 6 Music, said the BBC aimed to make the festival \"bigger than the sum of its parts\".</p><p>He said it would be part of a weekend of \"unbelievable live content\" from the BBC, along with the Wimbledon tennis championships and the British grand prix.</p><p><em>•&nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

But it sounds as if he is going to be getting into the spirit of the festival after all.</p><p></p><p>Rather than getting helicoptered on and off the site to play the show, the Rolling Stones frontman says he is planning to camp on the Worthy Farm site in yurts with his family next month.</p><p></p><p>The 69-year-old rocker told Q magazine: \"I've got nothing else to do on Glasto weekend, and I want to spend some time with my family and have a good time as well.\" Jagger revealed that his daughters Jade and Elizabeth are in the process of sourcing yurts for the family escapade, and hinted that they may even visit after-hours raves at Shangri-La: \"I don't need [my daughters] to show me the cool places to go. I'm sure I can find some places of my own that are much cooler\" – giving rise to the tantalising possibility that Jagger could end up dancing shirtless at 4am at house venue the NYC Downlow.</p><p></p><p>Asked whether he was worried about being hassled on his family vacation, Jagger said: \"Depends where I go. I think everyone will be pretty laid back.\" The frontman said he was no stranger to camping and had been with his own children despite earning millions – although the weather was a little less unpredictable than the UK. He said he had been \"on the beach with my kids in the Caribbean, but it's just the same as Brighton – there's just less chance of bad weather\".</p><p></p><p>He told the magazine, out later this month: \"We went camping all the time when I was a kid.
