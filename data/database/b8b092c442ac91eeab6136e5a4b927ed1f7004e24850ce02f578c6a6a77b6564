From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, 'Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody'.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\" title=\"\">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a> would recognise this moment. Now it is not the land his impostors are enclosing, but the rest of the natural world. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, nature is being valued and commodified so that it can be exchanged for cash.</p><p>The effort began in earnest under the last government. At a cost of £100,000, it commissioned a research company to produce a total annual price for England's ecosystems. After taking the money, the company reported – with a certain understatement – that this exercise was \"theoretically challenging to complete, and considered by some not to be a theoretically sound endeavour\". Some of the services provided by England's ecosystems, it pointed out, \"may in fact be infinite in value\".</p><p>This rare flash of common sense did nothing to discourage the current government from seeking first to put a price on nature, then to create a market in its disposal. The UK now has a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/\" title=\"\">natural capital committee</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a> and an inspiring new lexicon. We don't call it nature any more: now the proper term is \"natural capital\". Natural processes have become \"ecosystem services\", as they exist only to serve us. Hills, forests and river catchments are now \"green infrastructure\", while biodiversity and habitats are \"asset classes\" within an \"ecosystem market\". All of them will be assigned a price, all of them will become exchangeable.</p><p>The argument in favour of this approach is coherent and plausible. Business currently treats the natural world as if it is worth nothing. Pricing nature and incorporating that price into the cost of goods and services creates an economic incentive for its protection. It certainly appeals to both business and the self-hating state. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force speaks of \"substantial potential growth in nature-related markets – in the order of billions of pounds globally\".</p><p>Commodification, economic growth, financial abstractions, corporate power: aren't these the processes driving the world's environmental crisis? Now we are told that to save the biosphere we need more of them.</p><p>Payments for ecosystem services look to me like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since Rousseau's encloser first made an exclusive claim to the land. The government has already begun describing land owners as the \"providers\" of ecosystem services, as if they had created the rain and the hills and the rivers and the wildlife that inhabits them. They are to be paid for these services, either by the government or by \"users\". It sounds like the plan for the NHS.</p><p>Land ownership since the time of the first impostor has involved the gradual accumulation of exclusive rights, which were seized from commoners. Payments for ecosystem services extend this encroachment by appointing the landlord as the owner and instigator of the wildlife, the water flow, the carbon cycle, the natural processes that were previously deemed to belong to everyone and no one.</p><p>But it doesn't end there. Once a resource has been commodified, speculators and traders step in. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force now talks of \"harnessing City financial expertise to assess the ways that these blended revenue streams and securitisations enhance the ROI [return on investment] of an environmental bond\". This gives you an idea of how far this process has gone – and of the gobbledegook it has begun to generate.</p><p>Already the government is developing the market for trading wildlife, by experimenting with what it calls biodiversity offsets. If a quarry company wants to destroy a rare meadow, for example, it can buy absolution by paying someone to create another somewhere else. The government warns that these offsets should be used only to compensate for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" and \"must not become a licence to destroy\". But once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold? Nature, under this system, will become as fungible as everything else.</p><p>Like other aspects of neoliberalism, the commodification of nature forestalls democratic choice. No longer will we be able to argue that an ecosystem or a landscape should be protected because it affords us wonder and delight; we'll be told that its intrinsic value has already been calculated and, doubtless, that it  turns out to be worth less than the other uses to which the land could be put. The market has spoken: end of debate.</p><p></p><p>All those messy, subjective matters, the motivating forces of democracy, will be resolved in a column of figures. Governments won't need to regulate; the market will make the decisions that politicians have ducked. But trade is a fickle master, and unresponsive to anyone except those with the money. The costing and sale of nature represents another transfer of power to corporations and the very rich.</p><p>It diminishes us, it diminishes nature. By turning the natural world into a subsidiary of the corporate economy, it reasserts the biblical doctrine of dominion. It slices the biosphere into component commodities: already the government's task force is talking of \"unbundling\" ecosystem services, a term borrowed from previous privatisations. This might make financial sense; it makes no ecological sense. The more we learn about the natural world, the more we discover that its functions cannot be safely disaggregated.</p><p>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value – from love to greed – we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. Pull up the stakes, fill in the ditch, we're being conned again.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p>","headline":"Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all","trailText":"<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> Payments for 'ecosystem services' look like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since enclosure","newspaperPageNumber":"25","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344274678245/Gunnerside-village-Swaled-004.jpg","wordcount":"1018","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"394265264","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6511159","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Monbiot","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1784143","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-09T19:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/privatisation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/privatisation","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/ruralaffairs","webTitle":"Rural affairs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ruralaffairs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ruralaffairs","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"environment/rivers","webTitle":"Rivers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/rivers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/rivers","references":[]},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife","references":[]},{"id":"environment/land-rights","webTitle":"Land rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/land-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/land-rights","references":[]},{"id":"environment/water","webTitle":"Water","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/water","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot","rcsId":"GNL055772","r2ContributorId":"15660","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168161144/GeorgeMonbiot.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168160956/GeorgeMonbiot.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>George Monbiot is the author of the bestselling books The Age of Consent: A<br />Manifesto for a New World Order and Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain, as well as the investigative travel books Poisoned Arrows, Amazon Watershed and No Man's Land.

If they have no monetary value, their assumed value is zero. If their value is zero, then destroying them is harmless, despoiling them no loss, poisoning them no problem. For half a century, the green movement has urged greater awareness, more conservation, reducing our footprint on nature. Yet despite some limited successes, this approach has failed overall. Our demands on the natural environment are rising, not falling.</p><p>Valuing natural capital requires us to train accountants to value every tiny, implausible detail of the biosphere around us. Will it work? Who knows? But so far nothing else has. We pay museums and galleries to act as stewards of our heritage assets. Who do we pay to look after our natural assets? If the answer is \"nobody\", what result would we expect?</p><p>Valuing assets is one thing, but trading them is another. Monbiot's concerns about the prospect of a \"market\" in ecosystem services are well-founded. There is little doubt that if this government could find a way of doing it, it would but as Monbiot points out, it is almost impossible to do. Despite the risk of some bizarre kind of market emerging, valuing natural capital is still the right thing to do.<br /><strong>Alastair McCapra</strong><br /><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Landscape Institute</em></a></p><p></p><p>• Monbiot does well to compare the monetisation of ecosystem services to the enclosures of common land. What price the biosphere? Before we rush to financialise ecosystem services, or to counter this tendency with cries of horror about corporate greed, why not acknowledge that we don't yet know how ecosystem services – or biodiversity – actually work? Ecosystems have functional values in dimensions that science can measure. Surely the first thing to do is to demonstrate the dependence of all terrestrial life on ecosystems in a practical, measurable way that everyone&nbsp;can understand. It should then be obvious that humanity has a special responsibility in respect of the biosphere which cannot possibly be discharged by selling chunks of it to anyone.<br /><strong>Michael Dunwell</strong><br /><em>Staunton, Gloucestershire</em></p><p></p><p>• George Monbiot is making a big mistake in arguing for a market-free world. Demand for access to fragile areas for tourism and extraction of resources, combined with scarcity, creates a market whether he likes it or not. The issue is whether it is shaped in a rational way and how it is regulated. The creation of incentives to invest in the conservation of biodiversity creates the possibility of a win for communities (investment in eco-tourism and its community infrastructure), for nature (price denotes real value creating a disincentive to destroy), and for investors (income from bonds over time). Those following the mythical path, denying the reality of market mechanisms, create obstacles to sustainable conservation.<br /><strong>Jeremy Ross</strong><br /><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p><p></p><p>• When land is taken into private ownership, in effect duty-free land enclosure, the landowner levies a charge on all that that land produces. This means all who do not have free access to land but need to use it for whatever work they undertake have a portion of the fruits of their labour paid to someone who does not work. Monbiot reveals that the UK has a natural capital committee,&nbsp;an ecosystem markets task force which proposes to pay landowners, \"the providers of ecosystems\", for their services, either by the government or by \"users\". This would further increase&nbsp;the&nbsp;cost to society of almost everything,&nbsp;as most of our land is&nbsp;privately owned.</p><p>As the value of the land is determined by the community, why not tax the landowners for the use of it – land value taxation. This would resolve many&nbsp;problems, particularly speculation by those holding land in disuse to&nbsp;increase its value. This would encourage them to either use the land more profitably, or make it available for others&nbsp;to do so.<br /><strong>Mary Law</strong><br /><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• George Monbiot flits from being a hard-headed pragmatic green – pro-nuclear power – to dreamy romantic all too readily. His opposition to \"pricing nature\" seems very principled, the principle being of course that one day capitalism is going to up sticks and walk away. I disagree with him wholeheartedly, since capitalism seems perfectly capable of withstanding even the shocks it creates for itself. This must partly be explained by its readiness to exploit human or natural resources at less than their actual value. The greatest challenge \"greening\" society faces is to make us pay the actual value of what it is we consume, and if that means pricing rivers, so be it.</p><p>But long before that we will perhaps develop an effective system of paying for the embedded carbon in our goods, the exploitation of child labour, the true cost of our waste and even for the legacy of our current tenancy of this planet. The task is to \"commonise\" the commons, and make us all pay our fair share for our use of it. If we did that, such abominations as the Alberta tar sands, as much a part of \"nature\" as a pretty stream, would be less attractive to the money grubbers.<br /><strong>Colin Challen</strong><br /><em>Scarborough, North Yorkshire</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>• Anyone worried about George Monbiot's article on commodification of nature may like to read Antonio Tricario's piece about the global nature of financialisation or privatisation of common resources, in Red Pepper this month. And if you thought the free marketeers had learned a lesson from the financial crash of 2008, they are voracious in seeking new ways of making money. In other words they know the price of everything and value of nothing. It is sad that this began in Britain under Labour, but Nick Clegg perpetuated government policy when he addressed the Natural Capital summit in Rio in June advocating natural capital accounting. If you put a price tag on nature, you create a market.<br /><strong>Dr Graham Ullathorne</strong><br /><em>Chesterfield, Derbyshire</em></p>","headline":"Price of everything, value of nothing","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> If our ecosystem services have no monetary value, their assumed value is zero.

A true market  requires an open marketplace in which people can browse and pick between service providers.</p><p>This was the thinking behind personal budgets in health and social care, which allow individuals to decide how to spend their allocated money for support, and there are clear benefits to this approach. Those receiving certain health and social care services need more control and choice over who they are buying services from. For some services this already exists, with customers having direct access to providers. In theory, providers should also have direct access to a market of consumers which is rapidly growing. But at the moment, there is no coherent marketplace.</p><p>We need the whole sector to be thrown open so that the benefits of personal budgets can be realised. It should not just be the same handful of companies providing certain services. There are a great number of service providers who can help with the welfare needs of families, but today it is hard for people to work out which ones are more suitable. Individuals paying for care are left at the mercy of Google to find a good provider, restricted to seeing companies with the biggest advertising budgets.</p><p>Local authorities do their best to coordinate providers, commission care and help connect families with those who can help. However, when people find suitable providers it's hard for them to tell if they are any good unless an organisation is regulated by the Care Quality Commission. Imagine, for example, if you lived 300 miles from an elderly relative and wanted to help them access the best services for their particular needs. Even if there is plenty of local information, that's not going to help you work out what the best option is when you are miles away.</p><p>It's like looking for holiday accommodation or secondhand books back when all we had to judge them by was adverts posted in the local newsagent or on a library noticeboard. Today, there are lots of simple ways you can find out what people think of services before you buy or try them for yourself. Services such as TripAdvisor, Airbnb and eBay have revolutionised how we shop online. Anyone, anywhere, can see who is offering what and – crucially – what other people think of it.</p><p>An Amazon-style marketplace is desperately needed for adult social care and children's services. The benefits from a system like this go beyond giving people choice; it would allow the people using these services to get truly personalised help tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Councils could also use the service to plan for the future, identifying trends in what people are buying. Too often the state only knows what people really need or want when a crisis point has already been reached. Local and national portals giving information about health and social care providers would give valuable insight into new issues emerging on the horizon.</p><p>The public sector also needs a more efficient supply chain because of the cost pressure on home care providers for example. Small providers who don't struggle under the burden of large overheads should have the opportunity to deliver services directly to local users. The council focus could then shift to vetting and policing, in case problems arise.</p><p>With a open market, the role of the state could be as guardian and assurer of quality rather than the de facto service provider. If this change occurred then massive energy would be released into the actual provision of services from other sources.</p><p>This model of privatisation means that the state is still accountable for public safety and quality, whether that be child protection services or careers advice. Doubtless local authorities or NHS bodies will remain the preferred provider for many. But personal budgets could mean wholesale decommissioning of public sector contracts, freeing resources to focus on assessment, quality and better outcomes.</p><p><em>• Want your say?

As Shrewsbury faces the closure of its central post office and the transferral of its services to the basement of the local branch of WH Smith, John Harris visits the town, and others like it, to find out what the communities think about the creeping privatisation","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2006-07-06T10:11:16Z","body":"A couple of weeks ago, a letter-cum-leaflet was circulated around Shrewsbury, in which the Post Office announced new plans for its operations in the Shropshire town. By November, it said, it was aiming at shutting down Shrewsbury's central post office, shifting its staff elsewhere, and entering \"a franchise agreement with WH Smith, who will manage Shrewsbury's Post Office branch from their existing premises at the Darwin shopping centre\". As it turned out, Shrewsbury was not alone: there were identical plans for Swansea, Slough, Ashton-under-Lyne and Hammersmith in west London. Thus ensued a media bunfight: the Post Office talked about a \"partnership between two trusted organisations\", while the Communication Workers Union said the scheme was \"disgraceful and scandalous\", privatisation in all but name.<P>By way of assuring any sceptics that Smith's - which is set to house the new operation in the basement of its Darwin centre shop - was the right kind of company to take over the post office, the Shrewsbury letter paid tribute to the fact that that its sells \"a wide range of newspapers, magazines, stationery, books and home entertainment products\". If there were any creeping doubts about why dealing in paperbacks, rulers and pens should put anyone in the frame for handling parcels, letters and - oh, yes - large amounts of cash, the letter did not reflect them. Smith's, it claimed, had \"the customer focus, appropriate knowledge and retail experience to enable them to continue to provide a high standard of service to our customers\". Somewhere within those words, there perhaps lurked the belief that currently dictates whole swathes of our national life, once crisply summed up by Sir Richard Branson: \"If you can run one business, you can run any business.\"<P>For 53-year-old Barbara Davies, a nursing assistant who uses Shrewsbury's post office to pay her bills and do the lottery, none of this made much sense. \"I don't think they know what they're doing,\" she says. \"Why would WH Smith be any good at what the Post Office does? I actually thought the staff were being transferred, and they're not. It's just a waste.\" Sixty-six-year-old Peter Crompton, meanwhile, is only too keen to tell me about his wounded sense of civic pride: \"A town the size of Shrewsbury should have its own post office,\" he says. \"And anyway, I would imagine there'll be all sorts of teething troubles. Look at what the Post Office does - they're not things you can just get people in off the street to do, are they?\"<P>The fate of Britain's post offices is hardly the sexiest of political issues, easily maligned as the preserve of tweedy nostalgists, and a little too drab and functional to engage the passions of the kind of people who fret about corporate power. Yet it sits squarely on the fault line that defines so much modern debate - the questions of where we should draw the line between public and private, and when the untrammelled free market should be held at bay. For Conservatives - and particularly rural ones - it points up the tension between what remains of Thatcherism and their attachment to what might be termed the British Way of Life; for New Labourites, there is a similar disjunction between all their talk about the wonders of community and how that sits with the apparent belief that private is always better than public.<P>On the fringes of the news agenda, all this is bubbling away. In the House of Commons, early day motions (resolutions to which MPs can sign up, but that have no real parliamentary oomph) about the Post Office seem to appear on a weekly basis. Trawl the news archives, and you find a raft of stories about local post office revolts, not least when it comes to the actions of the UK's supermarkets: in 2004, for example, Tesco bought the T&S chain of convenience stores, turned them into Tesco Express outlets, and - to howls of complaint that included the voice of David Cameron, apparently cross that a shop in his Witney constituency was among the victims - promptly announced plans to close 40 of the post office counters that came with them. From time to time, such protests even come with the fragrant whiff of celebrity endorsement: in 2004, when the axe was taken to nearly half of London's post offices and plans were announced to close the post office on raffish Westbourne Grove in Notting Hill, signatories on a petition included Damon Albarn, Angela Rippon, Ruby Wax and Helen Fielding.<P>Under New Labour's watch, the Post Office has certainly had a very mixed time of it. Last year saw the closure of 1,352 post offices; in 2004, the figure was 1,278. Predictions of the demise of the letter and the parcel have proved way off the mark: the age of eBay and Amazon has meant that in the last six or seven years, revenue from mail has remained fairly steady. What has really hurt Britain's post offices is the fast decline in the kind of business that ties the citizen to the state: last year, revenue from \"government business\" - benefits, chiefly, plus things such as road tax and passports - dropped by &pound;168m.<P>Behind this lies not only our increased fondness for paying up via the internet and telephone, but the fact that some of the post office's most important roles seem to have been deliberately chiselled away. Benefit claimants and pensioners are now encouraged to open bank accounts, and the Post Office Card Account - the electronic replacement for the old benefit book, used by the remaining 4.3 million people who haven't been pushed into the arms of Barclays, Lloyds et al - is due to be wound up in 2010. As of the end of this month, the long-standing job of selling TV licences will go; that contract has gone to PayPoint, a private consortium recently hailed as \"one of the stock market's best performers\". By way of a counterbalance, 2003 saw the arrival of a &pound;150m-a-year subsidy to rural post offices (after the EU had kindly decided it did not represent \"unfair state aid\"), but that will expire in 2008. What happens after that is under review: as is the New Labour way, the official line from the Department of Trade Industry is that \"no decision has been made\".<P>Come the belated promotion of Gordon Brown, this would make for a very interesting political subplot. Which side of him will win out: the penny-pinching free-marketeer, keen to propel us into a privately run future cracked up to be somehow inevitable, or the moral communitarian who occasionally makes an appearance in his speeches? \"A town is more than a marketplace\" is one of his most oft-heard soundbites; that being the case, doesn't the red Post Office sign represent something more than mere business?<P>For his former ministerial colleague Kate Hoey, the MP for Vauxhall and chair of the all-party sub-post offices group, the auguries look pretty grim. She recently put down an early day motion protesting against the end of the Card Account, which has so far attracted the support of 366 MPs, though it does not sound as if the right people are listening. \"I personally think that there's a big move to say that the Post Office need no longer be in the public sector,\" she says. \"If you chip away at it over and over again, then what I think might happen is this: even though you have manifesto commitments that the Post Office will stay in the public sector, you've actually made it untenable.\"<P>The places soon to be subsumed into WH Smith are crown post offices, currently wholly owned by Royal Mail; in that context, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the plans represent simple privatisation. However, much of the ongoing disquiet surrounds the sub-post offices that make up 97% of the Post Office network, contracted out to small businesspeople and often run as part of local shops; the places that sit at the heart of the belief that the Post Office delivers a heartwarming public service.<P>Here, there is a huge ongoing revolt. On the face of it, the aforementioned Card Account does not earn post offices much money - they get 8p per &pound;100 cashed, though in ensuring that people come into post offices to get their benefits, it actually serves to generate revenue from selling other goods. When it goes, the Federation of Sub-Post Masters reckons, local post offices will lose 10% of their income, a prospect dreadful enough to have led more than a million people to sign a petition drawing attention to \"a vital service to communities in both urban and rural areas ... threatened by the government's withdrawal of services\". In Hoey's estimation, \"This is the big litmus test - if the government goes ahead with it, they might as well announce that they've no interest in keeping post offices throughout the country.\"<P>On the way to Shrewsbury, I stop at three sub-post offices. In Eardisley, a well-maintained hamlet in Herefordshire, 32-year-old Ewan Cardwell's business stands as a shining testament to the Post Office's belief that the people who run its services must now diversify or die: the post counter sits next to a shop that sells second-hand books, reading glasses, a small selection of DVDs and local maps. Next door, Cardwell's sister Briar runs a restaurant and bar at which her brother works the late shift; its licence now extends until 2am at weekends, after which he has to see to the pensions and parcels at nine the next morning. \"It's important we're here,\" he says. \"If the post office went, it'd be another nail in the village's coffin.\"<P>This morning, there is a succession of customers: passing lorry drivers, the odd pram-pushing mum, and a steady stream of local pensioners, at least half of whom do their business via the Pin machine reserved for the Card Account. \"If that goes,\" says Cardwell, \"it'll be a nightmare. Going all the way back to when they got rid of the pension book, I feel very strongly about the way we've been treated. Some of the letters sent out to pensioners [by the Department of Work and Pensions] have been really anti-Post Office, just pushing people away from us and towards the banks. The government seems to be against us, and I really don't know why.\"<P>Seven miles down the road in Kington, a market town whose peppering of vacant shops and peeling facades suggest an uneasy kind of future, there is a sizeable Victorian post office; the kind of place that employs a small handful of counter staff and has sidelines in Sellotape and Jiffy bags rather than cheap lager and ginger cake. The postmaster here is 51-year-old Paul Calverley, who recently chucked in his job as the head of development at ITV Wales, quit commuting to Cardiff and opted for a \"lifestyle change\". Yesterday, he tells me, &pound;10,904 passed over his counters in benefit payments. \"It's a lot, isn't it?\" he says. \"You can understand why the banks want a piece of it.\"<P>As things stand, he claims to make a reasonable living, bolstered by the money he gets from the Royal Mail for rental of the sorting office around the back, though when I ask him about the future, his expression rather darkens. \"The government is very good at talking about change, but it's very bad at managing it,\" he says. \"We know change is coming but we've got no clear steer on what the government wants the Post Office to be. At the moment, we're the one kind of interface that they have on the high street. But do they want that? I want to know where we'll be in five years' time.\"<P>The sentiments are echoed 30 miles up the road in Shropshire, where a post office serves Bent Lawnt, a settlement so small that it isn't on the map. Here, Christina Pickett has been the postmistress for 20 years, running the shop with her partner Jenny Jones, who sees to a grocery sideline whose most head-turning current special offer promises six cans of Carlsberg Export for &pound;3.50. On the post side, eBay has given them a lift and pensions and benefits are just about ticking over. They also set great store by the role that goes way beyond commerce: sorting people out with jobs and services, raising the alarm if a regular customer fails to show up. What bothers them is what might happen next. \"It sometimes feels like we're in limbo,\" says Jones. \"It'd be nice to refit the post office, but what are we going to be doing? I wish we knew.\"<P>Back in Shrewsbury, my day ends in a churchyard opposite the post office, sheltering from the sun in the company of an official from the Communication Workers Union named Jim Reeves, here to address the understandable fears of the 14 staff whose working lives are about to take a very unexpected turn. The WH Smith scheme, he says, is a new development - \"the first time that we've seen a major retailer get handed a significant number of post offices\". Those in charge claim there is \"no commitment to go any further\", although further deals are \"a possibility\"; the union suspects that what is currently under way actually amounts to a pilot scheme. As is so often the case when the public is turned private, the wages do not quite match up: from what he has heard, whereas a counter clerk employed by the post office will be on basic pay of &pound;18,000, WH Smith is offering between &pound;14,000 and &pound;15,000. (WH Smith responded to this with the claim that \"we don't discuss any remuneration packages for existing or new employees with anyone other than the individual involved\".)<P>Crown Post Offices lost &pound;50m last year, which, its management claims, makes outsourcing their sources increasingly appealing. In the words of a spokesman, \"Anything that enables us to provide the full range of services in town centres, we will look at. Partnerships are one way of doing that.\" Reeves gives that short shrift: \"It's Royal Mail that owns the Post Office, and last year they turned a profit of &pound;537m.\"<P>Just before I leave town, I pop back to the post office to talk to a few more customers. If it is easy to assume that everything we have been talking about is the preserve of trade unionists or pensioners or tweedy nostalgists, my last encounter provides a neat counterpoint. Seventeen-year-old Emily Bacon, a student with a part-time job at French Connection, has just been to the post office to sort herself out with traveller's cheques and holiday insurance before a week-long holiday in Magaluf. When I ask her what she thinks of the Post Office's plans, she looks perturbed, to say the least.<P>\"It's just stupid,\" she says. \"This place has been open for ages, and everyone in Shrewsbury uses it, so what are they doing? The people they're giving it to are here to sell books and papers, not handle large quantities of money. And it's unfair that people in there are going to lose their jobs.<P>\"It's good the way it is,\" she says. \"Why move it to the bottom of WH Smith?\"","headline":"Signed, sealed, delivered","trailText":"The Post Office is one of the few public services left ... or is it?

Unlike today, two generations ago, economics undergraduates were taught that such goods were different from soap flakes and hamburgers. Public goods and services are things which need to be supplied – or at least regulated – by the public sector because they are by their very nature collective. Clean water, unpolluted air, education and law and order are obvious examples; there is no doubt that everybody should have such goods, not merely those who can afford to buy them privately.</p><p></p><p>These days, however, the distinction between \"public\" and \"private\" has become blurred, and among mainstream economists the consensus appears to be that because the private sector is more efficient than the state, we should limit the public role almost entirely to that of supervision. In Britain, for example, the railways were privatised and an \"internal market\" was created within the national health service on the grounds that this improved the efficiency of service delivery for \"customers\". In the US, it has become common for everything from mass transport to prison services to be run for private profit. Indeed, there are some politicians who – as followers of the economist Friedrich Hayek – would abolish all forms of state supervision or control, and a few who would abolish all taxation.</p><p></p><p>Anti-state ideology goes back a long way, but its major driver in the last century was doubtless the Reagan-Thatcher revolution and, at a global level, what became known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a>, ie, the rightwing orthodoxy associated with the IMF and the World Bank. Among others, economists such as Anne Krueger and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jagdish-bhagwati\" title=\"\">Jagdish Bhagwati</a> helped popularise the notion that civil servants are really \"rent-seeking\" bureaucrats whose contribution to society is nil.</p><p></p><p>Market fundamentalism, the best-known US apostle of which was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/nov/17/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>, was developed inter alia by Thomas Sargent into rational expectations theory, which argued that markets contain all available information and are populated exclusively by fully informed consumers and producers for whom all future risks are calculable. Such notions provided the intellectual foundation of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/26/journey-from-keynesiani-economics-to-austerity\" title=\"\">anti-Keynesian, anti-state views</a> that came to dominate the profession.</p><p></p><p>For a short time after the financial collapse of 2008, it appeared that the Thatcher-era ideology of market fundamentalism – or neoliberalism as it is known today – was in terminal decline, but this view proved to be an illusion. While Keynesianism was briefly rolled out to save the advanced countries from total economic meltdown, once disaster was seen to have been averted most politicians returned to the dreary game of peddling austerity to the poor while helping the rich to prosper.</p><p></p><p>Nowhere was there more enthusiasm for this dismal sport than in Europe in general – where a transfer union was unthinkable and the welfare state was soon deemed \"unaffordable\" – and Britain in particular. Under David Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, privatisation is set to reach new heights as private companies bid for fat contracts to build and manage hospitals, schools, roads and whatever else can be hived off to the private sector in the name of reducing public debt.</p><p></p><p>Although there are some circumstances in which it is sensible to privatise, there are many good reasons why <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/19/private-overhaul-roads-terrible-deal\" title=\"\">wholesale privatisation should be shunned</a>. The first and most important reason is that abolishing universal free access to public services will make us less equal. For example, the notion of being \"equal before the law\" is a hallowed principle which goes back to ancient Greece. Few would deny that where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/11/roman-abramovich\" title=\"\">legal aid is denied to the poor</a> while the rich can evade it with the help of clever (and very expensive) lawyers, not only does this make a travesty of justice, but it also threatens social cohesion.</p><p></p><p>By analogy, a major reason for providing universal healthcare as a public service is that decent medical treatment should not be a privilege reserved for the few. Equally, because capitalist business cycles result in economic downturns, all taxpayers contribute towards funding unemployment benefit for those unlucky enough to lose their job during such times. When there are 10 job-seekers for every vacancy, \"getting on your bike\" simply doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>The same public logic holds for education. Universal literacy may be instrumental to developing a skilled workforce – a notion much loved by Tories – but the real reason we value education is because it is a necessary (though insufficient) component of a well-functioning democratic society. Education is not a commodity to be purchased according to individual preference; it's central to the meaning of civilised society.</p><p></p><p>What of the argument that the private sector is more efficient at running things because of competition? Although this may hold true for the production of many commodities (as we know from the sad experience of Soviet-style central planning), it is by no means a universal principle.</p><p></p><p>It used to be argued that publicly owned industries are necessary in the case of \"natural monopolies\"; ie, where long-term economies of scale in production make for \"monopoly profits\". It is only fair that government – through ownership or regulation – captures such revenues for the public benefit. Also, because natural monopolies (eg, water, energy, transport) typically require very large initial capital outlays, often the state alone is in a position to finance them. What has happened in recent decades to many public utilities is that, having been established and run by the state often with a strong element of public subsidy, they have been sold to private interests at knockdown prices on the grounds of fiscal rectitude (and with the blessing of the IMF).</p><p></p><p>Another reason for preferring public provision is where \"external\" costs or benefits exist. A contemporary example of such an externality is where an industry damages the environment. A private company might want to cut down swathes of forest to grow crops for biofuel, disregarding the long-term environmental impact. Such companies typically have short-time horizons – they must make profits for shareholders next year, not next century. Government needs to step in to take the long-tern environmental effect – or any other form of market failure – into account.</p><p></p><p>The notion that competition always makes the private sector more efficient than the public sector is therefore quite unjustified. Markets are not perfect, the future is uncertain, externalities are important and some goods and services by their very nature must be publicly provided. What politicians typically mean when they speak of greater efficiency is lower costs, typically achieved by employing cheap, non-unionised labour. This is the real reason so many public services are outsourced.</p><p></p><p>In short, arguments favouring private over public provision are not just theoretically flawed, but typically favour the few at the expense of the many. The pendulum has swung too far to the right: it's time to stand up for public provision.</p><p></p><p>• Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>","headline":"When privatisation doesn't work","trailText":"<strong>George Irvin for Social Europe Journal:</strong> There are many reasons to shun wholesale privatisation – but these days the concept of public goods is often forgotten","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/27/1332857399467/Hospital-surgical-instrum-003.jpg","wordcount":"1141","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"387928443","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5987569","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Irvin, for <a href=\"http://www.social-europe.eu\" title=\"\">Social Europe Journal</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/guardian-comment-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Comment Network</a>","internalPageCode":"1723473","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-30T14:41:13Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/27/when-privatisation-doesnt-work","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/27/when-privatisation-doesnt-work","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/series/guardian-comment-network","webTitle":"Guardian Comment Network","description":"The Guardian Comment Network brings you a selection of the best comment from our partners across the web.

Scarce public money should be concentrated on extending services to the vast population underserved by public supplies. </p><p>It's true that some privatisa tions have been disastrous for consumers. Many publicly owned services have been equally disastrous. Some of the best developments have been introduced where all stakeholders - consumers, governments and suppliers - have worked together to find solutions most appropriate to their communities. Often this means rethinking pricing, including how subsidies can be used most effectively to benefit the poorest, and whether there is an appropriate role for private companies. Aid should be directed at these community-driven projects and not at promoting specific doctrines, whether espousing the virtues of liberalisation or public supply.    <br />  <strong>Robin Simpson   </strong><br />  Consumers International  </p><p>Maurice Terry of Watervoice (Letters, December 2) raises the important issue of water affordability. Much of the problem could be solved if water prices were reduced by curbing the excessive profits of the water companies. Since 1990, the very modest shareholdings which my wife and I hold in Anglian Water have produced more in dividends and capital repayments than we have paid the same company for our water supply.  </p><p>For such a basic utility, it cannot be right that shareholders have benefited to this extent at the expense of users and investment. Perhaps it is not only in developing countries that utility privatisation should be abandoned?    <br />  <strong>Bob Booth</strong><br />  Leighton Buzzard, Beds  </p>","headline":"Flow of profits to the water industry","trailText":"<p><strong>Letters: </strong> Privatisation of services such as water is an emotive issue (Comment, December 1).</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"29","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/x6hq","wordcount":"315","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"5077296","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","internalPageCode":"24542","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/dec/03/water.guardianletters","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2004/dec/03/water.guardianletters","tags":[{"id":"environment/water","webTitle":"Water","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/water","references":[]},{"id":"tone/letters","webTitle":"Letters","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/letters","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/privatisation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/privatisation","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[]},{"webTitle":"Selling off RBS would defraud the public and damage economic recovery | Seumas Milne","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-13T10:49:29Z","sectionName":"Comment is free","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/13/rbs-selling-off-stephen-hester","fields":{"secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/2/10/1328898822184/Stephen-Hester-003.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3gh87","standfirst":"Stephen Hester has been forced to leave the bank by George Osborne in his determination to accelerate privatisation","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T22:40:53Z","body":"<p>Any doubt over who calls the shots at Britain's part-nationalised banks has been dispelled by the fate of Stephen Hester. The RBS chief executive has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/12/rbs-ceo-stephen-hester-quits\" title=\"\">forced out</a> at the behest of George Osborne.</p><p>Forget the arms-length paraphernalia of the UKFI holding company. When ministers want the bailed-out banks to do something, they do it.</p><p>That's as it should be, since the state (not the \"taxpayer\" as the media constantly intones) currently owns 81% and 39% of RBS and Lloyds TSB respectively. The problem is what they want to do with them – which is sell them off fast, regardless of the loss to the public purse or the damage to the economy.</p><p>The chancellor is driven by a mixture of <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/06/rbs-lloyds-ideology\" title=\"\">unbending ideology</a> and raw electoral calculation. He and David Cameron are determined to start the largest privatisations in Britain's history by the end of 2014 – just in time for a 2015 election.</p><p>The idea is to engineer a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nedVpG-GjkE\" title=\"\">\"Tell Sid\" 1980s-style</a> Thatcherite handout to the right kind of voters, while ensuring that the heresy of publicly owned banks is consigned to the nightmares of the 2008 market meltdown.</p><p>Hester, who now stands to pocket an extra £5.6m after more than 40,000 RBS workers have lost their jobs, was insufficiently gung-ho for the scale of early sell-off Osborne regards as critical to Tory fortunes. His successor will get the message.</p><p>Next week Osborne is expected to set out the kind of discounts he plans to offer for Lloyds shares. He's also toying with the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange's plan for a wider share giveaway.</p><p>For the Tory leadership, it's a trade-off between the appearance of a public windfall and the risk of being seen again to stuff the pockets of the better-off as living standards plummet. In reality, it will be a fraud against the public and an attack on genuine economic recovery.</p><p>The Brown government paid well over the odds to prevent the collapse of RBS and Lloyds in 2008. Now, Cameron and Osborne show every sign of selling the public stakes well below them, as they did with Northern Rock. No amount of dodgy breakeven accounting will hide the billions that stand to be lost.</p><p>But even more important, returning the banks to the private sector that brought them to the brink in the first place will throw away a decisive lever to rebuild and restructure the economy for the future.</p><p>That's not the way the part-nationalised banks have been run for the past five years, of course. The overriding political concern has been to prepare them for re-privatisation. Even now, RBS and Lloyds lending to businesses is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/03/business-loans-funding-for-lending\" title=\"\">actually falling</a> as a result.</p><p>But that's a political decision – and, as we've seen this week, it's the politicians who are in charge. RBS and Lloyds could be used now as a motor of growth and investment to reshape the economy, channelling lending to infrastructure, the sectors of the future and public housebuilding.</p><p>Private investment has as good as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/23/concerns-health-uk-economy-gdp-growth-ons\" title=\"\">collapsed</a> in Britain. But instead of using the publicly controlled banks to fill that gap, Osborne is in a frenzy to hand them back to the private sector, pumping up mortgage lending instead.</p><p>There's a wider case for bank breakups, regional banks and mutuals to create a finance sector that supports sustainable growth. But right now, use the tools we've got.

He did not have these concerns in 2002 when the government in which he was deputy prime minister  allowed private companies to run police detention and escort services. Nor when they allowed nightclub bouncers to exercise police powers to issue fixed penalty notices. He asks to whom these private companies will be accountable; I'm surprised that he doesn't know. The contract would be with the police authority, whose responsibilities will pass in November to elected police and crime commissioners. Despite voting against commissioners, Prescott now aspires to be one of them. Private companies will not be able to arrest suspects, and they will not be solely responsible for investigating crimes. The public will always see police officers patrolling their neighbourhoods, responding to 999 calls and leading investigations. But the private sector can help to deliver behind-the-scenes services better and at lower cost. This frees up money for the frontline and enables us to make best use of policing's most valuable asset – the sworn officer. Under Blair, Labour understood the value of innovation in public services.

over privatisation may escalate over 12-month target after bank had advised government to float business at just 330p","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T09:20:54Z","body":"<p>Goldman Sachs has risked a further escalation of the Royal Mail privatisation row by putting a price target on the shares of 610p despite telling the government that the business should be floated at 330p last month.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman said the postal group's valuation should benefit from an increase in parcel deliveries, despite falling letter volumes.</p><p>The investment bank's 12-month price target of 610p represents an 85% premium on the flotation price, and gave further ammunition to those critics of the privatisation who argue the government sold off Royal Mail too cheaply.</p><p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"This raises yet more questions for ministers on their apparent failure to secure maximum value for the taxpayer in the Royal Mail fire sale.</p><p>\"While Vince Cable has dismissed concerns that taxpayers may have been short-changed by hundreds of millions of pounds as 'froth', analysts at the bank which advised the deal are predicting that it could rise still further.\"</p><p>If Goldman is correct the company's value would rise to just above £6bn in a year's time, compared with its flotation value of £3.3bn.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business, innovations and skills committee, said there were \"further questions that need to be asked\" following the publication of the Goldman note.</p><p>\"It confirms I think all the suspicions that between what the advisers were telling the government and what the advisers really felt was the potential of the company there was an enormous variation,\" Bailey told IB Times.</p><p>He added: \"You have to question why there is this analysis now and another analysis at a much lower price that they defended vigorously only just over a week ago. What's happened that's different and what information is different now than what they had before?\"</p><p>The analysts who produced the note are separate from the bankers who advised the government on the sale.</p><p>Goldman analysts, who gave Royal Mail a \"neutral\" rating, predicted a 7.7% rise in annual UK parcel revenues between 2013 and 2017, largely as a result of growth in online shopping. They predicted parcels will account for 57% of group revenues in 2017, up from 48% in 2013.</p><p>\"With further modest growth coming from EU parcels we expect group parcel growth to more than offset continued letter volume declines,\" analysts said in the note.</p><p>\"We forecast network modernisation (parcel automation and logistics optimisation) to drive productivity improvements and facilitate headcount reduction, delivering further margin improvement.\"</p><p>On the other hand, letter volumes are expected to decrease by 5.1% a year over the period.</p><p>Goldman said its analysis did not include the threat of future strike action by Royal Mail workers, considering the short-term risk of a strike as relatively low, although it acknowledged the potential for industrial action could be an ongoing investment risk. The threat of strike action has been cited by Cable as one of the reasons why the shares were sold at no higher than 330p.</p><p>Goldman added that other risks included a faster than expected decline in letter volumes, a delay in cost cutting, and proposed European Union data protection legislation, which could limit the ability of companies to engage in direct marketing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/27/royal-mail-profits-first-results-vince-cable\" title=\"\">Cable insisted on Wednesday that Royal Mail had not been sold too cheaply</a> when questioned by members of the BIS committee.</p><p>Cable and Michael Fallon, the business minister who handled the flotation, said they decided against increasing the sale price by 20p a share because the market was already jittery over a potential US debt default.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/20/royal-mail-privatisation-bankers-fees-select-committee\" title=\"\">Senior executives from Goldman were among those to be questioned last week by the same committee</a>, over their role in advising the government on the flotation.</p><p>Royal Mail shares surged by more than a third on the first day of trading and have risen further since then to more than 560p.</p>","headline":"Royal Mail shares: Goldman Sachs sets price target of

Why? Because of the lobbying power of big business","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T19:01:28Z","body":"<p>In other ages, states sought to seize as much power as they could. Today, the self-hating state renounces its powers. Governments anathematise governance. They declare their role redundant and illegitimate. They launch furious assaults on their own branches, seeking wherever possible to lop them off.</p><p>This self-mutilation is a response to the fact that power has shifted. States now operate at the behest of others. Deregulation, privatisation, the shrinking of the scope, scale and spending of the state: these are now seen as the only legitimate policies. The corporations and billionaires to whom governments defer will have it no other way.</p><p>Just as taxation tends to redistribute wealth, regulation tends to redistribute power. A democratic state controls and contains powerful interests on behalf of the powerless. This is why billionaires and corporations hate regulation, and – through their newspapers, thinktanks and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/dec/13/astroturf-libertarians-internet-democracy\" title=\"\">astroturf</a> campaigns – mobilise people against it. State power is tyranny, state power is freedom.</p><p>But the interchangeable middle managers who call themselves ministers cannot wholly dismiss the wishes of the electorate. They must show that they are doing something to protect what people value. They resolve the contradiction between the demands of the electorate and the demands of big business by shifting their responsibilities to something they call \"the market\". This term is often used as a euphemism for corporations and the very rich.</p><p>To justify the policy of marketisation, they invest the market with magical capabilities. It can reach the parts that the ordinary scope of government can't reach; it can achieve political miracles. I don't believe that market mechanisms are always wrong. I do believe that they fail to solve the problem of power. In fact they tend to compound it.</p><p>Last week the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/17/europe-climate-chief-vow-save-emissions-trading\" title=\"\">European emissions trading system</a> died. It was supposed to create a market for carbon, whose escalating price would force companies to abandon fossil fuels and replace them with less polluting alternatives. In principle it was as good a mechanism as any other. What it did not offer was a magical alternative to political intervention.</p><p>The scheme collapsed on Tuesday after the European parliament voted against an emergency withdrawal of some of the carbon permits whose over-supply had swamped the market. Why were too many permits issued? Because of the lobbying power of big business. Why did MEPs refuse to withdraw them? Because of the lobbying power of big business.</p><p>If a market is to serve a wider social goal than simply maximising corporate profits it must operate within a tight regulatory framework. Pricing mechanisms do not magic away the need for regulation – if anything, they enhance it. To make them work, politicians still have to confront and overcome powerful interests. They still need to govern and decide. Yet everywhere markets are invoked as an alternative to dirigiste and decisive government.</p><p>To make a significant impact, the price of carbon needs to be in the region of €30 or €40 per tonne. It needs to be incapable of falling far, and likely to rise. At the time of writing the price is <a href=\"http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/eu-emissions-trading-scheme-faces-existential-crisis/#.UXVc078rCIY\" title=\"\">€2.8 per tonne</a>, and it's going nowhere. The Economist reports that this puts European carbon permits \"below the level of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_debt\" title=\"\">junk bonds</a>\".</p><p>In an important respect the scheme has been worse than useless. New airports and roads and power stations have been justified with the claim they they will not raise emissions, as the greenhouse gases they produce will be absorbed by cuts made elsewhere. The one lasting impact of the European carbon market has been to rationalise polluting projects which might not otherwise have been built.</p><p>But even as this scheme collapses, governments are launching new ones, creating markets that are far less appropriate – even in theory – than the trade in carbon. Last month, the UK's <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a>, a body set up by the government but largely composed of company executives, . It invokes the magic of the markets to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of democratic governance.</p><p>Not everything it proposes is dangerous and wrong. Creating incentives to reforest the hills from which our rivers flow, or for farmers to use anaerobic digesters to process waste makes sense: as long as it redeploys rather than augments farm subsidies. But in other respects an attempt to reconcile the protection of the living planet with commerce simply turns the biosphere into another corporate asset.</p><p>For instance, the taskforce revives the&nbsp;old myth that nature is best served by harvesting timber. As long ago as 1995, <a href=\"http://www.britishwildlife.com/classic_articles/BW%206-137-147%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20in%20Britain.pdf\">a paper</a> by the biologists Clive Hambler and Martin Speight showed that of the woodland insect species listed as threatened in Britain, 65% are&nbsp;threatened by the removal of old and&nbsp;dead wood, while just 2% are threatened by a reduction in this management. But the taskforce maintains that bringing \"unmanaged woodlands into active, sustainable management for wood fuel … is a win-win for business and nature.\" Just as the myth was at last being laid to rest, it has been revived by the need to make nature and markets appear compatible.</p><p>This is an example of what&nbsp;happens in a market-based system: any clash between generating profit and protecting the natural world is resolved in favour of business, often&nbsp;with the help of junk science. Only&nbsp;those components of the ecosystem that can be commodified and sold are defended. Nature is worthy of protection when it is profitable to business. The moment it ceases to be so, it loses its social value and can be trashed. As prices fluctuate or crash, so&nbsp;do the fortunes of the ecosystems they are supposed to protect. As financial markets move in, with the help&nbsp;of the environmental bonds and securitisations the taskforce champions,&nbsp;the defence of nature becomes ever more volatile and uncertain. The living&nbsp;planet is reduced to a subsidiary&nbsp;of the human economy.</p><p>When governments pretend they no longer need to govern, when they pretend that a world regulated by bankers, corporations and the profit motive is a better world than one regulated by voters and their representatives, nothing is safe.

From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, 'Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody'.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\" title=\"\">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a> would recognise this moment. Now it is not the land his impostors are enclosing, but the rest of the natural world. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, nature is being valued and commodified so that it can be exchanged for cash.</p><p>The effort began in earnest under the last government. At a cost of £100,000, it commissioned a research company to produce a total annual price for England's ecosystems. After taking the money, the company reported – with a certain understatement – that this exercise was \"theoretically challenging to complete, and considered by some not to be a theoretically sound endeavour\". Some of the services provided by England's ecosystems, it pointed out, \"may in fact be infinite in value\".</p><p>This rare flash of common sense did nothing to discourage the current government from seeking first to put a price on nature, then to create a market in its disposal. The UK now has a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/\" title=\"\">natural capital committee</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a> and an inspiring new lexicon. We don't call it nature any more: now the proper term is \"natural capital\". Natural processes have become \"ecosystem services\", as they exist only to serve us. Hills, forests and river catchments are now \"green infrastructure\", while biodiversity and habitats are \"asset classes\" within an \"ecosystem market\". All of them will be assigned a price, all of them will become exchangeable.</p><p>The argument in favour of this approach is coherent and plausible. Business currently treats the natural world as if it is worth nothing. Pricing nature and incorporating that price into the cost of goods and services creates an economic incentive for its protection. It certainly appeals to both business and the self-hating state. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force speaks of \"substantial potential growth in nature-related markets – in the order of billions of pounds globally\".</p><p>Commodification, economic growth, financial abstractions, corporate power: aren't these the processes driving the world's environmental crisis? Now we are told that to save the biosphere we need more of them.</p><p>Payments for ecosystem services look to me like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since Rousseau's encloser first made an exclusive claim to the land. The government has already begun describing land owners as the \"providers\" of ecosystem services, as if they had created the rain and the hills and the rivers and the wildlife that inhabits them. They are to be paid for these services, either by the government or by \"users\". It sounds like the plan for the NHS.</p><p>Land ownership since the time of the first impostor has involved the gradual accumulation of exclusive rights, which were seized from commoners. Payments for ecosystem services extend this encroachment by appointing the landlord as the owner and instigator of the wildlife, the water flow, the carbon cycle, the natural processes that were previously deemed to belong to everyone and no one.</p><p>But it doesn't end there. Once a resource has been commodified, speculators and traders step in. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force now talks of \"harnessing City financial expertise to assess the ways that these blended revenue streams and securitisations enhance the ROI [return on investment] of an environmental bond\". This gives you an idea of how far this process has gone – and of the gobbledegook it has begun to generate.</p><p>Already the government is developing the market for trading wildlife, by experimenting with what it calls biodiversity offsets. If a quarry company wants to destroy a rare meadow, for example, it can buy absolution by paying someone to create another somewhere else. The government warns that these offsets should be used only to compensate for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" and \"must not become a licence to destroy\". But once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold? Nature, under this system, will become as fungible as everything else.</p><p>Like other aspects of neoliberalism, the commodification of nature forestalls democratic choice. No longer will we be able to argue that an ecosystem or a landscape should be protected because it affords us wonder and delight; we'll be told that its intrinsic value has already been calculated and, doubtless, that it  turns out to be worth less than the other uses to which the land could be put. The market has spoken: end of debate.</p><p></p><p>All those messy, subjective matters, the motivating forces of democracy, will be resolved in a column of figures. Governments won't need to regulate; the market will make the decisions that politicians have ducked. But trade is a fickle master, and unresponsive to anyone except those with the money. The costing and sale of nature represents another transfer of power to corporations and the very rich.</p><p>It diminishes us, it diminishes nature. By turning the natural world into a subsidiary of the corporate economy, it reasserts the biblical doctrine of dominion. It slices the biosphere into component commodities: already the government's task force is talking of \"unbundling\" ecosystem services, a term borrowed from previous privatisations. This might make financial sense; it makes no ecological sense. The more we learn about the natural world, the more we discover that its functions cannot be safely disaggregated.</p><p>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value – from love to greed – we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. Pull up the stakes, fill in the ditch, we're being conned again.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p>","headline":"Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all","trailText":"<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> Payments for 'ecosystem services' look like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since enclosure","newspaperPageNumber":"25","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344274678245/Gunnerside-village-Swaled-004.jpg","wordcount":"1018","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"394265264","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6511159","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Monbiot","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1784143","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-09T19:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/privatisation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/privatisation","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/ruralaffairs","webTitle":"Rural affairs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ruralaffairs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ruralaffairs","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"environment/rivers","webTitle":"Rivers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/rivers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/rivers","references":[]},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife","references":[]},{"id":"environment/land-rights","webTitle":"Land rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/land-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/land-rights","references":[]},{"id":"environment/water","webTitle":"Water","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/water","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot","rcsId":"GNL055772","r2ContributorId":"15660","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168161144/GeorgeMonbiot.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168160956/GeorgeMonbiot.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>George Monbiot is the author of the bestselling books The Age of Consent: A<br />Manifesto for a New World Order and Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain, as well as the investigative travel books Poisoned Arrows, Amazon Watershed and No Man's Land.

The idea is called biodiversity offsetting. It involves trading places: allowing people to destroy wildlife and habitats if, in return, they pay someone to create new habitats elsewhere. In April, the UK government <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/natural/biodiversity/uk/offsetting/pilots/\" title=\"\">launched six pilot projects</a> to test the idea, which would run for two years.</p><p></p><p>Four months ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">I wrote this</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/biodiversity/offsetting/documents/110714offsetting-guiding-principles.pdf\" title=\"\">government warns</a> that these offsets should be used only to compensate for 'genuinely unavoidable damage' and 'must not become a licence to destroy'; but once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold?\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The answer, it seems, is \"not very long\". A year and a half before the pilot projects have been completed, the new spirit of destruction is roaming the land. A place of outstanding wildlife value is now being considered for demolition, and biodiversity offsetting is being mooted as the means by which it can be justified. It's hard to believe that this scheme would still be receiving serious consideration if the mother of all excuses had not been proposed by the government.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/environmentandplanning/developmentplan/localdevelopmentframework/ldfevidencebase/lodgehill.aspx\" title=\"\">Lodge Hill, close to Gillingham in north Kent</a>, contains what could be the UK's highest concentration of nightingales. The species has suffered an astonishing decline in this country – over 90% in just 40 years – partly as a result of the destruction of its habitat. This site – of just 325 hectares – <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/Nightingale%20habitat%20compensation%20report%20FINAL%20_18%2010%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">contains roughly 1% of the remaining population</a>. It is one of the very few places where, on a summer's night, you can still hear the full nightingale orchestra, a sound that would once have been familiar to people across much of the country.</p><p></p><p>Medway council has proposed that the land at Lodge Hill be turned into a development of 5,000 houses. This, according to a <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/Nightingale%20habitat%20compensation%20report%20FINAL%20_18%2010%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the British Trust for Ornithology</a>, could destroy the area's entire population of nightingales. Even if some birds continue to use the adjoining woods, they are extremely vulnerable to cats, as they nest close to the ground. The pets arriving with the new homes are likely to snuff out what John Clare called \"<a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-nightingale-s-nest/\" title=\"\">the old woodland's legacy of song</a>.\"</p><p></p><p>So how do you justify the unjustifiable? You commission a consultancy (the Environment Bank) to investigate the potential for offsetting: in effect moving the habitat and its nightingales somewhere else. <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/EBL%20Lodge%20Hill%20report%20final%20draft%2013%20nov%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">It reported that</a>:</p><p></p><p>\"Offsetting could work in principle for nightingales in Kent – it is technically feasible but it is neither straightforward nor guaranteed\"</p><p></p><p>If a site of around 500 hectares were found and stocked with suitable habitat, a similar number of nightingales might establish itself there. But no one can be sure it will work. If it doesn't, by the time we find out it will be too late: the new habitat will take at least a decade to establish, while the existing habitat will be destroyed and the houses built in just two or three years. If the experiment fails it cannot be reversed.</p><p></p><p>The report suggests two principal means by which new nightingale habitat could be created in Kent. One is to coppice existing woodland: cutting the trees at ground level so that they resprout to create the shrubby growth that nightingales use. The other is to take an area of agricultural land and either plant it with scrub or allow scrub to regenerate naturally.</p><p></p><p>This invites two obvious responses. If woods are chosen, the offsetting process would not be creating wildlife habitat, but merely changing an existing habitat into something different. Coppicing favours some species at the expense of others, particularly those which require large trees, dead wood and an undisturbed understorey. What's good for nightingales may be bad for woodpeckers.</p><p></p><p>If 500 hectares of fields – a bigger site than Lodge Hill – can be taken out of agricultural use to compensate for the destruction of the nightingales' homes, why not spare Lodge Hill and build the houses in the fields?</p><p></p><p>The prospect of offsetting in this case looks to me like the \"licence to destroy\" that the government warned against. Rather than compensating for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" it looks as if it could be used to justify avoidable destruction: trashing a remarkable place for an unremarkable project which could be built elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>This case illustrates the danger inherent in the principle of offsetting. It makes nature as fungible as everything else. No place is valued as a place: it is broken down into a list of habitats and animals and plants, which could, in theory, be shifted somewhere else. It subjects our landscape and wildlife to the same process of commodification that has blighted everything else the corporate economy touches.</p><p></p><p>The notion of a \"like for like\" replacement is bogus. No two places are the same. No place that has been planned and measured and designed and planted as a wildlife habitat is the same as one that has arisen spontaneously, or that has always been there. Much of the delight of nature is that it is unscripted, spontaneous, unofficial, that it owes little or nothing to human design.</p><p></p><p>Accept the principle of biodiversity offsetting and you accept the idea that place means nothing. That nowhere is to be valued in its own right any more, that everything is exchangeable for everything else, and nothing can be allowed to stand in the way of the graders and degraders. That is not an idea I find easy to swallow.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">Monbiot.com</a></p>","headline":"Biodiversity offsetting will unleash a new spirit of destruction on the land","trailText":"<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> A place of outstanding wildlife value may be destroyed if in return someone is paid to create a habitat elsewhere","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/12/7/1354885628454/Monbiot-blog--Common-Nigh-003.jpg","wordcount":"907","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"400689370","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6996832","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Monbiot","internalPageCode":"1839473","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-14T13:25:10Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/dec/07/biodiversity-offsetting-unleash-wildlife-destruction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/dec/07/biodiversity-offsetting-unleash-wildlife-destruction","tags":[{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot's blog","description":"The Guardian's George Monbiot blogs on the environment, social justice, and other things that make him angry","type":"blog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot","references":[]},{"id":"environment/biodiversity","webTitle":"Biodiversity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biodiversity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/biodiversity","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife","references":[]},{"id":"environment/conservation","webTitle":"Conservation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/conservation","references":[]},{"id":"politics/planning","webTitle":"Planning policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/planning","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/planning","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot","rcsId":"GNL055772","r2ContributorId":"15660","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168161144/GeorgeMonbiot.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/22/1398168160956/GeorgeMonbiot.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>George Monbiot is the author of the bestselling books The Age of Consent: A<br />Manifesto for a New World Order and Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain, as well as the investigative travel books Poisoned Arrows, Amazon Watershed and No Man's Land.
