We will cover the interviews and reactions in a new live blog we're launching momentarily.</p> <p><strong>&bull; The Syria debate underwent a sudden shift today, from the question of US strikes to potential new diplomatic headway in the form of Assad cutting some kind of deal that could diminish his chemical weapons arsenal. </strong></p> <p><strong>&bull; Russia called on Syria to turn control of its chemical weapons arsenal over to international authorities as prelude to the arsenal's destruction. The Syrian foreign minister immediately \"welcomed\" the demand.</strong> The swerve in Russian rhetoric was variously depicted as a \"stalling tactic\" to put off US military strikes and as a sign of potential new diplomatic progress.</p> <p><strong>&bull; The sudden shift in the Syria debate originated with apparently offhand remarks by US secretary of state John Kerry Monday morning.</strong> In a London news conference, Kerry said Assad could avoid strikes by surrendering control of \"every single bit\" of his arsenal to the international community by the end of the week. Soon afterward the state department walked back the statement, said Kerry was making a \"hypothetical\" \"rhetorical argument.\"</p> <p><strong>&bull; And yet top US officials, including deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken, state department spokeswoman Marie Harf and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton appeared to take the proposal seriously.</strong> The White House said it would take a \"hard look\" at the proposal. All of the above stipulated that they did not expect much and that the push toward US strikes continues apace.</p> <p><strong>&bull; At least 49 people have died from violence in Syria on Monday, including 25 in Damascus and environs,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=734641856562953&amp;l=ef4e5ac1f1\">according to</a> the Local Coordination Committees activist group.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T22:50:31.956+01:00\">at 10.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-522e3a57e4b0b4804819a481\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T22:15:03.554+01:00\">10.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov his comments about Syria averting a U.S. military strike by turning over its chemical weapons within a week were rhetorical and <strong>not meant to be a proposal</strong>, a senior U.S. Official said on Monday, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kerry also voiced \"serious skepticism\" when Lavrov offered to explore the idea, saying that the United States would take a look at any serious proposal, but this could not be a reason to slow the White House's efforts to secure congressional authorization to use force against Syria, the official told reporters traveling back from London with Kerry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-522e32d0e4b0716040115e8d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T21:42:57.029+01:00\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This blog has featured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">firsthand</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">interviews</a> with opposition fighters who are not happy about the idea of US strikes inside Syria because the <strong>fighters assume the real targets are them, not Assad</strong>.

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Missiles are poor law enforcers. They rarely kill the right people. They cause vast destruction, wrecking the lives of civilians and increasing their dependency on their oppressors. Missile attacks are mere displays of power, usually as a spectacular alternative to a ground assault. Their military ineffectiveness makes them susceptible to mission creep.</p> <p>Already Obama has shifted from threatening a \"surgical punitive strike\" to a massively destructive one, intended to aid the insurgency and thus assist in regime change. This happens to be against international law. More to the point, such missile attacks did not \"work\" in Serbia, Iraq or Afghanistan.

The committee inserted language making it \"the policy of the United States to change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria.\"</p> <p><strong>&bull; That seemed to go beyond the \"limited\" strikes proposed by the president.</strong> But Senator John McCain, the author of the amendment, claimed the White House backed the added language.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Syrian state media denied a Reuters report that former defense minister Ali Habib,</strong> an Alawite who has been personally close to Assad, has defected. Reuters stood by its report.</p> <p><strong>&bull; President Obama called for international support for military action in Syria at a news conference in Stockholm. </strong>He was en route to the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, which runs Thursday-Friday.</p> <p>&bull; <strong>Russian president Vladimir Putin said strikes on Syria would amount to \"aggression\" if not backed by a UN resolution.</strong> Putin claimed he might back such a resolution if conclusive evidence emerged of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the regime.</p> <p><strong>&bull; President Obama said</strong> <strong>\"We've hit a wall in progress on the Russian relationship\"</strong> but said he was \"always hopeful\" Putin would change his mind.</p> <p>&bull;<strong> The French parliament debated a use of force in Syria, although no vote on a war resolution was scheduled and President Hollande does not need parliament to act.</strong></p> <p>And from the House hearing on the administration's Syria policy:</p> <p>&bull; <strong>Kerry gave an estimate of the extremist element among the opposition that seemed larger than previous estimates. \"Bad guys\" make up 15-25% of the opposition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2013/sep/04/syria-crisis-putin-warns-west-live#block-52277ad0e4b03491b6ac865e\">he said</a>, out of 70,000-100,000 total.</strong> On Tuesday Kerry said the opposition is growing more moderate.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Kerry said the US was not acting as the world's policeman</strong> but it does have great power and as a consequence extra responsibility.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Hagel emphasized the complexity of the situation: \"This is an imperfect situation,\" he said.</strong> \"There are no good options here... \"This is unpredictable, it's complicated, it's dangerous.\"</p> <p><strong>&bull; Kerry said it's \"100%\" likely Assad will use chemical weapons routinely unless Congress endorses a strike on Syria.</strong></p> <p>&bull; <strong>Kerry said America's security has been directly threatened:</strong> \"Our security interests are directly involved in what is happening in the Middle East.

Discussing Syria pledge to sign up to the chemical weapons convention, Assad said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It does not mean that Syria will sign the documents, fulfil the obligations and that&rsquo;s it. It is a bilateral process aimed principally at making the US cease pursuing its policy of aggression against Syria and proceed in compliance with the Russian initiative. When we see the US genuinely working towards stability in the region and stop threatening, striving to attack, and delivering arms to terrorists then we will believe that the necessary processes can be finalised. From a Syrian perspective, we perceive that this is achievable and can be implemented; however this is not a single-track process.</p> </blockquote> <p>The transcript also confirms Assad's view that Syria would only be obliged to abide by the terms of treaty a month after signing up. \"I believe the agreement will come into effect a month after signing it and Syria will start submitting data regarding its chemical weapons stockpile to international organisations,\" it quotes Assad saying.</p> <p>US Secretary of State <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/john-kerry-syria-chemical-weapons-surrender\">John Kerry said the standard terms of the treaty do not apply in this case</a>.</p> <p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said. \"And the words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\"</p> <p>In his interview Assad also appeared to accuse Turkey or Saudi Arabia of supplying Syrian rebels with chemical weapons. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is that the West and particular countries in the region, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, maintain direct contact with the terrorists and supply them with all measure of arms. We believe that one of these countries has supplied the terrorists with chemical weapons. One would assume that these states can cease supplying the terrorists with such weapons; nevertheless there are terrorists who would never comply. When they have arms and the opportunity to inflict havoc, they would never submit, even to those who provided them with weapons and money.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cb40d3a3-4968-48cf-b2fb-42cd59efb9d2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/13/1379068876454/3a24314e-0165-4722-b9d4-6324a72846e3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"President Bashar al-Assad attending an interview with Russian television Rossiya 24 in Damascus.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>President Bashar al-Assad attending an interview with Russian television Rossiya 24 in Damascus.

Considering the regime's actions, this is not something the Syrian people can afford to grant the regime. It is vital the threat of force stays on the table. For a UNSC resolution to be anything other than a get-out-of-jail free card for the regime it must be enforceable under Chapter 7. <br />The regime cannot be allowed to use diplomatic activity to indefinitely stall international action while it continues its policy of widespread violence against civilians. This can only be accomplished by making it clear to the regime it must fulfil obligations within a set time period, and that international military action will be the consequence of non-compliance.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Coalition is also clear that in the unlikely event the regime does turn its weapons of mass destruction over to the international community to be destroyed, the Syrian people will not consider the regime absolved of its guilt.<br />&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5232c37fe4b0c9a06407dc3a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-13T09:57:49.626+01:00\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It wouldn't have happened in Sir Humphrey's day ...</p> <p>Whitehall's top civil servant on Syria has turned to social media to take a Hollywood star to task for criticising the west's approach to the crisis.</p> <p>Actor John Cusack used his Twitter account to question what he sees as a rush to war over Syria. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johncusack/statuses/377660667756834816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>frankly whether  serin gas or laser guided missile its a nuance that&#39;s lost on me.&#10; more war more murder more hate spreading through  world</p>&mdash; John Cusack (@johncusack) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncusack/statuses/377660667756834816\">September 11, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johncusack/statuses/377915020795183104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>He needs to show how tough he is -- world is well aware that America knows how to bomb people mr president  <a href=\"http://t.co/CaWTQhgB03\">http://t.co/CaWTQhgB03</a></p>&mdash; John Cusack (@johncusack) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncusack/statuses/377915020795183104\">September 11, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Comments like this appear to have provoked Reza Afshar, head of the Syria team at the foreign office, to respond. \"But nobody was talking about war,\" he tweeted Cusack, adding: \"In fact it was explicitly ruled out.

Here's an excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The international consensus that the regime was responsible [for the chemical attack] is growing. During the G20 eleven nations including the UK signed a statement condemning the regime&rsquo;s use of chemical weapons and supporting efforts by the US and other countries to reinforce the prohibition against chemical weapons use. A week later that statement has now been signed by 25 countries.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Saturday I attended the EU Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Vilnius, which unanimously agreed that there was strong evidence of regime culpability, and that &lsquo;in the face of this cynical use of chemical weapons, the international community cannot remain idle.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />This growing international pressure, including the threat of military action by the US, has had an impact.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Monday I hosted Secretary Kerry for detailed discussions on the way forward. On the same day the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov announced that Russia would urge the Syrian regime to sign up to a proposal which would place their chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction. In response, the regime announced that it supported the initiative and was ready to cooperate; and that it intended to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, open up its sites and give up its chemical weapons.<br />&nbsp;<br />Given their track record, any commitment made by the Syrian regime must be treated with great caution. This is a regime that has lied for years about possessing chemical weapons, that still denies it has used them, and that refused for four months to allow UN inspectors into Syria.<br />&nbsp;<br />Nevertheless, as the Prime Minister has said, we have to take this proposal seriously and test its sincerity. If the Syrian regime verifiably gave up its chemical weapons stockpiles this would obviously be a major step forward. We agree with President Obama that this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.</p> <p>Intensive discussions are now taking place about how to achieve this, and Secretary Kerry is meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss the proposal.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft Security Council resolution, and the five permanent members of the Security Council met for consultations last night. A resolution must establish a binding commitment for the Syrian regime to give up its chemical weapons within a specific timeframe. We will hold further discussions in the Security Council once the UN inspectors have reported.<br />&nbsp;<br />The United Kingdom will make every effort to negotiate an enforceable agreement that credibly, reliably, and promptly places the regime&rsquo;s chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction.<br />&nbsp;<br />The House should be in no doubt of the scale of the challenge and the immense practical difficulties that would need to be overcome.<br />&nbsp;<br />It would require the genuine cooperation of a regime that denied until recently that it possessed these weapons and has used them ruthlessly against its own people on at least 14 occasions, killing many hundreds of people including women and children. The regime has a large number of sites &ndash; possibly the largest stock of chemical weapons possessed by any nation in the world &ndash; in numerous different locations in a country that is a contested battlefield. We would need to have confidence that all chemical weapons had been identified and secured and that they could not fall into the wrong hands.<br />&nbsp;<br />These issues can all be overcome with sufficient international unity and goodwill, and provided there is a complete change of approach by the Assad regime to all of its past practices and deceptions.<br />&nbsp;<br />So we will approach these negotiations with determination and resolve, knowing that if successful it would be an important breakthrough, but that overcoming all these issues will not be easy and that in the meantime thousands of Syrians are dying every month from conventional weapons in this worsening conflict.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is abundantly clear that this diplomatic opening would not have come about had the international community shown complacency or disregard for the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and that pressure on the regime must be maintained.<br />&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52319602e4b0a811a627c8eb\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:44:23.470+01:00\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hague calls for binding UN resolution</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for a tough UN resolution to hold Syria to its commitment to hand over its chemical weapons.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons, Hague said he was wary of Syria's promises and that dealing with the Assad's regime's chemical stockpiles posed \"immense practical difficulties\". He said: \"We will need to have confidence that all chemical weapons have been identified and secured and that they would not fall into the wrong hands.\"</p> <p>But the foreign secretary said the initiative presented a \"diplomatic opening\" that would not have come about without international pressure to hold the Syrian government to account for last month's chemical weapons attack.</p> <p>Hague said: \"Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft security council resolution ...

US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for talks in Geneva on a plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control.</p> <p>Here's a round up of the latest developments:</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/us-syria-russian-chemical-weapons-handover\"><strong>The US has welcomed what it called \"very specific\" Russian proposals to secure the handover of Syria's chemical weapons before key talks in Geneva on Thursday.</strong></a> The White House urged patience and said it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by \"putting their prestige on the line\". \"We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,\" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/russia-offers-four-step-plan-for-syria-arms-handover-report.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=54312&amp;NewsCatID=359\"><strong>Russia has proposed a four-stage plan for Syria to hand over its weapons, according to AFP citing the Russian daily Kommersant. </strong></a>Under the plan Syria would:</p> <ol> <li>Join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] the body that upholds the international ban</li> <li>Disclose the location of chemical stockpiles</li> <li>Allow OPCW inspectors access to the sites</li> <li>Destroy the stockpile of weapons</li> </ol> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24058006\">The five permanent UN security council members have met in New York to discuss the Russian plan, the BBC reports.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US, UK and French diplomats held separate talks before the meeting of the so-called P5 envoys. The meeting lasted less than an hour and envoys declined to comment as they left.</p> <p>The French have already been working on a draft resolution that would be enforced by Chapter VII of the UN charter, which would in effect sanction the use of force if Syria failed in its obligations.</p> <p>However, Russia has already indicated that this would be unacceptable, as would any resolution blaming the Syrian government for chemical attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has drawn a contrast between what he portrayed as Russia's diplomatic approach to Syria and the Obama administration's talk of military intervention.</a>&nbsp;</strong>He also claimed Barack Obama's talk of US exceptionalism was \"dangerous\".&nbsp;Writing in the New York Times he warned:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it ...</p> <p>From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today&rsquo;s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos.</p> <p>We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/11/un_report_will_finger_assad_for_massive_chemical_attack\"><strong>UN inspectors investigating last month's chemical attack east of Damascus have compiled enough circumstantial evidence to suggest the Assad regime was responsible, diplomats have told Foreign Policy's The Cable blog.</strong></a> \"You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author,\" one said.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/aleppo-rebels-angry-diplomacy-assad\"><strong>The US shift from planning an attack on the Assad regime to diplomacy has prompted despair and anger among rebels in Aleppo, Martin Chulov reports from the city.&nbsp;</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebels of the north held out hope that real help would arrive some time. \"We were depending on this,\" said Sheikh Omar Otthman, a leader of the Liwa al-Tawheed brigade, the main opposition militia in Aleppo, of the now uncertain international intervention. \"The suffering of the people of Ghouta could have created an opportunity for all our suffering to be lifted\" ...</p> <p>\"They've spent the past two weeks saying Bashar is a liar and must be punished and that he needs to know that he can't get away with what he does,\" said Abu Hamza, a former colonel in the Syrian military who became a central figure in the war for the north soon after it began.</p> <p>\"And then they give him a chance to do more of what he has always done, get away with murder. He will stall them, trick them and wear them down. And they will send the ships home. And we'll be left alone.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:25:06.332+01:00\">at 11.25am BST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Syria claims 'full membership' in global chemical weapons ban – as it happened","trailText":"Follow live updates as the US and Russia discuss plans place Syria's chemical weapons under international control","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378989185127/afb98a6f-8c4f-4f90-b9fc-c736d2eff43c-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"7933","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417092960","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52316c81e4b0c9a06407dbd1","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Matthew Weaver and Tom McCarthy","displayRelativeTimes":"true","internalPageCode":"1964180","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-13T10:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-crisis-russia-us-talks-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-crisis-russia-us-talks-live","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

The author of the piece, Elizabeth O'Bagy (whose name Kerry misspelled) of the hawkish Institute for the Study of War, later came under fire for not disclosing in the article (or the newspaper) her links to a pro-opposition lobbyist group, the Syrian Emergency Task Force. O'Bagy has since released a <a href=\"http://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/elizabeth-obagy\">statement</a> saying that she does not participate in the group's political advocacy work. (h/t: @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/376008779835260928\">lrozen</a>)</p> <p>What other information is Kerry going on? He seemed to be working from a different briefing book than the Republican congressman who questioned him about the opposition, <strong>Raya writes:</strong></p> <p>Mike McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security committee, asked Kerry to address claims that the \"majority of rebel forces are &hellip; radical Islamists pouring in from all over the world.\"</p> <p>Kerry&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2013/sep/04/syria-crisis-putin-warns-west-live#block-52277ad0e4b03491b6ac865e\">replied</a>,&nbsp;\"I just don&rsquo;t agree that the majority are the bad guys and al-Qaida.

About, somewhere maybe, 15-25% might be one group or another of what we would deem to be bad guys. There are many different groups ...The general belief is that there is a real, moderate opposition that exists &hellip;</p> </blockquote> <p>McCaul responded&nbsp;that in the briefings that he&rsquo;s attended, the figure was closer to &ldquo;50% &ndash;&nbsp;and rising.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;As <a href=\"http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/06/making_sense_of_the_syrian_rebels_order_of_battle\">Foreign Policy put it </a>this morning, &ldquo;Who the Syrian rebels are depends on whom you ask.&rdquo;</p> <p>Charles Lister, a terrorism and insurgency analyst based in London, went on a widely shared Twitter-spree Thursday to make the point that there is no such thing as a monolithic opposition with a certain percentage makeup of \"extremists\" or \"moderates.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>The key takeaway from Lister: &ldquo;one simply CANNOT view the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&amp;src=hash\">#</a>Syria conflict as 1 single conflict&hellip; In the end, no single portion of the opposition is dominant on a nationwide basis.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&amp;src=hash\">#</a>Syria consists of countless theaters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/statuses/375687640495828992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Here follows some of my initial thoughts: Fundamentally, it is far too simplistic in its categorisation of the conflict&#39;s dynamics.</p>&mdash; Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/statuses/375687640495828992\">September 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In a recently published report, &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus128WhiteTablerZelin.pdf\">Syria&rsquo;s military opposition: How effective, united or extremist?</a>&rdquo; the Washington Institute for Near East Policy paints, in broad terms, a vague picture of the &ldquo;nature of rebel forces&rdquo;:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The kaleidoscopic nature of the rebel forces makes generalizing about their quality and capabilities very difficult and puts a premium on detailed information about specific units ... Some appear disciplined, well-armed, responsive to their commanders, and tactically competent. Others appear much less so, especially in terms of armament and tactical skill. The rebels come from all strata of Syrian society: wealthy and poor, urban and rural, secular and religious, tribal and urbanized, educated and uneducated, former military and civilian. Many units are local in origin, raised by local people for the defense of a town or village. Some are centered on defectors. Many are religious, though not necessarily radically religious, in orientation. While some Kurdish elements fight alongside them in Aleppo and some Kurds and, perhaps Christians, are in rebel formations, the rebels are overwhelmingly a Sunni Arab army. Rebel units are distributed across a broad ideological spectrum, with secular units at one pole and Salafi jihadists at the other, and most falling between the two. Over time the units have tended to become more Islamic, certainly in religious language, visual symbols, prayer, and general orientation. A major differentiation among Islamic units is between those that are Islamic with a national or Syrian agenda and those with a global jihadist mission.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a closer look at the composition of Syria&rsquo;s opposition fighters, the UK&rsquo;s Independent has also recently published:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/freedom-fighters-cannibals-the-truth-about-syrias-rebels-8662618.html\">Freedom fighters?

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>&bull; <strong>President Obama was faced with a major new complication to any military action in Syria when Britain appeared to drop out of a prospective coalition.</strong> Prime minister David Cameron lost a narrow parliamentary vote to endorse the use of force in Syria. \"It is clear to me that the British parliament, reflecting the will of the British people, does not want to see military action,\" Cameron said. \"I get that and the government will act accordingly.\"</p> <p>&bull; <strong>The White House projected resolve in the face of the British vote.</strong> \"President Obama&rsquo;s decision-making will be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States,\" a security adviser said in a statement.</p> <p>&bull; <strong>Senior intelligence officials held a conference call briefing for members of Congress on possible military strikes on Syria.</strong> The call began at 6pm ET, directly after the failed British resolution. Signs of congressional restiveness over the apparent White House intention of conducting its Syria plan without a legislature vote were <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/syria-congress-obama-96053.html\">reportedly</a> growing. </p> <p><strong>&bull; US officials speaking on condition of anonymity said there were noticeable holes in US intelligence assessments linking Bashar Assad to the use of chemical weapons on 21 August.</strong> A classified assessment by the director of national intelligence said agents could not continuously pinpoint Assad's chemical weapons supplies, according to an AP report. The White House said it would publish an unclassified version of its intelligence assessments.</p> <p><strong>&bull; The Obama administration said any attack on Syria would be \"discrete and limited.\"</strong> State department and White House spokespeople rejected comparisons between the faulty WMD intelligence that the US into the Iraq war and the intelligence on Assad's weapons.</p> <p><strong>&bull; A meeting called by Russia of the five permanent members of the UN security council adjourned without publicly reported result.</strong> Secretary general Ban Ki-moon said UN chemical weapons inspectors, who carried out a third day of investigations Thursday, would leave the country on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>&bull; France appeared to be making preparations to join a military effort on Syria.</strong> Turkey has pledged strong support. Denmark vowed political support although it said it had not been asked for military involvement. A German poll showed deep opposition to the effort. Italy has said it would support military action against Assad.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Tomorrow we can expect a lot of US congressman to air their views on a potential Syria intervention</strong>. The question: will they decide they want to break their vacations and return to Washington for a war resolution vote? Or will they be content to air their opinions, and return to Capitol Hill on 9 September as planned?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521fd2b1e4b0b76ce52c7807\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-30T00:01:05.404+01:00\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>President Obama will continue to consult with British leaders but will ultimately <strong>\"be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States,\" </strong>White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement reacting to the British parliamentary vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have seen the result of the Parliament vote in the UK tonight.

We are absolutely confident that victory is by God, not by US. The US administration has been protecting the regime all the time and won't stop supporting it. This regime has protected Israel's borders over 40 years. The US won't topple this regime at all.

They can be delivered in missiles, bombs, rockets, artillery shells and other large munitions.<br /> The Syrian regime is believed to possess tabun, sarin and VX. Absorbed through the skin or inhaled, these agents can within seconds or minutes depending on the dose cause extreme runny nose and salivation, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and convulsions. [...]<br /> Germany developed the first nerve agents before and during World War II, although the Nazis did not use them during the war. The only time nerve agents are believed to have been used on the battlefield was in the 1980s Iraq-Iran war.</p> <p>MUSTARD GAS</p> <p>One of the best-known chemical weapons, mustard gas is a blister agent that attacks the eyes and skin, causing severe blisters. If inhaled, it can also damage the lungs and other organs. The gas does not cause immediate symptoms, which means those exposed to it can unknowingly take high dosages. While not usually lethal, exposure to mustard gas is generally debilitating.<br /> Mustard gas was first used by the German army in World War I against British forces. Saddam Hussein was accused of using the gas in Iraq's war with Iran, as well as in his 1987-1988 crackdown on the country's Kurdish minority. The most notorious case was on the village of Halabja, which killed some 5,000 people in the deadliest chemical weapons attack ever against civilians.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T16:52:00.088+01:00\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-521f67b2e4b088aaf5f49c79\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T16:24:34.346+01:00\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Obama administration has <strong>dispatched the secretaries of state and defense to hold conference calls with legislators <del>to Capitol Hill</del></strong> on Syria, presumably to build support for potential military strikes, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel are among senior U.S. officials who will brief members of Congress on Thursday about the situation in Syria, a congressional aide told Reuters.</p> <p>President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper will also participate in the briefing to be held in conference call at 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT), according to the aide, who had been informed of the briefing lineup by the White House.</p> </blockquote> <p>The White House has made no move to hold a congressional vote on military action in Syria.

He said:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We as Syrian nationals have great confidence in our government and our army. The US has been threatening Syria for ages but it could not do anything. The US administration has to know that the moment it strikes Syria, the Syrian army and the resistance will erase Israel off the ground. So, if US is no more in need of Israel, it can attack Syria.</p> <p>The situation in Damascus is normal. We can see people in the streets carefree of all the threats. To the contrary, they look as if they are celebrating and the traffic is so busy.</p> <p>I and my family have not taken any preparations for the war. We do our daily shopping as usual. It is true that before we could do shopping for a week as the Syrian Lire was at a good value but now, we, and a lot of Syrian families, do daily shopping. Though some of the businessmen try to play with the value of the Syrian Lire in the market, still you can have two kilos of bread for 15 Syrian Lire which is very cheap.</p> <p>I would be a liar if I say everything is okay all over Damascus. Violent districts lack lots of things but districts under the government's control have everything. If you go to Damascus countryside, you can find all sort of vegetables and beef but they cant get them down to the city because of the gangsters who do not allow the farmers to do so.&nbsp;</p> <p>Revolution should provide you with security, but look at the so-called rebels, they attack schools and take children by force out of them.They are terrifying innocent people.</p> <p>These people who claim that they are launching a revolution, most of them are uneducated and do not understand the meaning of freedom and democracy. Sometimes, I try to speak to them via Facebook, immediately they start to abuse me verbally when they recognise that I'm with president Bashar and the Syrian army. They are fighting for freedom but they do not give me the freedom to express my opinion.&nbsp;</p> <p>We have seen enough of the democracy brought to Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. It is an imported democracy that we do not need at all and does not work in our Arab community.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the UN inspection team, he said:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Could they tell me why the chemical attack did not reach us though we live in Damascus? Can you believe that the Syrian army would use chemical weapons without thinking of other districts in the capital.? All these attacks are fabricated by these gangsters who want to bring the Americans to Syria.</p> <p>Why does no one talk about the massacres conducted in Lattakia countryside lately when more than 450 people killed. These monsters tied a pregnant woman from the&nbsp;Latikia countryside to a tree and cut her belly and killed her brutally with her baby. Why western media do not write about these massacres?&nbsp;</p> <p>All that they care about now is the chemical attack. Do you believe it that the government would attack Damascus with chemical weapons? How can we be still alive? It is absolutely untrue that the government would do so.&nbsp;</p> <p>All this fuss against Syria is a conspiracy, an international conspiracy. They want to destroy Syria within three months but the steadfastness of the Syrian people will shock them.&nbsp;</p> <p>They want the government and the opposition to be equal but how can they do that when al-QaIda is fighting with the opposition?&nbsp;</p> <p>If the US decide to come down, I will defend Syria with the last drop of my blood. I and my sons won't allow any foreign boot to step on Syria holy soil. I myself will fight to the end.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just go now to the army recruitment centres in Damascus, you will find thousands of young Syrian men who volunteered to join the army to defend Syria as soon as they heard of the US threats.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521f23b6e4b06e09d5c5806b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T11:34:30.541+01:00\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Syria's neighbours are preparing for conflict.&nbsp;</p> <p>Turkey is on alert against possible chemical attacks from Syria and has stocked food and gas masks along their shared border, officials say.</p> <p>The Turkish government's crisis management centre said on Twitter on Thursday that officials had designated bunkers at seven areas along the border to protect the people in the area from harm.</p> <p>It also said a team of 100 chemical weapons experts were sent to the border area which was being screened for any signs of chemical attacks.<br />Turkey has backed Syria's opposition and rebels and said it would take part in any international coalition that would move against the Syrian government.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/29/thousands_of_israelis_jostle_for_gas_masks/\">Israeli police say thousands of Israelis are crowding gas-mask distribution facilities</a>.</p> <p>Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said officers were deployed to&nbsp;maintain order in the northern city of Haifa, where more than 5,000 people jostled in line as they waited for their protective kits today.</p> <p>Israel has called up reservists and deployed missile defense batteries in preparation for a possible Syrian response to an American attack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-827f32b9-04eb-4b0f-ad83-a7de2fb9225e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/29/1377772335624/fa35ca64-5043-432c-b339-7d681164cac3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Israelis wait in line to pick up and change gas masks at the central post office in Tel Aviv, Israel, 29 August 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Israelis wait in line to pick up and change gas masks at the central post office in Tel Aviv, Israel, 29 August 2013.

President Francois Hollande had told ambassadors on Tuesday that France would make its decision in &ldquo;the coming days&rdquo; leaving room for manoeuvre. However, this morning a French naval frigate left the southern French port of Toulon reportedly headed for waters off Syria to join US craft already there, its anti-aircraft capacity key in potentially protecting against any Syrian counter air-strikes. Although officially there was no confirmation of the frigate's destination, its move was seen by French media as a sign that Paris was stepping up its preparations for any action.</p> <p>After a leading a defence council meeting yesterday, Hollande will see Ahmad Jarba today.&nbsp;Under France's presidential system, Hollande does not need a parliament vote before taking action. But he is still dependent on acting with a coalition of international allies and sensitive to divisions in his own political class. Hollande has the backing of his Socialist party and the Greens. The main opposition party, the right-wing UMP, is divided, with some MPs pro-intervention, others cautious. The hard-left Jean-Luc Melenchon has warned against intervention, the far-right Marine Le Pen said intervention would mean Hollande was &ldquo;choosing the islamists&rdquo;. The French parliament will debate the issue next Thursday but without a vote, and the decision-making power rests firmly with the Elys&eacute;e.</p> <p>Opinion polls in France have often shown the country divided and hesitant on military intervention, namely over Afghanistan, although France's recent and sudden intervention in Mali gained support in the polls. <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/08/28/01003-20130828ARTFIG00491-les-francais-sont-mitiges-vis-a-vis-d-une-intervention-militaire.php\">An Ifop poll today for Le Figaro found that 55% of French people would support a UN intervention in Syria, but only 41% would support French military engagement</a>. Left-wing sympathisers were more in favour of both types of intervention than right-wing sympathisers. However, French public opinion could evolve. An Ifop poll in July found 60% of French people were against any intervention in Syria.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-521f0b98e4b0689d498de3c9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T09:51:36.556+01:00\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian navy has denied that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f058be4b06e09d5c58057\">the deployment of war ships in the eastern Mediterranean</a>&nbsp;is linked to events in Syria and said it is part of a long-planned rotation of its ships in the area.

Here's Angelique:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under the French constitution, the president, \"who is also head of the army,&ldquo; holds all powers to order forces to intervene abroad and is simply obliged to inform the parliament up to three days after launching an operation. MPs are only required to vote when action needs to be prolonged beyond four months. The French parliament debate on Syria called for Wednesday is currently not scheduled to include a vote and is more of a courtesy gesture.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Obama's decision to call on Congress has left Hollande in an increasingly awkward position politically at home, where opponents are already questioning France's role as the US's main ally in Syria&nbsp;after Britain ruled out involvement in military action.&nbsp;</p> <p>Francois Fillon, the former prime minister and member of the right-wing UMP opposition, said on Sunday \"I think that in certain circumstances France can't go to war without the clear support of parliament.\" He had earlier warned that France should not act \"lightly\" or passively \"tag along\" behind the Americans but consider the \"dangers\" of military action in a \"volatile\" region. The UMP leader Jean-Francois&nbsp;Cop&eacute;&nbsp;said France must keep \"its total freedom of initiative\" in relation to the Americans and wait for the UN inspectors' conclusions on chemical weapons use. \"The Iraq syndrome is present in everyone's minds,\" he added.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the centre, Jean-Louis Borloo and Francois Bayrou also called for a parliament vote, as did the hard-left Front de Gauche. The Socialist parliamentary majority and their government partners, the Greens, are behind Hollande.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52235d78e4b03491b6ac84b6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-01T16:30:00.960+01:00\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ILNA report quoting former Iranian president Rafsanjani as blaming the Syrian government for a chemical attack on the people, which report we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/syria-crisis-reaction-obama-decision-military-action#block-52235170e4b074ec2339218a\">featured on this blog earlier</a>, <strong>has been changed.

Now it has time to hide all the &ldquo;materials and chemical agents&rdquo; somewhere or even &ldquo;share them out among its militia&rdquo;. If Obama has decided on a strike, the US must hit Assad soon, and hard enough &ldquo;so that both Assad and Iran know the pain of crossing that red line&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52232f6de4b0c622abecf450\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-01T13:13:33.355+01:00\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's <strong>Glenn Greenwald</strong> writes that if Congress goes against the president on Syria, he may well just ignore it.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What makes the celebratory reaction to yesterday's announcement particularly odd is that the Congressional vote which Obama said he would seek appears, in his mind, to have no binding force at all.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Israel is calm and self-assured. Israeli citizens know very well that we are prepared for any possible scenario. Israeli citizens must also know that our enemies have very good reasons not to test our strength &ndash; they know why.</p> </blockquote> <p>But some politicians and commentators expressed dismay or even outrage, concluding that the US could not be trusted in future to defend red lines in relation the Iranian nuclear programme. Minister Avi Wortzman said:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The American hesitance, and the rest of the world's hypocrisy confirms the concern that when it comes to maintaining its security, Israel should not trust others and their promises, but must be prepared to protect its own security interests.</p> </blockquote> <p>Writing on his Facebook page before Obama's statement, economics and trade minister Naftali Bennett said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The international stuttering and hesitancy on Syria just proves once more that Israel cannot count on anyone but itself. From Munich 1938 to Damascus 2013 nothing has changed. This is the lesson we ought to learn from the events in Syria.</p> </blockquote> <p>For military analyst Alex Fishman, writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the lesson was similar:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we find ourselves in a crisis with Iran, no one in the world is going to be prepared to move a single plane on our behalf. At best, we&rsquo;ll receive verbal support.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4424649,00.html\">Ron Ben-Yishai, the paper's veteran war correspondent, said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>President Obama blinked, and this is bad. It is bad for the US' interests, it's bad for its allies' interests and it sends an encouraging message to cruel, unrestrained regimes that possess or don't possess weapons of mass destruction. The American president's decision to turn to the two houses of Congress and seek their approval to deal the Assad regime a punishing and deterring blow does not necessarily block such a blow, but it does postpone it, and the delay is a message.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former diplomat Alon Pinkas said critics failed to understand Obama's position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anyone who thinks that President Obama is a 'coward', 'hesitant', 'not a leader' and all the other fulminating epithets that will be uttered today... doesn&rsquo;t really understand America of 2013, public opinion in America in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and refuses to understand Barack Obama, the man and the president. Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t want to attack Syria. The dunghill that is otherwise known as the 'Middle East' has sucked away too much American energy, money, prestige and the presidential credibility. The remuneration has been almost nil, and the scars are still plainly visible.</p> </blockquote> <p>Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea was sympathetic to Obama's position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The power he wields is enormous, but it is not unlimited... He needs support because public opinion in America is divided, and because the military operation on the table at present won&rsquo;t solve the problem. In the best-case scenario it will deter. In the worst-case scenario, it will prove that Assad can survive an American attack.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-182e7c47-7b9a-4fe9-add1-bb9988abd87b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/1/1378032482725/da960ca8-1d21-4dca-920e-955cb3b8070d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Israeli soldier rides an armoured personnel carrier (APC) during a drill in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, 1 September, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>An Israeli soldier rides an armoured personnel carrier (APC) during a drill in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, 1 September, 2013.

Welcome to Middle East Live.</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the latest developments:</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress\"><strong>A&nbsp;US military&nbsp;attack against&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;was unexpectedly put on hold on Saturday, after president&nbsp;Barack Obama&nbsp;said that while he backed the use of force after what he called \"the worst&nbsp;chemical weapons&nbsp;attack of 21st century\", he would first seek the approval of Congress</strong></a>.&nbsp;He said Congressional leaders had agreed to hold a vote when lawmakers return to Washington next week.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/barack-obama-syria-congress-vote\"><strong>With a vote not scheduled to take place until the week beginning 9&nbsp;September, when members return from recess,&nbsp;Obama faces days of intense political debate over the evidence of a chemical weapons attack perpetrated by the Syrian government and the rationale for military strikes with limited international support.</strong></a> Republican and Democratic leaders may be expected to back the president's call for military action, but support among lawmakers, who have become increasingly restive in recent months, is by no means guaranteed.</p> <p>&bull;<strong><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/experts-leave-syria-us-edges-strike-20125224\">&nbsp;A Syrian state-run newspaper described Obama's decision to seek Congressional approval as \"the start of the historical American retreat.\"</a>&nbsp;</strong>In a front-page editorial today, the al-Thawra daily says Obama's reluctance to carry out strikes against Syria stems from his \"sense of implicit defeat and the disappearance of his allies.\" It also says the U.S. president worries about limited intervention turning into \"an open war has pushed him to seek Congress' consent.\"&nbsp;Al-Thawra is a government newspaper and its editorials reflect the thinking of President Bashar Assad's regime.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/syria-damascus-us-missile-attack\"><strong>Syrian officials have said that&nbsp;the indecision over the US and European response to a chemical attack in eastern Damascus has exposed the limitations of Syria's foes</strong></a>.&nbsp;Brigadier Turki al-Hassan, a retired air force officer, told the Observer that the British vote against military action had resonated widely in Damascus. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have welcomed the British decision and we salute the parliament which stopped this aggressive act against Syria. We consider it to be a rational decision, which takes into consideration Britain's benefit, because if they wanted to go for war then maybe they would ignite something that they couldn't stop. They can easily start a war. But they can't control what happens next.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; <strong>France, the only other country apart from the US, that has indicated that it will take military action against Syria, has said it will not act alone but wait the US decision.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-01T09:38:42.339+01:00\">at 9.38am BST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Kerry says Obama 'has the right' to strike Syria without Congress –  as it happened","trailText":"<p>Follow live updates as the world reacts to Barack Obama's decision to seek the approval of Congress for the use of force against the Assad regime</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/1/1378023837389/870f8ca2-a153-4f21-a069-86ed1b8beea2-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"6837","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"416253155","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"5222f910e4b03491b6ac8479","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Haroon Siddique and Tom McCarthy","displayRelativeTimes":"true","internalPageCode":"1958724","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-04T08:39:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/syria-crisis-reaction-obama-decision-military-action","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/01/syria-crisis-reaction-obama-decision-military-action","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

In reality, it is pretty clear the UK government would like a negotiated political outcome to the Syria conflict. It knows the alternative is a dangerous destabilisation of the Middle East.</p> <p>However, on occasions, its positions and statements have not always matched this ambition. You cannot call for regime change (however desirable) and expect that regime to cooperate in a political process. You cannot object to the involvement of a key player such as Iran just because, for other reasons, you wish to isolate it.</p> <p>If you see Russia as central to pressuring the Assad regime, you cannot isolate it by creating a Friends of Syria Group that Moscow sees as anti-Russian.

While the UK welcomed Bahrain&rsquo;s decision to review these cases in a civilian court, as recommended by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), we remain concerned about the strength of the convictions. Reports at the time these individuals were sentenced, which were acknowledged by the BICI, suggested that some had been abused in detention, denied access to legal counsel and were coerced into confessing.</p> <p>I urge the Bahraini government to ensure the human rights and freedoms of its citizens are fully upheld at all times. We are aware that the defendants can now appeal to the cassation court. We expect this process to be conducted thoroughly and with urgency, whilst ensuring due legal process is followed. We will continue to monitor the appeal process very closely.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5e717ad9-89ca-4be0-8d7f-84ac3d08b155\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346769394361/7d6cacda-27e6-4b42-a864-9b7c781bf27d-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Security personnel stood guard outside the court when life sentences against activists were upheld.

He has abandoned his dental practice and is now running a secret hospital. This is what he told her:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm in charge of a makeshift hospital in one of the districts in Damascus. In fact it is difficult to describe it as a makeshift hospital, it lacks all the requirements for such a hospital. It does not have an operating theatre but only first aid stuff.</p> <p>Originally I'm a dentist specialising in jaws and face surgery. I'm the only doctor in my district. Most of the doctors are either scared of the regime's oppression or have left the country.</p> <p>I used to work in a government hospital and have my own clinic. In 2011, I was reported to the security for taking part in the protest against the regime. My clinic was stormed at 11 in the morning but thank God I was out. I had to abandon my clinic as well my home after it was raided and my father and two of my brothers were detained for a month.</p> <p>The security told my father to phone me claiming that he had hit a man with his car and needed me to come, but he refused.</p> <p>Since that time, I decide to devote myself to the revolution and establish the so-called \"medical suitcase\". I wanted to help the protesters who get shot at the demonstrations and cannot go to the hospital.</p> <p>A young guy who was only 17 years old was shot in his leg a few months ago during one of the protests. The district was besieged by the security forces, the guy kept bleeding and we could not reach him till he died. His case was not that complicated but nobody could help.</p> <p>So we started going to the places where the wounded are if they cannot come to us. Most of the wounded are scared to go to the government hospitals for fear of detention or killing. When I used to work in the government hospital it had turned to a military barracks, full of intelligence people.</p> <p>I only work with a nursing staff. It's so difficult to find doctors &ndash; sometimes it takes us two days to find a surgeon who can operate on one of the cases or I have to take the wounded to his clinic by myself.</p> <p>We had an orthopaedic doctor who used to help us, but he left for Jordan. Some of my colleague who are qualified in general surgery are in detention.</p> <p>Sometimes we are lucky and can find a surgeon ... but it depends on the case itself &ndash; whether [the wound] is in the chest or the abdomen &ndash; in addition to the security situation.</p> <p>In the beginning I sat up my hospital in a mosque but it was targeted by the Syrian army when they stormed the district. We were forced to move to one of the houses where we work secretly.</p> <p>If there is a heavy presence of Syrian forces it is difficult to move the wounded &ndash; they will be stopped by the security. We ourselves cannot go to areas where there are many security forces.</p> <p>I did an operation on a wounded man yesterday at one o'clock in the morning. He had already had surgery in his abdomen but the wound was infected. We smuggled him in and right after the operation we brought him back. We were worried the security would recognise him.</p> <p>I also coordinate with other organisations to get medical supplies. We do not have that good support when it comes to the number of the doctors who work with and outside support. All I get is promises that I will receive a help but nothing so far. I do not have the most simple equipment a doctor need like a monitor or sterilisation machine. I gathered my medical supply from different places.</p> <p>Either I do a \"medical suitcase\", which means I take my bag with me and go to the wounded, or I set up a makeshift hospital somewhere to receive the wounded and stitch their wounds or provide first aid to stabilise their condition.</p> <p>For a year now, I have been asking for basic medical equipment from people who are abroad, but all I get is promises. I need a portable X-ray machine cause many of the cases are injured limbs.</p> <p>Most of the limb injuries which do not hit the an artery, like broken bones, I can deal with. I can stop the bleeding and give the wounded antibiotics and painkillers. I save their life with what I have. I cannot treat injuries in the chest and abdomen &ndash; they need surgical intervention in a theatre. </p> <p>I receive lots of people injured by mortar shells. I have today a case of a family whose flat was hit by a mortars shell, the parents were killed at once, but the two female kids were wounded. I treated one of them, but her sister died soon afterwards.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5045f0b8c0e35a003915c3e7\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-05T09:26:00.615+01:00\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Warning about 'undeletable' text messages</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not sure what this is all about, but the Syrian information ministry has <a href=\"http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/09/04/439484.htm\">issued a warning</a> about \"undeletable\" text messages:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The information ministry warns citizens that messages are being sent to cell phones that cannot be deleted without typing the word \"agree\" and cause technical issues in the phone if they are rejected.</p> <p>The Ministry affirmed that these messages are an attempt at political and media exploitation carried out by foreign sides known for their animosity towards Syria.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5045ebfec0e35a003915c3de\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-05T09:26:00.615+01:00\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Military call-up not going to plan – Reuters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters reports on the Syrian government's efforts over the last couple of months to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/04/us-syria-crisis-army-deserters-idUSBRE8830CH20120904\">call up army reservists</a> and &ndash; anecdotally &ndash; the difficulties it faces in doing so.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Several fleeing reservists and a serving army officer told Reuters that thousands of men had been called up in the past two months to bolster the 300,000 strong army, and many of them are failing to report for duty.</p> <p>\"We have two choices: Stay and kill fellow Syrians, or desert, and be on the run from military courts,\" said a legal assistant summoned for duty in Damascus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among those interviewed is an Alawite from Tartous:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fadi, a former artillery specialist, said he was called by the army for active duty and given 48 hours to prepare to leave his coastal city of Tartous.</p> <p>\"I was terrified.

He also rejected Assad's suggestion that he would have 30 days, under the standard terms of the chemical weapons treaty, to declare his stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said. \"And the words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\"</p><p>The joint press conference between Kerry and Lavrov marked the start of an uncomfortable alliance between the US and Russia, after the two countries unexpectedly converged around a proposal to disarm Syria of its chemical stockpiles. Delegations of Russian and American technical experts are in the Swiss capital to discuss the mechanics of the disarmament plan, which would involve Syria identifying the locations of its stockpiles and handing over control to the international community. </p><p>Washington is seeking to shift responsibility for the success of any weapons destruction programme to Moscow. US officials argue that the plans for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons were put forward by Russia, and says its \"prestige\" is now at stake. \"This is not a game. It has to be real,\" Kerry said in Geneva.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/sep/12/assad-ready-handover-syria-chemical-weapons-video\">Assad told Russian television</a> Syria would submit documents to the UN for an agreement governing the handover of its chemical arsenal. \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The US threats did not influence the decision,\" Interfax said, quoting the state-run Rossiya-24 channel's yet-to-be-aired interview.</p><p>The White House and State Department both indicated on Thursday that the US was treating Assad's promise with scepticism. In Geneva, Kerry said: \"It is too early to tell whether these efforts will succeed, but the technical challenges of trying to do this in the context of the civil war are obviously immense. But despite how difficult this is, with the collaboration of our experts, and only with the compliance of the Assad regime, we do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>A senior state department official accompanying the Kerry delegation said the US and Russia both had technical expertise in chemical weapons destruction because of the two-decade process – which is still ongoing – to destroy cold war-era stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We also have experience in doing destruction of chemical weapons in the face of a resistant environment,\" the official said. \"That is Iraq in the 1990s. And we have recent and ongoing experience, successful experience, in the case of a cooperative government. That is Libya, which we expect within the next few months will complete the destruction of its stockpiles left over from the previous regime.\"<br /> <br />The senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity, as occurs routinely in US administration briefings. </p><p>Kerry said Syrian weapons destruction would need to be credible, comprehensive, verifiable and implemented quickly, and added that there would need to be \"consequences\" for Assad if he did not comply with his obligations. He did not specify whether such consequences would involve the use of force against Syria. </p><p>However, he also said that the credible threat of military action had forced Syria into conceding that it possessed chemical weapons and agreeing to their destruction, and maintained that the threat of strikes remained. Lavrov said that the securing of Syria's chemical weapons \"will make unnecessary any strike against the Syrian Arab Republic\".</p><p>After Kerry spoke, Lavrorv appeared to admonish him for making political comments. \"Diplomacy likes silence,\" Lavrov said. Kerry did not hear the translation and asked for it to be repeated. Lavrov said in English: \"It's okay, John.\" Kerry laughed and replied: \"You want me to take your word for it. It's a little early for that.\"</p><p>Aside from the jokes, Kerry adopted softer language than has recently been used by the Obama administration, saying only that \"force might be necessary\" to deter Assad from using his weapons if the diplomatic route failed.</p><p>The question over whether force could be authorised, in the event that Syria did not comply with chemical weapons actions, is at the centre of negotiations at the UN in New York, where a possible resolution is being drafted. </p><p>Lavrov added that Russia's position on Syria had been laid out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-op-ed-author-ketchum-nyt\"> president Vladimir Putin's op-ed article in the New York Times</a>. \"I am convinced that all of you have read this article,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>In the article, Putin welcomed the new diplomatic initiative over Syria but condemned a US tendency toward unilateral \"brute force\" and sharply criticised America's belief in its own \"exceptionalism\". The article caused consternation in Washington.</p><p>The Republican senator John McCain said the article was \"an insult to the intelligence of every American\", while the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, said of reading the piece: \"I almost wanted to vomit.\"</p><p>The US administration chose more diplomatic language. A State Department deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the time had come for Putin to \"put forward actions now, not just words\".</p><p>The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"The important thing is that both in his op-ed and in his statements and actions, president Putin has invested his credibility in the transfer of Assad's chemical weapons.\"</p><p>He added: \"[Nevertheless] there's a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition in this country of freedom of expression – something on the decrease in the last dozen or so years in Russia.\"</p><p>Carney said the White House would not tolerate any delay by the Syrian government and would continue to provide military assistance to rebel groups throughout the process.</p>","headline":"Syria crisis: Kerry cautiously optimistic over chemical weapons surrender","trailText":"<p>Secretary of state begins Geneva talks with Russian counterpart and says: 'We do believe there is a way to get this done'</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1379019238052/John-Kerry-005.jpg","wordcount":"1093","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417166585","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paul Lewis and Dan Roberts in Washington","internalPageCode":"1964797","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T21:01:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/john-kerry-syria-chemical-weapons-surrender","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/john-kerry-syria-chemical-weapons-surrender","tags":[{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that both sides were serious about the negotiations despite some differences over the plan. But he warned: \"This is not a game. It has to be real.\"</p><p>With its letter to the UN, Syria was poised to become the the 190th member of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), leaving a small group of nations outside the treaty: Israel, Burma, Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan. Syrian membership will take effect 30 days after the delivery of the letter. After that Syria would be legally committed to ridding itself of its chemical arsenal.</p><p>However, in a Russian television interview, Assad also appeared to put conditions on Syria's chemical disarmament, saying the US would have to reciprocate by ceasing military threats against his government and the arming of \"terrorists\".</p><p>Assad's comments emphasised the significant diplomatic obstacles facing US and Russian diplomats and chemical weapons experts as they began meetings in Geneva to discuss Moscow's plan to disarm the Syrian government. According to the Russian Kommersant newspaper, the plan would involve four stages: Syria would sign the CWC, then declare its stockpile and production facilities, invite weapons inspectors in, and cooperate with them in drawing up a plan to destroy the stockpile.</p><p>That arsenal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-french-intelligence-assad\">according to a French intelligence estimate this month</a>, amounts to more than 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents and precursors, including mustard gas as well as sarin and VX nerve agents.</p><p>Speaking in Geneva, Kerry acknowledged that there would be \"immense technical challenges\" in implementing the plan. But he told Lavrov: \"We are serious, as you are, about engaging in substantive, meaningful negotiations.\" He repeated Washington's position that there had to be \"consequences\" if Syria failed to follow through on its commitments and said that US military assets would remain in place.</p><p>In an op-ed published in the New York Times on Wednesday night, Russian president Vladimir Putin restated Moscow's claim that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\">the chemical attacks in Damascus on 21 August which triggered the current global crisis</a> were the work of rebel forces, but he did not cite evidence.</p><p>A UN investigation into the attack is expected to produce a report early next week. <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/11/un_report_will_finger_assad_for_massive_chemical_attack\">The Foreign Policy online magazine quoted a senior western official</a> as saying the report, by Swedish scientist Åke Sellström, would include a \"wealth\" of evidence pointing at the culpability of the Assad regime. American officials said that they would insist on a brisk timetable to ensure the plan did not become a time-buying ploy.</p><p>While the diplomats talked in Geneva, the US and Russia continued to build up their naval forces in the Mediterranean. Russia has dispatched a \"carrier killer\" missile cruiser and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean, in its largest naval deployment since Soviet times.</p><p>The destroyer Smetlivy left a naval base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on Tuesday, on a mission to the Syrian coast, a military source told the state news agency Interfax on Thursday. The source said the Smetlivy would travel to the Mediterranean with the amphibious assault ship Nikolai Filchenkov, which left Novorossiysk on Monday carrying unidentified supplies for the Damascus government. The missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, is also on its way to the Syrian coast to lead the Russian force there. The ship is reportedly known as a \"carrier-killer\" because it is outfitted with Vulkan missiles, which are designed to destroy large ships.</p><p>The former Democratic US senator Sam Nunn, who is one of the world's leading arms-control campaigners, said the disarmament process would have a chance of succeeding only if the Syrian army is in charge of the arsenal.</p><p>\"We hope that the Syrian army is in control. The US government believes it is. The Russians disagree. If the Russians are right and some of the rebels have control, the nightmare's just started,\" said Nunn, speaking to The Guardian in Brussels.</p>","headline":"Syria takes step to surrender chemical weapons as US keeps up pressure","trailText":"<p>Secretary of state John Kerry discusses US-Russia talks in Geneva and says: 'This is not a game.

with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-chemical-weapons-un-us-russia\">Appearing alongside Lavrov, shortly after the beginning of two days of negotiations</a>, Kerry acknowledged that expectations were high but said: \"We do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>As the talks got under way in Geneva, the United Nations announced that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had signed a legislative decree making his country party to the chemical weapons convention.</p><p>\"In their letter, the Syrian authorities have expressed their commitment to observe the obligations entailed by the convention even before its entry into force for Syria,\" a UN spokesperson said. \"Given recent events, he hopes that the current talks in Geneva will lead to speedy agreement on a way forward which will be endorsed and assisted by the international community.\"</p><p>Kerry insisted that the threat of military action against Syria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\">over a chemical weapons attack in the country on 21 August</a>, remained an option. He also rejected Assad's suggestion that he would have 30 days, under the standard terms of the chemical weapons treaty, to declare his stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said. \"And the words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\"</p><p>The joint press conference between Kerry and Lavrov marked the start of an uncomfortable alliance between the US and Russia, after the two countries unexpectedly converged around a proposal to disarm Syria of its chemical stockpiles. Delegations of Russian and American technical experts are in the Swiss capital to discuss the mechanics of the disarmament plan, which would involve Syria identifying the locations of its stockpiles and handing over control to the international community. </p><p>Washington is seeking to shift responsibility for the success of any weapons destruction programme to Moscow. US officials argue that the plans for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons were put forward by Russia, and says its \"prestige\" is now at stake. \"This is not a game. It has to be real,\" Kerry said in Geneva.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/sep/12/assad-ready-handover-syria-chemical-weapons-video\">Assad told Russian television</a> Syria would submit documents to the UN for an agreement governing the handover of its chemical arsenal. \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The US threats did not influence the decision,\" Interfax said, quoting the state-run Rossiya-24 channel's yet-to-be-aired interview.</p><p>The White House and State Department both indicated on Thursday that the US was treating Assad's promise with scepticism. In Geneva, Kerry said: \"It is too early to tell whether these efforts will succeed, but the technical challenges of trying to do this in the context of the civil war are obviously immense. But despite how difficult this is, with the collaboration of our experts, and only with the compliance of the Assad regime, we do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>A senior state department official accompanying the Kerry delegation said the US and Russia both had technical expertise in chemical weapons destruction because of the two-decade process – which is still ongoing – to destroy cold war-era stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We also have experience in doing destruction of chemical weapons in the face of a resistant environment,\" the official said. \"That is Iraq in the 1990s. And we have recent and ongoing experience, successful experience, in the case of a cooperative government. That is Libya, which we expect within the next few months will complete the destruction of its stockpiles left over from the previous regime.\"<br /> <br />The senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity, as occurs routinely in US administration briefings. </p><p>Kerry said Syrian weapons destruction would need to be credible, comprehensive, verifiable and implemented quickly, and added that there would need to be \"consequences\" for Assad if he did not comply with his obligations. He did not specify whether such consequences would involve the use of force against Syria. </p><p>However, he also said that the credible threat of military action had forced Syria into conceding that it possessed chemical weapons and agreeing to their destruction, and maintained that the threat of strikes remained. Lavrov said that the securing of Syria's chemical weapons \"will make unnecessary any strike against the Syrian Arab Republic\".</p><p>After Kerry spoke, Lavrorv appeared to admonish him for making political comments. \"Diplomacy likes silence,\" Lavrov said. Kerry did not hear the translation and asked for it to be repeated. Lavrov said in English: \"It's okay, John.\" Kerry laughed and replied: \"You want me to take your word for it. It's a little early for that.\"</p><p>Aside from the jokes, Kerry adopted softer language than has recently been used by the Obama administration, saying only that \"force might be necessary\" to deter Assad from using his weapons if the diplomatic route failed.</p><p>The question over whether force could be authorised, in the event that Syria did not comply with chemical weapons actions, is at the centre of negotiations at the UN in New York, where a possible resolution is being drafted. </p><p>Lavrov added that Russia's position on Syria had been laid out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-op-ed-author-ketchum-nyt\"> president Vladimir Putin's op-ed article in the New York Times</a>. \"I am convinced that all of you have read this article,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>In the article, Putin welcomed the new diplomatic initiative over Syria but condemned a US tendency toward unilateral \"brute force\" and sharply criticised America's belief in its own \"exceptionalism\". The article caused consternation in Washington.</p><p>The Republican senator John McCain said the article was \"an insult to the intelligence of every American\", while the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, said of reading the piece: \"I almost wanted to vomit.\"</p><p>The US administration chose more diplomatic language. A State Department deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the time had come for Putin to \"put forward actions now, not just words\".</p><p>The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"The important thing is that both in his op-ed and in his statements and actions, president Putin has invested his credibility in the transfer of Assad's chemical weapons.\"</p><p>He added: \"[Nevertheless] there's a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition in this country of freedom of expression – something on the decrease in the last dozen or so years in Russia.\"</p><p>Carney said the White House would not tolerate any delay by the Syrian government and would continue to provide military assistance to rebel groups throughout the process.</p>","headline":"Syria crisis: Kerry cautiously optimistic over chemical weapons surrender","trailText":"<p>Secretary of state begins Geneva talks with Russian counterpart and says: 'We do believe there is a way to get this done'</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1379019238052/John-Kerry-005.jpg","wordcount":"1093","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417166585","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paul Lewis and Dan Roberts in Washington","internalPageCode":"1964797","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T21:01:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/john-kerry-syria-chemical-weapons-surrender","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/john-kerry-syria-chemical-weapons-surrender","tags":[{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Here's an excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The international consensus that the regime was responsible [for the chemical attack] is growing. During the G20 eleven nations including the UK signed a statement condemning the regime&rsquo;s use of chemical weapons and supporting efforts by the US and other countries to reinforce the prohibition against chemical weapons use. A week later that statement has now been signed by 25 countries.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Saturday I attended the EU Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Vilnius, which unanimously agreed that there was strong evidence of regime culpability, and that &lsquo;in the face of this cynical use of chemical weapons, the international community cannot remain idle.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />This growing international pressure, including the threat of military action by the US, has had an impact.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Monday I hosted Secretary Kerry for detailed discussions on the way forward. On the same day the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov announced that Russia would urge the Syrian regime to sign up to a proposal which would place their chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction. In response, the regime announced that it supported the initiative and was ready to cooperate; and that it intended to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, open up its sites and give up its chemical weapons.<br />&nbsp;<br />Given their track record, any commitment made by the Syrian regime must be treated with great caution. This is a regime that has lied for years about possessing chemical weapons, that still denies it has used them, and that refused for four months to allow UN inspectors into Syria.<br />&nbsp;<br />Nevertheless, as the Prime Minister has said, we have to take this proposal seriously and test its sincerity. If the Syrian regime verifiably gave up its chemical weapons stockpiles this would obviously be a major step forward. We agree with President Obama that this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.</p> <p>Intensive discussions are now taking place about how to achieve this, and Secretary Kerry is meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss the proposal.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft Security Council resolution, and the five permanent members of the Security Council met for consultations last night. A resolution must establish a binding commitment for the Syrian regime to give up its chemical weapons within a specific timeframe. We will hold further discussions in the Security Council once the UN inspectors have reported.<br />&nbsp;<br />The United Kingdom will make every effort to negotiate an enforceable agreement that credibly, reliably, and promptly places the regime&rsquo;s chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction.<br />&nbsp;<br />The House should be in no doubt of the scale of the challenge and the immense practical difficulties that would need to be overcome.<br />&nbsp;<br />It would require the genuine cooperation of a regime that denied until recently that it possessed these weapons and has used them ruthlessly against its own people on at least 14 occasions, killing many hundreds of people including women and children. The regime has a large number of sites &ndash; possibly the largest stock of chemical weapons possessed by any nation in the world &ndash; in numerous different locations in a country that is a contested battlefield. We would need to have confidence that all chemical weapons had been identified and secured and that they could not fall into the wrong hands.<br />&nbsp;<br />These issues can all be overcome with sufficient international unity and goodwill, and provided there is a complete change of approach by the Assad regime to all of its past practices and deceptions.<br />&nbsp;<br />So we will approach these negotiations with determination and resolve, knowing that if successful it would be an important breakthrough, but that overcoming all these issues will not be easy and that in the meantime thousands of Syrians are dying every month from conventional weapons in this worsening conflict.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is abundantly clear that this diplomatic opening would not have come about had the international community shown complacency or disregard for the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and that pressure on the regime must be maintained.<br />&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52319602e4b0a811a627c8eb\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:44:23.470+01:00\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hague calls for binding UN resolution</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for a tough UN resolution to hold Syria to its commitment to hand over its chemical weapons.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons, Hague said he was wary of Syria's promises and that dealing with the Assad's regime's chemical stockpiles posed \"immense practical difficulties\". He said: \"We will need to have confidence that all chemical weapons have been identified and secured and that they would not fall into the wrong hands.\"</p> <p>But the foreign secretary said the initiative presented a \"diplomatic opening\" that would not have come about without international pressure to hold the Syrian government to account for last month's chemical weapons attack.</p> <p>Hague said: \"Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft security council resolution ...

US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for talks in Geneva on a plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control.</p> <p>Here's a round up of the latest developments:</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/us-syria-russian-chemical-weapons-handover\"><strong>The US has welcomed what it called \"very specific\" Russian proposals to secure the handover of Syria's chemical weapons before key talks in Geneva on Thursday.</strong></a> The White House urged patience and said it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by \"putting their prestige on the line\". \"We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,\" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/russia-offers-four-step-plan-for-syria-arms-handover-report.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=54312&amp;NewsCatID=359\"><strong>Russia has proposed a four-stage plan for Syria to hand over its weapons, according to AFP citing the Russian daily Kommersant. </strong></a>Under the plan Syria would:</p> <ol> <li>Join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] the body that upholds the international ban</li> <li>Disclose the location of chemical stockpiles</li> <li>Allow OPCW inspectors access to the sites</li> <li>Destroy the stockpile of weapons</li> </ol> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24058006\">The five permanent UN security council members have met in New York to discuss the Russian plan, the BBC reports.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US, UK and French diplomats held separate talks before the meeting of the so-called P5 envoys. The meeting lasted less than an hour and envoys declined to comment as they left.</p> <p>The French have already been working on a draft resolution that would be enforced by Chapter VII of the UN charter, which would in effect sanction the use of force if Syria failed in its obligations.</p> <p>However, Russia has already indicated that this would be unacceptable, as would any resolution blaming the Syrian government for chemical attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has drawn a contrast between what he portrayed as Russia's diplomatic approach to Syria and the Obama administration's talk of military intervention.</a>&nbsp;</strong>He also claimed Barack Obama's talk of US exceptionalism was \"dangerous\".&nbsp;Writing in the New York Times he warned:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it ...</p> <p>From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today&rsquo;s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos.</p> <p>We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/11/un_report_will_finger_assad_for_massive_chemical_attack\"><strong>UN inspectors investigating last month's chemical attack east of Damascus have compiled enough circumstantial evidence to suggest the Assad regime was responsible, diplomats have told Foreign Policy's The Cable blog.</strong></a> \"You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author,\" one said.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/aleppo-rebels-angry-diplomacy-assad\"><strong>The US shift from planning an attack on the Assad regime to diplomacy has prompted despair and anger among rebels in Aleppo, Martin Chulov reports from the city.&nbsp;</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebels of the north held out hope that real help would arrive some time. \"We were depending on this,\" said Sheikh Omar Otthman, a leader of the Liwa al-Tawheed brigade, the main opposition militia in Aleppo, of the now uncertain international intervention. \"The suffering of the people of Ghouta could have created an opportunity for all our suffering to be lifted\" ...</p> <p>\"They've spent the past two weeks saying Bashar is a liar and must be punished and that he needs to know that he can't get away with what he does,\" said Abu Hamza, a former colonel in the Syrian military who became a central figure in the war for the north soon after it began.</p> <p>\"And then they give him a chance to do more of what he has always done, get away with murder. He will stall them, trick them and wear them down. And they will send the ships home. And we'll be left alone.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:25:06.332+01:00\">at 11.25am BST</time></p>  </div>","headline":"Syria claims 'full membership' in global chemical weapons ban – as it happened","trailText":"Follow live updates as the US and Russia discuss plans place Syria's chemical weapons under international control","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378989185127/afb98a6f-8c4f-4f90-b9fc-c736d2eff43c-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"7933","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417092960","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52316c81e4b0c9a06407dbd1","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Matthew Weaver and Tom McCarthy","displayRelativeTimes":"true","internalPageCode":"1964180","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-13T10:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-crisis-russia-us-talks-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-crisis-russia-us-talks-live","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

In spite of this fundamental disagreement, they were both relieved that President Obama has suspended his plan to launch missiles against Syria. \"About half of our neighbours think the same. A similar number are still worried that he might attack later. No attack will bring any good. A few people want Obama to do it, but it's a sign of how frustrated and desperate they are with the lack of jobs and the misery of the way we have to live now. They just want to have everything finished off, even if they end up being killed themselves,\" said Saeed.</p><p>An older relative, who also initially supported the uprising, made the point starkly: \"Negotiations are useless. I hope Obama strikes us all, us and the government, then we'll all be dead.\"</p><p>In the better-off districts of central Damascus, relief clearly outweighs such grim despair. Two weeks ago, when a US attack seemed imminent, people rushed to the shops to stock up on essentials. They stayed at home in the evenings. But now the cafes are full again and mothers push babies in buggies in the cool after dusk along tree-lined streets. Young people window-gaze in a pedestrian area full of fashion boutiques near the parliament building.</p><p>Even as the poorer districts fill up with escapees from the bombing of Ghouta and other outlying areas to the south and west, the city centre is emptier than it was in February. The wealthy have gone to Beirut or the Gulf.</p><p>The government has lifted travel bans on a number of people who supported the peaceful protests and demonstrations of 2011 in an apparent bid to get the politically active to leave. \"I was taken in for interrogation by a security force general last month,\" said one female activist. \"He was very polite, and at the end told me I had permission to go abroad. You don't need to return, he added.\"</p><p>Disappointed that Obama has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/obama-diplomatic-path-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">postponed the air strikes</a>, which she felt should have been launched as part of a no-fly zone long before the chemical weapons furore, she was astonished that Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, had agreed to abandon the country's chemical arsenal. \"In one move, Assad has thrown away years of effort in building [the chemical weapons] up, as well as his claim to be part of the resistance to Israel. They always said they needed them because Israel has nuclear weapons. Now he's giving them up to save his skin. It shows his cynicism.\"</p><p>In the Christian part of the walled Old City, Mirna Medaa, a hotel receptionist, was unhappy that Syria had abandoned its chemical weapons. \"We don't believe our president or the Syrian army used them, but it's not good to give them up. Israel has the biggest arsenal of chemical weapons in the world, as well as nuclear ones. The US has their defences. Why should we give ours up? I hope we have peace. If there is a peace agreement, then we won't need to use them.\"</p><p>Syria's pro-government media do not disguise their satisfaction that the US attacks have been put on hold. But they mainly avoid gloating or describing it as victory. Nasser Mundher, a columnist in al Thawra, the official Ba'ath party paper, wrote yesterday: \"The people who wanted to destroy Syria and were applauding the plan to attack are shocked now. They're holding their breath and hope it will still happen, but Russia's plan has stopped the attacks and given Obama a safe let-out from the problem he created for himself by drawing red lines and making threats.\"</p><p>Some Damascenes say they never thought Obama was serious about attacking Syria. Louai Hussein, who heads Building the Syrian State, a civil society group that campaigns for democratic reforms and has long criticised the way the opposition took up arms, believes the US is manoeuvring before the long-delayed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/friends-syria-talks-geneva-peace-conference\" title=\"\">Geneva II conference </a>on Syria. Hussein is convinced John Kerry's suggestion at a press conference in London that Syria could avoid the air strikes if it gave up chemical weapons was choreographed by President Putin with Mr Obama at the G20 summit.</p><p>\"In May the US began to feel the Syrian conflict was getting out of control and this was not in Israel's interest,\" Hussein said. \"Kerry is trying to collect more cards before Geneva. That's why he used the chemical weapons issue to produce a new card in the threat of air strikes.\"</p><p>Hussein hoped this week's talks between the Russian and US ministers will not only produce agreement on chemical weapons but moves to accelerate the convening of Geneva II – something that could end the entire war, not just the use of chemical weapons.</p>","headline":"Syrians return to streets of Damascus as threat of US strikes recedes","trailText":"Relief in Syrian capital as immediate danger passes, but many are worried that their chemical weapons have been surrendered","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1379007094667/Syrian-women-eat-ice-crea-004.jpg","wordcount":"947","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"417150477","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8066340","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele in Damascus","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1964642","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T18:00:38Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syrians-return-streets-damascus-us-strikes","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/syrians-return-streets-damascus-us-strikes","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

president appeals to Americans in New York Times article claiming intervention would unleash more terror","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:10:47Z","body":"<p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has warned against US military intervention in Syria, writing in what he called a direct address \"to the American people and their political leaders\" that it could \"increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism\".</p><p>Syria was not witnessing a battle for democracy but \"an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country\", Putin said, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html\" title=\"\">in a New York Times comment piece</a> repeating assertions that rebels rather than the government might have used chemical weapons, \"to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons\", and may be planning further attacks, even against Israel.</p><p>\"[An American attack] could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilise the Middle East and north Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.\"</p><p>Putin's article was published after the US welcomed what the Obama administration called \"very specific\" Russian proposals to secure the handover of Syria's chemical weapons before key talks in Geneva. The Russian president said recent events had \"prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders\".</p><p>In meetings planned for later on Thursday and again on Friday with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will ask Moscow to put forward a credible and verifiable plan to list, quarantine and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stocks.</p><p>Kerry is accompanied by US chemical weapons experts to look at and possibly expand on Russian ideas for the complex task of dealing safely with the vast stockpiles in the midst of the brutal and unpredictable Syrian conflict. Russian technical experts will join Lavrov in the meetings.</p><p>\"Our goal here is to test the seriousness of this proposal, to talk about the specifics of how this would get done, what are the mechanics of identifying, verifying, securing and ultimately destroying the chemical weapons,\" the state department said shortly before Kerry left Washington.</p><p>In his article, Putin welcomed Obama's consideration of the Russian-backed plan for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons and said his relationship with the US president was marked by \"growing trust\". But he warned: \"It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it.</p><p>\"Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan: 'You're either with us or against us.'\" Putin said Russia was not aiming to protect the Syrian government but international law.</p><p>The White House said on Wednesday it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by \"putting their prestige on the line\".</p><p>\"We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,\" said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p><p>\"The proposal they have put forward is very specific and the Syrian reaction is a total about-face. This is significant.\"</p><p>But the sudden thaw in White House attitudes towards Russia has met with scepticism in Washington, where many see it as an excuse for Barack Obama to avoid defeat in Congress over military action against Syria. A speech by Obama to the American people on Wednesday night was criticised by hawkish Republicans after it called for a suspension of Senate attempts to pass a resolution authorising US strikes.</p><p>The White House insisted that the Russian offer was genuine and a direct result of the pressure it had put on Syria. \"There is no question that the credible threat of US force helped bring us to this point,\" Carney said. \"By making this proposal Russia has, to its credit, put its prestige on the line when it comes to a close ally.\"</p><p>The US wants an agreement with Russia to be bolstered by a UN resolution to hold Syria accountable for using chemical weapons. The talks in Geneva between Kerry and Lavrov will not cover the wording of any resolution, but the US tried to play down a potential rift over whether it should contain the threat of military action if Syria fails to comply.</p><p>The talks will need to resolve differences between western powers and Russia over whether the disarmament process should be backed by a threat of force if the Syrian government reneges on the timetable.</p><p>Diplomats also said it was unlikely a UN security council vote would take place before the publication of a report by UN weapons inspectors on the suspected chemical weapons attack in rebel-held eastern Damascus on 21 August. That report is expected some time next week.</p><p>US, British and French diplomats continued to meet at the UN headquarters on Wednesday to discuss a French draft resolution that would give Bashar al-Assad's regime 15 days to produce an \"exhaustive, complete and definitive declaration of the locations, amount and types of all items related to its chemical warfare programme\".</p><p>The draft, according to a copy obtained by Reuters, would then order \"immediate on-site inspections of Syria's chemical, biological and related vehicles\". The full security council was due to meet later on Wednesday.</p><p>The Syrian government has acknowledged it agreed with Russia that it would sign the 1993 chemical weapons convention, deliver a full declaration of its arsenal and its locations, and provide access to UN, Russian and other inspectors.</p><p>Kerry said the US was still pushing for a UN resolution to bolster the plan which would punish Syria if it delayed or broke off the disarmament process. But he indicated he was prepared to listen to the Russian point of view.</p><p>\"We need a full resolution from the security council in order to have confidence that this has the force that it ought to have. That's our belief, and obviously the Russians are at a slightly different place. We'll have to see where we get to. I'm not going to negotiate this out in public,\" Kerry said.</p><p>The French president, François Hollande, also signalled flexibility on the wording of a resolution. A statement, released after a meeting of Hollande's defence council, said: \"The president emphasised France's determination to explore all avenues at the UN security council, in order to enable actual and verifiable control of the chemical weapons present in Syria as soon as possible.\"</p><p>France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is due in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the issue with Lavrov and may visit Beijing on Monday for talks with the Chinese government, which has been noncommittal on France's draft resolution.</p><p>• <em>Additional reporting by Paul Lewis in Washington</em></p>","headline":"Vladimir Putin warns US not to launch attack in Syria","trailText":"Russian president appeals to Americans in New York Times article claiming intervention would unleash more terror","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1378971111938/Barack-Obama-Vladimir-Put-003.jpg","wordcount":"1081","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"417092965","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8063554","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dan Roberts in Washington, Julian Borger and agencies","internalPageCode":"1964181","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T07:35:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-warns-us-not-to-attack-syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-warns-us-not-to-attack-syria","tags":[{"id":"world/vladimir-putin","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/vladimir-putin","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Both Russia and the US have been beefing up their naval presence in the Med over the past several weeks.</p><p>The destroyer Smetlivy left a naval base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on Tuesday on a mission to the Syrian coast, a military source told the state news agency Interfax on Thursday.</p><p>The source said the Smetlivy would travel to the Mediterranean with the amphibious assault ship Nikolai Filchenkov, which left Novorossiysk on Monday carrying unidentified supplies for the Damascus government.</p><p>The missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, is also on its way to the Syrian coast to lead the Russian force there. The ship is reportedly known as a \"carrier-killer\" because it is outfitted with Vulkan missiles, that are designed to destroy large ships.</p><p>Observers have speculated that the buildup is in preparation for an evacuation of Russian citizens in Syria or even to repel a possible US attack against the Assad regime. According to a scientist working on military research, who asked not to be named, the deployment will put Russia in a position to evacuate its citizens currently in Syria and serve as a deterrent against military actions by Turkey and other players in the region.</p><p>\"The demonstration of strength, the demonstration of the flag, is an additional argument for Russia to be seen as important player,\" they said. However, the Russian fleet will not be able to stop an American missile or aircraft strike against Syria, they added</p><p>Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said that the Mediterranean force is part the biggest deployment of Russian ships worldwide in the post-Soviet era. However, Pukhov denied that the concentration of ships in the eastern Mediterranean was a direct reaction to the growing tensions over the Syrian conflict.</p><p>\"The rest of the Russian navy is now exercising all over the globe, including a visit to Australia, and all of these were planned months before and are not a reaction to events in Syria … in the past two months,\" Pukhov said.</p><p>In recent months, Russian ships have also conducted training exercises in the Barents Sea and in the Pacific Ocean near Kamchatka. At the end of August, it was reported that the missile cruiser Varyag and two other ships were preparing to set out for the south Pacific to make the Russian navy's first-ever visit to Sydney and to conduct joint exercises with the Australian navy.</p><p>Moscow dispatched ships to the Med starting in late August, but officials have maintained that the deployments are routine and not part of a naval buildup. The size of the fleet there has nonetheless increased: Russian forces in the Med will grow to 11 ships by mid September, the newspaper RBC Daily reported.</p><p>The US navy deployed an additional destroyer – its fifth – to the eastern Mediterranean at the end of August. The force could launch Tomahawk missiles at targets in Syria if Barack Obama orders an attack.</p><p>Retired admiral Vladimir Komoyedov, chairman of the defence committee of the state Duma and the former commander of the Black Sea fleet, told RBC Daily that the increased Russian presence is a demonstration of force that will nonetheless not be able to match US strength in the eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>\"The fact that we're building up our forces on the Syrian coast is the normal reaction of a government whose interests there are being interfered with,\" Komoyedov said. \"But unfortunately, the force we've assembled there is made up of pretty aged ships built 30 years ago.

But no one was watching the jet. Instead the men were transfixed by a television that blared news of the latest wrangling over whether a US attack would be launched against Bashar al-Assad. Even the sound of the aircraft's firing cannon was dismissed with a mocking cheer.</p><p>\"Wait till there's a real air force up there,\" said a young defector who had fought with the rebels of northern Syria for the past year. \"The regime will be far more scared of the Americans than we are of them.\"</p><p>That was late last week. By early  Wednesday, however, the rebels' mood had changed radically. \"We should have known better than to believe them,\" the group's commander told the Guardian despondently.</p><p>News that a mooted attack on the Assad regime had been put on hold and replaced with a diplomatic push has been met with despair and, in some cases, anger in and around Aleppo, where a grinding, gruelling war of attrition has become a way of life.</p><p>Battered by bombs, Scud missiles and the tank shells that thump randomly into buildings most days, Aleppo's stone heart has steadily crumbled. So too have the concrete suburbs of the east, which giant missiles have emptied of people. Newly arrived jihadists have added to the misery, splintering a cause that locals believe is theirs alone to fight and trying to turn the Syrian civil war into an arena for the settling of ancient scores.</p><p>Throughout it all, though, the rebels of the north held out hope that real help would arrive some time. \"We were depending on this,\" said Sheikh Omar Otthman, a leader of the Liwa al-Tawheed brigade, the main opposition militia in Aleppo, of the now uncertain international intervention. \"The suffering of the people of Ghouta could have created an opportunity for all our suffering to be lifted.\"</p><p>Every twist in the fast-shifting international response to the chemical attack in eastern Damascus three weeks ago has been eagerly digested in opposition communities here. But the latest has convinced many that, despite the fuss, no one had been serious about helping them.</p><p>\"They've spent the past two weeks saying Bashar is a liar and must be punished and that he needs to know that he can't get away with what he does,\" said Abu Hamza, a former colonel in the Syrian military who became a central figure in the war for the north soon after it began.</p><p>\"And then they give him a chance to do more of what he has always done, get away with murder. He will stall them, trick them and wear them down. And they will send the ships home. And we'll be left alone.\"</p><p>In the town of al-Bab, a hub of the opposition to the north-east of Aleppo, phones have not worked for almost a year and electricity can be off for days. The town's unswept streets, which are now home to a growing number of black-robed extremists, echo to the sound of generators and clapped-out motorbikes.</p><p>\"We want to chase them out, but we need the Americans to help us,\" said Tawfik Merza of the aloof strangers among them. \"They are not from us, and they're not for us.\"</p><p>The standoff with the extremists is an unwanted distraction in al-Bab, which continues to be hit with the full range of the Syrian military's arsenal – except for chemicals.</p><p>In the early hours of Sunday, a large ballistic missile struck farmland north-east of Aleppo, the first for several months and a pointed reminder that a powerful enemy was still out there. The impact was soon followed by the roar of a fighter jet above the blacked-out town. The next day, Liwa al-Tawheed leaders and cadres stood among fig trees not far from where the missile landed, excitedly plucking fruit, their rifles resting against tree trunks. One fighter offered up a peeled fig. \"They're the best fruit you can eat,\" he said. \"Delicious, and healthy. Even in war there is still good.\"</p><p>Another fighter, Abu Hamza, said the missile showed Bashar was still in control. \"It shows he is still making decisions. There are three pillars of the Syrian military that we knew to be their strategic assets. The first was the use of the air force, the second was the ballistic missiles, and the third was the chemical weapons. To use any of those things, the permission must come from the commander-in-chief.\"</p><p>Few military commanders or civic leaders here doubt that the Syrian president still has control over his military chiefs. To those running the war here, he also holds sway over a reluctant US and Europe that is proving itself pliable in the hands of Syria's allies.</p><p>\"Don't they know that to negotiate after threatening force is to show that you are weak?\" said Abu Tayeb, a member of the governing council of one of the area's main militias.</p><p>To some, however – those who hang on to hope that the Russian-backed proposal to force Syria to give up its stockpile is a ploy to build further consensus to attack – the recent developments do not let the regime off the hook.</p><p>\"He has surrendered before a shot has been fired,\" said one senior supporter of the Syrian opposition. \"If he carries through with this promise to give up his weapons, he is handing over the most important strategic deterrent that he has.

But it has to be swift, it has to be real, it has to be verifiable. We have to show Syria, Russia and the world we are not going to fall for stalling tactics.\"</p><p>US officials later said that Kerry would meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday for further talks. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Lavrov and Kerry spoke by telephone and the two \"agreed to continue contacts, including the possibility of holding a personal meeting in the coming days.\"</p><p>David Cameron delivered the same message in Westminster, saying the UK did not want the Russian disarmament proposal to be \"some delaying tactic, some ruse to buy time for a regime that must act on chemical weapons\".</p><p>Referring to the planned UN resolution, the prime minister said \"there would have to be consequences\" if it wasn't done.</p><p>However, the western powers' tough rhetoric is weakened by the lack of enthusiasm at home for military action. Parliament has ruled out British involvement in punitive strikes, and Barack Obama faces stiff resistance in Congress.</p><p>\"I think there is a high risk of another car crash at the security council,\" said Richard Gowan of the centre for international co-operation at New York University. \"It will be very, very difficult for Obama to accept a resolution that doesn't involve a threat to Assad. Putin is daring him to walk away from the UN and go back to Washington, knowing he can't count on support there. The Russians hope that when he's faced with that trap he will climb down.\"</p><p>The White House abandoned its earlier plan to seek open-ended authorisation for punitive air strikes in response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons in a civilian massacre in eastern Damascus on 21 August. Instead, the Obama administration was working with a bipartisan group of eight senators to craft a new resolution that would set a deadline for Syrian co-operation with the UN on disarmament, and authorise the use of force if that deadline was broken.</p><p>The Senate suspended plans to vote on military authorisation after meeting with Obama to discuss the proposed Russian deal. The majority leader, Harry Reid, said \"it's important we do this well, not quickly\" but called on Syria to show that its offer to hand over chemical weapons to international observers was \"not a ploy\".</p><p>A fellow Democrat, Joe Manchin, who has opposed military action, said he was heartened by the meeting and said he would pursue a separate resolution giving the Syrians time to comply.</p><p>On Tuesday Human Rights Watch said evidence from the massacre of civilians in eastern Damascus last month strongly suggested the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attacks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/118725/\" title=\"\">The report</a> based its conclusions on testimony from witnesses and medical staff as well analysis of the armaments used, which HRW said were of a type used only by the Syrian military. The effect on the victims pointed to a nerve agent, \"most likely sarin\".</p><p>It said it was impossible so far to give an exact death toll, but noted that the estimate in just one district was over 700 and that Médecins Sans Frontières had reported that at least 3,600 people were treated for symptoms consistent with exposure to neurotoxins.</p>","headline":"Syria pledges to sign chemical weapons treaty and reveal scale of stockpile","trailText":"Assad government offers measure as Russia and western powers wrangle at UN over necessity of military threat","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/10/1378837654588/Vladimir-Putin-005.jpg","wordcount":"876","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"416982163","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8057490","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, Dan Roberts and Spencer Ackerman in Washington and Nicholas Watt","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-11T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1963400","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-13T18:32:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/russia-un-syrian-chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/10/russia-un-syrian-chemical-weapons","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

So what design should international policymakers pursue?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:11:01Z","body":"<p>There were many ironies to the lecture that Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html\" title=\"\">gave New York Times readers</a> on the need to uphold international law. Here was an assiduous supplier of Bashar al-Assad's war machine – just as effective a feeder of the collective furnace as Iran, Hezbollah, Libyan middle men, Saudi Arabia and Qatar – posing as peacebroker. But here too was the man who, only two weeks ago, was deemed so peripheral to US foreign policy goals that Barack Obama cancelled plans to hold a bilateral with him at St Petersburg. Russia's temporary emergence as the knight in shining armour holds one unsavoury truth to those in the White House, Downing Street and the Elysée who still believe in business as usual on the world stage: the failure of western diplomacy has handed the initiative to Russia. This is because, for such a long time, the aim of British, French and US foreign policy was not to seek a diplomatic solution to Syria, but to support the rebels in securing a military one.</p><p>It is difficult to resist the notion, however, that something more fundamental is taking place: that Syria, after the failures of interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, may not be <em>sui generis</em>. The twists and turns of policy raging in Mr Obama's own mind about a strike on Syria are the latest example of what the <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)</a> has dubbed the year of living tactically. The IISS defines the problem as more than a failure of leadership or will. It is the absence of strategy that worries it most. Crisis management has replaced the pursuit of grand designs. It puts much of the blame on Washington itself, which it says acts not just out of war-weariness, but from a judgment that most foreign-policy problems fall into the \"too hard\" category. Why stop there?</p><p>An example of British hubris was on display at an arms fair in Docklands this week when the first sea lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, claimed that two large new aircraft carriers being built for the navy would put Britain back on the world stage. The carriers would be nothing less than a symbol of national authority, he claimed. Putting to one side the difficulty he will have in finding planes to put on them, the words themselves hark back to a sepia-tinted vision of British naval power. They are perilously at odds with a world where the utility of force is not obvious. Does Britain conceive its role to be that of an international firefighter? In which case, it has engaged in interventions that have spread fires more than they have extinguished them. Is Britain an essential member of future military coalitions?</p><p>The two closest coalitions are in need of some repair in the dry dock. Nato's past purpose was clear, but its future one, after Afghanistan, is anything but. And the EU did not act in Mali – France did. Germany ducked Libya and resisted a strong statement at the G20 on Syria. François Hollande is drawing the wrong conclusions if he thinks Mali will form a reliable template for Syria. An alliance forged by a common will? It can work in specific areas, such as the anti-piracy campaign off the coast of Somalia. But where it matters most, on its doorstep in the Mediterranean, and in the Middle East, EU foreign policy is held together with duct tape.</p><p>What grand design should international policymakers be pursuing? Democracy promotion and state-building are debased currencies, after the experience of Afghanistan and Iraq. Responsibility to protect is following a similar trajectory in Syria. But the first-order question still remains unanswered. If indeed we are bidding farewell to a world where the only global policeman is no longer up to walking the beat, to whom does the task now fall? International law and order, and interventions, derive first and foremost from establishing their legitimacy and from answering the question: whose law and whose order? To do that we need a UN security council that represents the nations that do the bulk of international peacekeeping.

It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies.</p><p>Relations between us have passed through different stages. We stood against each other during the cold war. But we were also allies once, and defeated the Nazis together. The universal international organization – the United Nations – was then established to prevent such devastation from ever happening again.</p><p></p><p>The United Nations' founders understood that decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus, and with America's consent the veto by security council permanent members was enshrined in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml\" title=\"\">United Nations charter</a>. The profound wisdom of this has underpinned the stability of international relations for decades.</p><p></p><p>No one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations\" title=\"\">League of Nations</a>, which collapsed because it lacked real leverage. This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without security council authorisation.</p><p></p><p>The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders. A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism. It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilise the Middle East and North Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.</p><p></p><p>Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multireligious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough al-Qaida fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government. The United States State Department has designated al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, fighting with the opposition, as terrorist organisations. This internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition, is one of the bloodiest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Mercenaries from Arab countries fighting there, and hundreds of militants from western countries and even Russia, are an issue of our deep concern. Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria? After all, after fighting in Libya, extremists moved on to Mali. This threatens us all.</p><p></p><p>From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations security council and believe that preserving law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not. Under current international law, force is permitted only in self-defense or by the decision of the security council. Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations charter and would constitute an act of aggression.</p><p></p><p>No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack – this time <a href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/09/09/322987/syria-militants-ready-to-attack-israel/\" title=\"\">against Israel</a> – cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan \"you're either with us or against us\".</p><p></p><p>But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.</p><p></p><p>No matter how targeted the strikes or how sophisticated the weapons, civilian casualties are inevitable, including the elderly and children, whom the strikes are meant to protect.</p><p></p><p>The world reacts by asking: if you cannot count on international law, then you must find other ways to ensure your security. Thus a growing number of countries seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction. This is logical: if you have the bomb, no one will touch you. We are left with talk of the need to strengthen nonproliferation, when in reality this is being eroded.</p><p></p><p>We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.</p><p></p><p>A new opportunity to avoid military action has emerged in the past few days. The United States, Russia and all members of the international community must take advantage of the Syrian government's willingness to place its chemical arsenal under international control for subsequent destruction. Judging by the statements of President Obama, the United States sees this as an alternative to military action.</p><p></p><p>I welcome the president's interest in continuing the dialogue with Russia on Syria. We must work together to keep this hope alive, as we agreed to at the Group of 8 meeting in Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in June, and steer the discussion back toward negotiations.</p><p></p><p>If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust. It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues.</p><p></p><p>My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this. I carefully studied his <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-obama-syria-20130911,0,3505376.story\" title=\"\">address to the nation</a> on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is \"what makes America different. It's what makes us exceptional\". It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.</p>","headline":"A plea for caution from Russia","trailText":"<strong>Vladimir Putin: </strong>Recent events surrounding Syria have prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378984106035/Russian-President-Vladimi-003.jpg","wordcount":"1054","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417112521","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8064406","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Vladimir Putin","internalPageCode":"1964309","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T11:40:54Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/russia-putin-syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/russia-putin-syria","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without security council authorisation.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> we are not going to stand back and let Syria become another Iraq (when US-led military action was taken without UN authority). Putin implies that by its principled stance, Russia has become the chief defender of the UN system and international law. This is an extraordinary piece of hypocrisy, given that Russia has blocked effective UN action on Syria for two years and is bound, for example, like the US, to uphold the international chemical weapons convention.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> Putin raises the spectre of a wider Middle East conflagration without acknowledging that, if it happened, Russia's policy so far will have made this outcome more likely, and that Moscow would be deeply involved in any conflict through proxy forces and arms sales. This is real Orwellian double-speak.</p><p>But he delivers a powerful poke in the eye for Obama when he suggests US action in Syria could torpedo the Israel-Palestine peace process, which the US is trying to revive, and make it harder to resolve the impasse over Iran's nuclear programme.</p><p>That the man responsible for appalling past violence in Chechnya should summon the pope as an ally is extraordinary. And the idea that he really cares about \"innocent victims\" in Syria is sickening.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> on the day after the 9/11 anniversary, Putin suggests he knows better than Obama, the man who has effectively crushed the leadership of al-Qaida and killed Osama bin Laden, about the perils posed by jihadism. But he speaks for many in the west when he argues that mercenaries fighting in Syria, and armed by US allies, could one day move their operations to other countries, as happened in Libya-Mali, and most famously in Afghanistan-Pakistan. Reminding Obama how the US helped create the Taliban is a low blow.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack – this time against Israel – cannot be ignored.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> the claim that the rebels, not the government, have used chemical weapons to trick the US into intervening is not new, but by recycling it, Putin further muddies the waters. The reference to a possible CW attack on Israel is a masterstroke, given the sensitivity of the Democratic administration and its backers to all matters affecting the Jewish state.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you're either with us or against us'.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> another canny blow delivered to the American solar plexus. Putin is echoing many people in the US who oppose their country's activities as self-appointed global policeman and believe its values have been severely compromised in the post-9/11 years. By offering a resumed diplomatic dialogue as the way out of the Syrian morass, Putin is attempting to seize and hold the moral high ground and assert Russian leadership amid the evident confusion in Washington. If his initiative ultimately prevents US action, he expects to be seen as a hero in many parts of the world.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> this passage takes the biscuit for sheer chutzpah. Referring directly to Obama's depiction this week of America as an exceptional nation called to do great things in the world, Putin invokes God Almighty, democracy, and the American constitution in one breath to suggest Obama is a menace to global society. You can almost hear the cynical laughter in the Kremlin. It is hard to remember that Putin is the man, more than any other, who has made a mockery of democracy in Russia.</p>","headline":"What Vladimir Putin's address to Americans on Syria really means","trailText":"The Russian president's New York Times piece appears to offer friendship to Barack Obama while sticking the knife in","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378984375158/Putin-and-Obama-004.jpg","wordcount":"908","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417112337","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8064198","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Simon Tisdall","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1964307","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T11:16:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/vladimir-putin-americans-syria-means","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/vladimir-putin-americans-syria-means","tags":[{"id":"world/vladimir-putin","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/vladimir-putin","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

With the solemn grandeur appropriate to a declaration of war, president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/obama-diplomatic-path-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">Barack Obama informed the American people</a> on Tuesday night that a congressional vote on military action had been postponed because Russia was now brokering a diplomatic initiative that might, or might not, put Syria's chemical weapons under international control. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address\" title=\"\">Gettysburg address</a> this wasn't.</p><p>There will be many more turns on the road to Damascus, but the politics of these weeks since the criminal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">use of&nbsp;chemical weapons in Syria on 21&nbsp;August</a> already tell us a lot about the US. First and foremost, they tell us what&nbsp;Obama himself acknowledged in his televised address, quoting the words&nbsp;of a letter sent him by a veteran: \"This nation is sick and tired of war.\"</p><p>Yes, the shadow of being misled by Colin Powell (of all people) about the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-schwarz/colin-powell-wmd-iraq-war_b_2624620.html\" title=\"\">intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction</a> hangs over this debate, as over European debates. But that's not the main point for most Americans. According to a New York Times-CBS poll this week, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/world/middleeast/poll-majority-of-americans-oppose-military-strike.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">75% of Americans think the Syrian government \"probably did\" use chemical weapons</a> against Syrian civilians – and still they're overwhelmingly against the US military response that Obama advocated.</p><p>Every one of the countless members of Congress I've seen interviewed on cable television news has acknowledged this, be they Republican or Democrat, for or against striking Syria. Only \"three or four\" of at least a thousand constituents he's talked to favour military action, reports Congressman Elijah Cummings, a Democrat and Obama supporter. Senator Rand (son of&nbsp;Ron) Paul, a rising star of the Republican&nbsp;party, says his phone calls are \"100 to 1\" against war.</p><p>The American people are \"sick and tired\" of it. They don't think it's done any good in the Middle East. It's cost trillions of dollars, while they've been losing their jobs and homes, struggling to get by, seeing their own roads, hospitals and schools decay. Now here's the great irony: this is Obama's own theme tune. He's the president who came into office to end \"a decade of war\" (a trademark phrase he used again in this speech) and concentrate on \"nation-building at home\". So the popular sentiment is one he both&nbsp;reflected and reinforced.</p><p>And – irony upon irony – if Obama's own best enemy, Russian president Vladimir Putin, had not self-interestedly ridden to the rescue at the eleventh hour, that very sentiment would probably have delivered a shattering blow to the American presidency. For&nbsp;when we woke up on Monday morning, it looked as if he faced defeat in a vote in&nbsp;the House of Representatives, if not in the Senate.</p><p>\"Isolationism\" is the lazy term often applied to the attitude now found among Democrats and Republicans alike. It is true that the US has a history of periodically withdrawing into its own vast continental indifference, as it did after the first world war. But this time feels different. While the current withdrawalism undoubtedly drinks from some of those traditional wells, it flows through a country not brashly rising on the world stage but fearfully conscious of relative decline. Back in the 1920s, Americans were not worried&nbsp;about a rising China eating their&nbsp;lunch – and then buying the hamburger stall. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/05/usa-china-smithfield-idUSL4N0H10G720130905\" title=\"\">They are now</a>.</p><p>A few more specific ingredients of this American pie also deserve mention. One is Israel. It is hard to overstate the impact of concerns about Israel on American foreign policy in general, and its Middle East policy in particular.</p><p>Some of the most chilling analysis I have read over these weeks identifies an Israeli realpolitik which concludes that the least worst outcome for Israel is that two sets of its arch-enemies – the Iran and Hezbollah-backed Assad regime and the increasingly Sunni Islamist extremist and partly al-Qaida oriented rebels – should go on beating the living daylights out of each other.</p><p>\"Our 'best case scenario' is that they continue to busy themselves fighting each other and don't turn their attention to us,\" <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/the-horrifying-secret-of-syria-policy\" title=\"\">an unnamed Israeli intelligence officer tells a writer on buzzfeed.com</a>. \"Let them both bleed, haemorrhage to death: that's the strategic thinking here,\" says Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. This makes Machiavelli look like Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>Then there are the interventionist hawks, such as John McCain and Paul Wolfowitz, who believe the US should act more decisively so as to enable more moderate rebels to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. They'll be very unhappy with a fix that may only contain the chemical weapons, and that only by making a Russian-brokered deal with Assad. Beside them are Republican politicos so incurably partisan that doing down Obama takes precedence over stopping Assad. And there are the seasoned strategic types – quite a lot of them, actually, not least in or connected to the American military – who carefully think through all the implications for&nbsp;the US and the region. Overwhelmingly, their message is caution.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least, there are still a few liberal, humanitarian interventionists, of the old 1990s genre, shaped by the experiences of Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo. Obama has appointed as his ambassador to the UN an almost totemic representative of that persuasion, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Power\" title=\"\">Samantha Power</a>, the author of a 2002 book called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Problem_from_Hell\" title=\"\">A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide</a>. Well, Syria is a problem from hell, all right. These liberal humanitarian interventionists are not the predominant voice in an administration characterised by cautious, security-first pragmatism, but they're still there.</p><p>I am writing this column on the 12th anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attacks which launched the US into that decade of war – justifiably, in the immediate response to al-Qaida in Afghanistan, unjustifiably and disastrously in Iraq. This is a very different America now.</p><p>Maybe after some years spent putting its own house in order it will come back as the – for all its many faults and hypocrisies – indispensable anchor of some kind of liberal international order. Yet given not just its structural domestic problems but above all the changing global power constellation around it, I doubt it. To the many critics and downright enemies of the US in Europe and across the globe, I say only this: if you didn't like that old world in which the US regularly intervened, just see how you like the new one in which it does not.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p>","headline":"This crisis resolves little in Syria but says a lot about the United States","trailText":"<strong>Timothy Garton Ash:</strong> The nation is sick and tired of foreign wars, and may never play its role of&nbsp;global anchor again.

a path worth exploring","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-10T22:05:10Z","sectionName":"Comment is free","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/10/syria-a-path-worth-exploring","fields":{"standfirst":"For the first time in two and a half years, everyone in the Syrian crisis – except the rebels – appears to be on the same page","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:01:10Z","body":"<p>However the plan emerged – whether it was the US secretary of state John Kerry going off-piste at a press conference, whether it had been floated at the G20 summit last week, or whether it had been worked over <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3863062.ece\" title=\"\">in back-channel discussions </a>for some time – it soon acquired momentum. Within 24 hours, China and Iran had backed the emerging Russia-US idea for Syria to surrender its chemical arsenal – although Iran added that this should include the chemical weapons it alleged were in rebel hands. Barack Obama, increasingly uncertain of winning congressional backing for a strike over Syria's alleged chemical weapons use, put that idea on hold and said the plan for Syria to sign the chemical weapons convention (CWC) could be a significant breakthrough. For the first time in two and a half years, everyone in the Syrian crisis – except the rebels – appears to be on the same page.</p><p>This is welcome, although that momentum was already slowing over the insistence by the US, UK and France to make a UN resolution enforceable with military action. Vladimir Putin said that a draft resolution could only work if the use of force was off the table. As the CWC process contains its own timetable and enforcement procedures, there must still be room for compromise although the meeting at the UN was postponed. The international securing of Syria's chemical weapons should be explored, however, not least because it may simultaneously stop a military strike and chart a way back to the negotiating table at Geneva. If successful, Syria's putative agreement to admit inspectors to verify and seal its chemical weapons stockpile could be accompanied by a wider ceasefire negotiated in Geneva. One agreement could lead to another.</p><p>This is emphatically not the case with a military strike. The closer Mr Obama comes to pulling the trigger, the more difficulty his advisers and spokesmen have in defining the mission. Is it an \"unbelievably small, limited kind of effort\" (Mr Kerry) or does \"The US … not do pinpricks\" (Mr Obama)? Are the strikes intended to tip the balance of power or just as a shot across the bows? The original project of arming the rebels, proposed by Hillary Clinton and David Petraeus, then secretary of state and head of the CIA, had one purpose in mind – regime change. The military option morphed, in British and French hands, into a plan to force Bashar al-Assad to the negotiating table by securing rebel gains on the ground.</p><p>Yet, as the war drags on, an Assad defeat looksincreasingly unlikely. His forces are cohesive and their lines of supply from Russia and Iran not in doubt. The rebels' forces are anything but unified. They have been Balkanised along ethnic, religious and local lines, and follow competing military strategies. Some jihadi groups are now using Syria as a base to attack Iraq.</p><p>We could swiftly reach the point, if we have not got there already, where it is not in international interests for any side to win.</p><p>If the twists and turns of the Lebanese civil war become a template for the Syrian one, peace would be a long way down the line. And if and when it came, it might not deliver a country liberated from a single dictator. Rather, it might produce a landscape dominated by lots of them, each in control of his own patch. The sooner the fighting stops, the greater the chances of stopping such Balkanisation.The diplomatic option has real advantages. The first steps are clear – Mr Assad's signature on an agreement to join the CWC – and could even be achieved almost as quickly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24038120\" title=\"\">as Mr Kerry is urging</a>. The next steps are more difficult, but they are automatic and intrusive. Thirty days after signing, any use or stockpiling of chemical agents would be illegal and make Syria liable to emergency inspections. The practical problems of delivering this, in the midst of a civil war, should not be underestimated.</p><p>But for now, the problem and doubts over enforcement should not be allowed to obscure the ultimate goal – that if Syria signs the CWC, and it said  it would, a procedure will be put in place that is more thorough and more targeted at Syria's chemical weapons stock than any military action, barring full  scale invasion, could achieve.</p><p>If the CWC route takes time, so be it. Renouncing the use of force – that Mr Obama's administration is deeply divided about  and struggling to define –may be the price that has to be paid.</p>","headline":"Syria: a path worth exploring","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> For the first time in two and a half years, everyone in the Syrian crisis – except the rebels – appears to be on the same page","newspaperPageNumber":"34","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3tk9b","wordcount":"751","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"416993921","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8055051","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-11T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1963451","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-13T22:05:10Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/10/syria-a-path-worth-exploring","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/10/syria-a-path-worth-exploring","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

It was the scoop of the century. For his lone, perilous journey that defied the US occupation authorities, Burchett was pilloried, not least by his embedded colleagues. He warned that an act of premeditated mass murder on an epic scale had launched a new era of terror.</p><p>Almost every day now, he is vindicated. The intrinsic criminality of the atomic bombing is borne out in the US National Archives and by the subsequent decades of militarism camouflaged as democracy. The Syria psychodrama exemplifies this. Yet again we are held hostage by the prospect of a terrorism whose nature and history even the most liberal critics still deny. The great unmentionable is that humanity's most dangerous enemy resides across the Atlantic.</p><p>John Kerry's farce and Barack Obama's pirouettes are temporary. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/us-russian-proposal-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">Russia's peace deal over chemical weapons</a> will, in time, be treated with the contempt that all militarists reserve for diplomacy. With al-Qaida now among its allies, and US-armed coupmasters secure in Cairo, the US intends to crush the last independent states in the Middle East: Syria first, then Iran. \"This operation [in Syria],\" said the former French foreign minister Roland Dumas in June, \"goes way back. <a href=\"http://explosivereports.com/2013/07/07/former-french-foreign-minister-anglo-french-operations-against-assad-prepared-preconceived-and-planned/\" title=\"\">It was prepared, pre-conceived and planned</a>.\"</p><p>When the public is \"psychologically scarred\", as the Channel 4 reporter Jonathan Rugman described the British people's overwhelming hostility to an attack on Syria, suppressing the truth is made urgent. Whether or not Bashar al-Assad or the \"rebels\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\" title=\"\">used gas in the suburbs of Damascus</a>, it is the US, not Syria, that is the world's most prolific user of these terrible weapons.</p><p>In 1970 the Senate reported: \"The US has dumped on Vietnam a quantity of toxic chemical (dioxin) amounting to six pounds per head of population.\" This was <a href=\"http://starabcd.blogspot.co.uk/2007/07/operation-hades-later-known-as.html\" title=\"\">Operation Hades, later renamed the friendlier Operation Ranch Hand</a> – the source of what Vietnamese doctors call a \"cycle of foetal catastrophe\". I have seen generations of children with their familiar, monstrous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3798581.stm\" title=\"\">deformities</a>. John Kerry, with his own blood-soaked <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_career_of_John_Kerry\" title=\"\">war record</a>, will remember them. I have seen them in Iraq too, where the US used depleted uranium and white phosphorus, as did the Israelis in Gaza. No Obama \"red line\" for them. No showdown psychodrama for them.</p><p>The sterile repetitive debate about whether \"we\" should \"take action\" against selected dictators (ie cheer on the US and its acolytes in yet another aerial killing spree) is part of our brainwashing. Richard Falk, professor emeritus of international law and UN special rapporteur on Palestine, describes it as \"a self-righteous, one-way, legal/moral screen [with] positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened, validating a campaign of unrestricted political violence\". This \"is so widely accepted as to be virtually unchallengeable\".</p><p>It is the biggest lie: the product of \"liberal realists\" in Anglo-American politics, scholarship and media who ordain themselves as the world's crisis managers, rather than the cause of a crisis. Stripping humanity from the study of nations and congealing it with jargon that serves western power designs, they mark \"failed\", \"rogue\" or \"evil\" states for \"humanitarian intervention\".</p><p>An attack on Syria or Iran or any other US \"demon\" would draw on a fashionable variant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/04/un-syria-duty-to-intervene\" title=\"\">\"Responsibility to Protect\", or R2P</a> – whose lectern-trotting zealot is the former Australian foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.gevans.org/biography.html\" title=\"\">Gareth Evans</a>, co-chair of a \"<a href=\"http://www.globalr2p.org/\" title=\"\">global centre</a>\" based in New York. Evans and his generously funded lobbyists play a vital propaganda role in urging the \"international community\" to attack countries where \"the security council rejects a proposal or fails to deal with it in a reasonable time\".</p><p>Evans has form. He appeared in my 1994 film <a href=\"http://johnpilger.com/videos/death-of-a-nation-the-timor-conspiracy\" title=\"\">Death of a Nation</a>, which revealed the scale of genocide in East Timor. Canberra's smiling man is raising his champagne glass in a toast to his Indonesian equivalent as they fly over East Timor in an Australian aircraft, having signed a treaty to pirate the oil and gas of the stricken country where the tyrant Suharto killed or starved a third of the population.</p><p>Under the \"weak\" Obama, militarism has risen perhaps as never before. With not a single tank on the White House lawn, a military coup has taken place in Washington. In 2008, while his liberal devotees dried their eyes, Obama accepted the entire Pentagon of his predecessor, George Bush: its wars and war crimes. As the constitution is replaced by an emerging police state, those who destroyed Iraq with shock and awe, piled up the rubble in Afghanistan and reduced Libya to a Hobbesian nightmare, are ascendant across the US administration. Behind their beribboned facade, more former US soldiers are killing themselves than are dying on battlefields. Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/01/us-military-suicide-epidemic-veteran\" title=\"\">6,500 veterans took their own lives</a>. Put out more flags.</p><p>The historian Norman Pollack calls this \"liberal fascism\": \"For goose-steppers substitute the seemingly more innocuous militarisation of the total culture. And for the bombastic leader, we have the reformer manqué, blithely at work, planning and executing assassination, smiling all the while.\" Every Tuesday the \"humanitarian\" Obama personally oversees a worldwide terror network of drones that \"bugsplat\" people, their rescuers and mourners. In the west's comfort zones, the first black leader of the land of slavery still feels good, as if his very existence represents a social advance, regardless of his trail of blood. This obeisance to a symbol has all but destroyed the US anti-war movement – Obama's singular achievement.</p><p>In Britain, the distractions of the fakery of image and identity politics have not quite succeeded. A stirring has begun, though people of conscience should hurry.
