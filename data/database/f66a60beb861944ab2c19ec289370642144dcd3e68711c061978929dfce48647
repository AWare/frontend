Is the capital's rash of new skyscrapers the result of lazy, unimaginative designs waved through by council planners for political and commercial gain? Or do high buildings bring a sense of ambition to a city's idea of itself &ndash; and provide desperately needed space on the vertical plane? The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We'd like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings &shy;&ndash; the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are.

They prove that big doesn't necessarily mean bad, and that not every tower has to be an icon, topped with a jaunty profile or dressed in a jazzy outfit to succeed. After calling out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/29/top-10-worst-london-skyscrapers-quill-odalisk-walkie-talkie\">10 of the worst offenders</a> last week, here's our run-down of the top 10 model performers, in the hope that some lessons might be learned from their success.</p><h2>10. Natwest Tower</h2><p>Location: City of London | Floors: 47 | Height: 183m | Architect: Richard Seifert | Status: Completed 1980 | Use: Office</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cbcdb056-c714-46a1-b1fe-b36252db7d35\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399222594637/c6d9f624-f7d2-4642-b9a4-9f73d52d1f99-338x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Natwest Tower\" width=\"338\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: David Levene</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dressed in sleek silvery pin-stripes, the Natwest Tower (now Tower 42) stands with an air of suave simplicity compared to some of the more recent arrivals to the City. After a 10-year saga of construction, costing the equivalent of £230m to build in today's money, it was the tallest building in the country for a decade after completion, and the tallest building in the City for more than 30 years, until it was overtaken by the Heron Tower in 2009. Designed to resemble the Natwest logo from above, it is formed from three interlocking chevrons, extruded into a staggered cluster, with the shallow office floor-plates cantilevered out from a central concrete core. A high-tech wonder, it featured the UK's first double-decker lifts, as well as a “mail train” for distributing documents around the building.</p><h2>9.  Economist Plaza</h2><p>Location: St James's | Floors: 16 | Height: 53m | Architect: Alison &amp; Peter Smithson | Status: Completed, 1964. Grade II* listed | Use: Office &amp; residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8839bf36-09d6-4c0b-ae74-7ce78c66d792\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399222470052/5425862805_3ac1bb96b6_o-350x420.jpeg\" alt=\"economist plaza\" width=\"350\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/5425862805/\">Photograph: /flickr</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>An essay in how tall buildings can be successfully knitted into London's streets and provide a decent civic space at ground level, the Economist Plaza is the work of arch-Brutalists Alison and Peter Smithson, architects of the doomed <a href=\"http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/robin-hood-gardens/\">Robin Hood Gardens estate</a> in east London. While that faces the wrecking ball, the Economist complex is regarded as their masterpiece, “one of the most successful examples of urban design to be seen anywhere,” according to American architectural historian Vincent Scully, who said it was “among the most important buildings of the decade.” Framed by carefully proportioned elevations, the central square is described by English Heritage as “one of London's most memorable modern spaces, offering subtle intimations of the Greek agora, the Italian piazza and the alleys and courts of Georgian London.”<br></p><h2>8. Mansion House Square</h2><p>Location: Poultry | Floors: 20 | Height: 88m |<br>Architect: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe | Status: Proposed, 1969. Unbuilt | Use: Office</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b44b880-d2fc-4cd1-94f9-b2df2751b5bc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399222327558/cd25b469-3e36-411c-94ac-bdd45c05aef4-460x354.png\" alt=\"Mies Mansion House\" width=\"460\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Image: <a href=\"http://www.ribajournal.com/pages/march13_critique__ghost_of_mies_at_mansion_house_205711.cfm\">RIBA Journal</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where the cartoon cruise-liner of James Stirling's <a href=\"http://www.londonarchitectureblog.com/2013/10/week-39-13-feature-32-no1-poultry.html\">No 1 Poultry</a> now stands, jutting its cheeky prow towards the Bank of England, might instead have risen the slick bronzed slab of Mies van der Rohe's only project in the UK – if Prince Charles and his chums hadn't had their way. After a 25-year campaign to see it built by developer Peter Palumbo, an ardent collector of modernist houses, the scheme was turned  down at public inquiry in 1985. Labelled “a glass stump better suited to downtown Chicago” by the Prince, who was an old polo team mate of the Palumbo's, the tower would have been an intelligent use of the site, freeing up space at street level for a new public square. Imagined as a place for festivals and exhibitions, this piazza would have been framed by the grand facades of the surrounding buildings, opening up views of Mansion House, Lutyens' Midland Bank and the Wren church of St Stephen Walbrook.</p><h2>7. South Quay Plaza</h2><p>Location: Canary Wharf | Floors: 36 &amp; 73 | Height: 250m | Architect: Norman Foster | Status: Proposed | Use: Residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3baf069e-1e62-4e5e-967e-dde5d14b1a9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399222010481/2e819d3a-dfc4-4004-b1f7-e04533dbc242-302x420.jpeg\" alt=\"South Quay Plaza\" width=\"302\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Image: Foster &amp; Partners/Berkeley Homes</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like two proud sentinels rising above the surrounding din, Foster's “toothpick towers” are a model of refinement. The tallest residential buildings in the country, they will contain 900 flats sprouting out of a 1.5 acre public park. Designed as two squares in plan, interlocking at their corners where the circulation core is housed, the towers' glass facades are each split in two, giving the impression of a conjoined cluster of six impossibly slender shafts. The project echoes Foster's design for <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/610-lexington-avenue/\">610 Lexington Avenue</a> in New York, which joins a growing number of sleek pencil towers rising across the city. London's tall buildings would do well to learn from  Manhattan, a skyline that has been driven by strict regulations and an understanding that not every tower needs to shout.</p><h2>6. Trellick Tower</h2><p>Location: Ladbroke Grove | Floors: 31 | Height: 98m | Architect: Erno Goldfinger | Status: Completed 1972. Grade II* listed | Use: Residential </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3b2c2084-cd95-4319-ae77-d5754f97b5f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221899688/518138fc-69b1-4f20-8693-e885d2321045-333x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Trellick Tower\" width=\"333\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Trellick Tower Photograph: VIEW Pictures Ltd/Alamy</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A pixelated cliff-face of bush-hammered concrete soaring above the prim terraced streets of Notting Hill, Trellick Tower has become a west London icon, reproduced on cushions and bags, its brute force transposed into comforting kitsch. Designed by Hungarian-born emigre Ernö Goldfinger as social housing for the Greater London Council, its 200 flats are cleverly arranged in stacked streets, connected by sky-bridges to a freestanding circulation core. Based on his earlier design for the <a href=\"http://www.c20society.org.uk/botm/balfron-tower/\">Balfron Tower</a> in Poplar, the slim service tower is punctuated by thin arrow-slit windows and topped with a glass boiler-house, giving the complex a medieval sci-fi look.</p><h2> 5. One Wood Wharf</h2><p>Location: Canary Wharf | Floors: 55 | Height: 154m | Architect: Herzog &amp; de Meuron | Status: Proposed | Use: Residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e9dba531-b729-4cf0-8654-28b322b19af3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221811318/734b2b7e-9d54-437c-931b-c642c27fa3fc-287x420.jpeg\" alt=\"One Wood Wharf\" width=\"287\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Image: Herzog &amp; de Meuron</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like a knobbly stick of white coral poking out from the Canary Wharf's thicket of glass slabs, One Wood Wharf will be an original new residential addition to the financial centre by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, creators of Tate Modern. Pixelated like a cylindrical stack of sugar cubes, the building expresses the individual apartments within the overall complex, the units shuffled in and out of the facade to create balconies and terraces of varying sizes. The different apartment types are layered in groups, creating a series of vertical neighbourhoods, each offset to form a spiral of big bay windows up the facade.</p><h2>4. Barbican Estate</h2><p>Location: City of London | Floors: 42 | Height: 123m | Architect: Chamberlin, Powell &amp; Bon | Status: Completed 1969. Grade II listed | Use: Residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8828a5c7-c8e9-4832-acdc-9ddc08069a5d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221682477/6e1c23a8-ed13-4ef4-9cf2-f8273c132aef-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Towers of flats at the Barbican Centre, London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Towers of flats at the Barbican Centre, London. Photograph: David Levene</figcaption> </figure>  <p>With their serrated balconies sawing at the clouds, the Barbican towers cast an imposing presence on the skyline, bringing a dash of Blade Runner excitement to the City fringe. Conceived as a brave new Belgravia, to bring the professional classes back to the middle of the City, the Barbican rose from the rubble of a blitz bomb-site as a self-contained walled city, a 40-acre vertical paradise of housing, offices, shops and schools, all floating above a cavernous plinth of cultural facilities. Declared “one of the wonders of the modern world” by the Queen, when she finally opened it in 1982, it has since gone on to top the polls of London's most reviled buildings – despite its panoramic flats swapping hands for many millions.</p><h2>3. Centre Point</h2><p>Location: Tottenham Court Road | Floors: 33 |<br>Height: 117m | Architect: Richard Seifert |<br>Status: Completed 1967. Grade II listed | Use: Office &amp; residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-33c509ae-10e5-4991-936c-5b43919d564c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221333314/0c13d336-63c2-45b2-9afd-eaeb579946e7-281x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Centre Point\" width=\"281\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Headline photo agency</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A sparkling white beacon at the crossroads of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, Centre Point's slender profile and sharply sculpted facade is a refreshing antidote to the acres of curtain-wall glass stretched across fattened slabs that have popped up around the city since it was built. With  bold op-art patterning and finely tailored lines of a Mary Quant dress, it embodied the spirit of 60s London – as Building magazine commented at the time, “more than any other building Centre Point made the city swing”. But it was not to everyone's taste. Nikolaus Pevsner described it as “coarse in the extreme,” while John Betjeman referred to its “flashy and international style of crystalline concrete.” For years it stood empty, seen as a brash monument to the greed of its developer, property tycoon Harry Hyams.</p><h2>2. The Shard</h2><p>Location: London Bridge | Floors: 72 | Height: 300m | Architect: Renzo Piano | Status: Completed 2012 | Use: Office, hotel, residential</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6fcbd66e-9821-44c6-84e1-a88a3104bce6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221102152/33e6d4c4-52a8-4070-bbcb-bd4a53fa96b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Shard\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Shard is an unearthly sight on the south London horizon, a fractured crystalline spear like something hurtled  from planet Krypton. At times a leaden pyramid, at others a gleaming spire, it is a beguiling barometer of the city's changeable weather – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ollywainwright/status/461423074668478464\">recently dissolving into a holographic apparition in the sun-lit fog</a>. Loved and loathed in equal measure, it is an apt symbol of the city's accidental planning system, the result of a plucky gamble by a man who had never built anything taller than industrial sheds in Portsmouth and Warrington. Bailed out by Qatar, the building has stood mostly empty since completion. For all its grace on the horizon, it is clumsy where it meets the ground, turning its back on the street in a jumble of canopies and blank walls.</p><h2> 1. The Gherkin</h2><p>Location: St Mary Axe | Floors: 41 | Height: 180m | Architect: Norman Foster | Status: Completed 2003 | Use: Office</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0c55bc6e-9557-4636-a1f7-162617a8ddfd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399221009738/7df1c82c-2c2c-4a2b-b89d-ac2e95551a8a-273x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Gherkin\" width=\"273\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: David Levene</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also likened to a pine cone, a bullet and a stubby cigar – and perhaps least like its knobbly pickled namesake – the Gherkin was a mischievous arrival to the City skyline in 2003. A lovable, chubby creature, it has stood the test of time, holding its own in an increasingly choked cluster. Wrapped with a diagrid structure that makes it look like it's bulging out of a pair of fishnet stockings, its rounded form was justified for reasons of aerodynamics (might it lift off?) and internal ventilation.

With an iron fist and an all-consuming passion, Graham ruled one of the most influential architectural practices of the late 20th century from Chicago, the city that synthesises the visual energy, technical inventiveness and economic clout of 20th-century modernism in&nbsp;architecture.</p><p>Graham's designs for SOM, which at their best possess these special qualities, mark the skylines of Chicago and London, but also Barcelona, Hong Kong and many other US cities. In Chicago, the city of skyscrapers, he authored its two most canonical structures – the delicately stacked volumes of the Sears Tower (for 24 years the world's tallest building, recently renamed the Willis Tower) and the tapering black Hancock Tower, with its distinctive criss-cross bracing disappearing into the Illinois sky.</p><p>In London, he gave shape to large parts of the 1980s building boom, designing nine buildings and the masterplan for the Broadgate office complex at Liverpool Street station and the Ludgate development near St&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral (for Stuart Lipton's development company, Rosehaugh Stanhope), as well as the initial plans for the Canary Wharf financial district in London's Docklands and the beautifully landscaped Stockley Park, near Heathrow. Outside London, he designed the restrained and elegant headquarters for Wills Tobacco (1971) in Bristol and the Boots Pure Drug Company headquarters, Nottingham (1968), both collaborations between SOM and the British architectural practice YRM.</p><p>Quick-witted, curious and always alert, Graham seemed to capture the spirit of the age from the mid-1970s to the 1990s. In a sense, he reinvented the role of the architect, recognising that the job is just as much about city-making and power-broking as it is about pure design talent, which Graham possessed in spades. His London client Lipton is adamant that Graham's understanding of how buildings are put together, how structure and form are integrated, and how any design must respond to its social context, changed the way commercial buildings have been made in the UK from the 1980s on.</p><p>Born in La Cumbre, Colombia, to a Peruvian mother and a Scottish banker father, Graham was brought up in Puerto Rico. As a child, he dreamed of&nbsp;building cities. As a teenager, he took pleasure in mapping the local slums, showing an early interest in the social and spatial politics of city life. He was educated in the US as an engineer and an architect and then joined the US navy during the second world war. \"I thought I had landed in a dream,\" he noted in an interview in 1997, when reminiscing about his first impressions of Chicago and the midwest, where he saw his first building more than 10 storeys high. Two&nbsp;decades later, he was responsible for designing the tallest and third tallest buildings in the world.</p><p>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Graham moved to Chicago and developed a fast-track career within SOM – one of the world's largest architectural practices – becoming a general partner in 1960 and leading the firm during the next two decades. In these early days, he forged links with Mies van der Rohe and other European modernist architects who had fled Nazi Germany, and was hugely influenced by their sparse, minimalist and technologically advanced design ethic.</p><p>But Graham never saw his projects at SOM as single pieces. They were part of a continuum of collaboration and experimentation that spanned his whole career, relying on the input from his trusted engineer Fazlur Khan (\"the best in the world, who understood mathematics and architecture\") and his fellow, equally talented design partners at SOM, such as Gordon Bunshaft and Myron Goldsmith.</p><p>From the inspired, minimalist designs for the Inland Steel building (1958) in Chicago (still regarded as one of the finest postwar US buildings) to the exposed structural arches of Exchange House (1990) that effortlessly span 80 metres above the railway tracks leading to Liverpool Street station in London, Graham's buildings reveal a desire to push forward the boundaries of experimentation in construction, technology and architectural expression. His design philosophy reflected a lifelong interest in collaboration – with engineers, artists, landscape designers, developers, clients and other architects – emphasising his belief that buildings do not stand alone, but always belong to a context.</p><p>But those of us who worked alongside Graham, as I did as an adviser to SOM and the Chicago Institute for Architecture and Urbanism in the late 1980s, recognised a generosity of spirit behind the aggressive \"city-builder\" who inherited the traditions and methods of Daniel Burnham, the great urban visionary who created the 1901 Plan of Chicago. Graham became chairman of the Chicago Central Area Plan in 1980 and worked closely with Mayor Richard Daley (father of the current incumbent) and Chicago's business community to bring about change at the heart of the city he loved.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-360861651'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/22/1256217551247/The-Willis-Tower-formerly-007.jpg' alt='The Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, in Chicago.

Photograph: Paul Owen</figcaption></figure><p>Graham was deeply critical of the negative impact of mid-20th-century planning, which devastated urban communities with the construction of freeways, the expansion of the suburbs and the emptying of city centres. His vision with the Chicago Central Area Plan was to reverse this trend, creating new downtown residential neighbourhoods, often bucking the market with radical ideas – such as the construction of the Hancock Tower in a fringe location – which brought investment to neglected areas of the city. Today, Chicago is seen as a US metropolitan success story, with more people moving back into the centre, as Graham had envisaged decades ago.</p><p>Graham possessed the raw intellect of a streetfighter, rather than the polished mannerisms of a design professional. He enjoyed spending time with mayors, developers and corporate clients, but was scornful of elitism. He often spoke frankly and harshly. Frank Lloyd Wright, the doyen of American architecture, was, in Graham's mind, \"a mean old man\". Many architects were simply \"stupid\". But he was equally generous with those he admired and went out of&nbsp;his way to help them, especially his old friend Frank Gehry.</p><p>Behind the hot-headed, hard-speaking facade was a softer, psychologically astute and socially engaged individual who cared passionately about the world. He had strong opinions on politics and delighted at the demise of imperialism, as he saw it. Dedicated to his family, he referred to his Austrian wife Jane, a distinguished interior architect, as his \"No 1 critic\". Graham's softer personality came out regularly. He often spoke Spanish, hugging a glass of&nbsp;whiskey among colleagues, grimacing or giggling at the stories of common friends and enemies.

Chinese cities have raced to the top, vying with each other to build the tallest and shiniest skyscrapers. Hangzhou is going in a radically different direction - down. It plans to lop floors off exclusive hotels, a television tower and other lakeside buildings in an attempt to win coveted Unesco world heritage status.</p><p>The 2,000-year-old city in Zhejiang, east China, is famed as one of the country's most beautiful. But urban development has blighted its scenery, leading officials to prune some of the latest additions to its landscape. </p><p>China applied 12 years ago for the area around West Lake to be named as a heritage site to boost tourism. It is often packed with domestic visitors at peak season, but is less well-known to foreign travellers. Unesco requires historic sites to be kept intact, and the 40m yuan (&pound;4m) resizing plan is the latest element in Hangzhou's attempts to beautify the site. </p><p>The China Daily newspaper said all buildings more than 24 metres (79ft) tall on the lake's eastern shore would be shortened. A notice posted on the city government's website said it would require taking floors off lakeside complexes, including the seven-storey east wing of the Shangri-La hotel, where suites cost thousands of pounds a night. </p><p>Wang Shuifa, who will head the redevelopment project, told the official China News Service news agency: \"We have hired foreign firms to draft detailed plans of how to reduce the height of the Shangri-La, whose owners will be compensated.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the 382-room hotel told Associated Press: \"We haven't received any order or notice about it. We're also very concerned and will pay close attention to this.\" Other structures named in the notice include the Huabei hotel and a television tower.</p><p>Hangzhou is fabled throughout China for its beauty. One saying observes that in the heavens there is paradise, while on earth there are Suzhou and Hangzhou. Another urges people to be \"born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou and die in Liuzhou\".  </p><p>Wang Chuanyue, a professor of architecture at Peking University, said increasingly numerous tall buildings were making the lake look smaller, detracting from its beauty. Planners also intend to remove some smaller commercial buildings around the lake.</p><p>Only Italy and Spain boast more world heritage sites than China. It has 37, including the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.</p>","headline":"Chinese city to trim tall buildings","trailText":"<p>Leading officials to prune urban development in Hangzhou, 2,000-year-old city in Zhejiang</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"33","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/12/12/84hang.jpg","wordcount":"388","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"340640988","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tania Branigan in Beijing","newspaperEditionDate":"2008-12-12T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1132886","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2008-12-15T00:13:41Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/12/hangzhou-urban-development-china","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/dec/12/hangzhou-urban-development-china","tags":[{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/china","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/architecture","webTitle":"Architecture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/architecture","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/taniabranigan","webTitle":"Tania Branigan","rcsId":"GNL004773","r2ContributorId":"16507","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/tania_branigan_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tania Branigan is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China correspondent</a> for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/taniabranigan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/taniabranigan","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-340653355","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/12/12/460hang.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Alamy","altText":"Hangzhou","height":"276","credit":"Alamy","caption":"Hangzhou.

It is routine for me to spot it from afar in Deepest Hackney, to feel it somehow drawing me down Whitechapel High Street and to catch glimpses of it from the top decks of number 48 buses as they inch along Bishopsgate, but I had never tracked it to its root in a little City street called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe\">St Mary's Axe</a>. It was a bit like finding the end of a rainbow, though I mustn't become drunk on metaphor. Let's appreciate the Gherkin for what it is: a veined and alluring symbol of potency and, oh, so very large. Just thinking about it makes me gasp.</p><p>Where was I? Oh yes. The Gherkin, of course, is the new tall building in London that those opposed to tall buildings in London keep quiet about. In the few years since it spiralled from the rubble of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/24/newsid_2523000/2523345.stm\">bombed Baltic Exchange</a>, it has become as integral to the capital's architectural iconography as Tower Bridge, Big Ben and St Paul's. To bad-mouth Norman Foster and Ken Shuttleworth's glass erection is to be fogey-ish beyond the point of profitable self-parody. Even Boris Johnson claims to like it. I rest my case.</p><p>The Gherkin, though, is the exception that proves the rule and, speaking of London's mayor, his readiness, or lack of it, to curb the proliferation of new-fangled towers in the capital is seen by traditionalists and critics of developers alike as a major test of his resolve. </p><p>English Heritage chairman, Simon Jenkins has <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23485703-details/The+towers+that+Boris+could+stop+being+built/article.do\">lambasted</a> The Blond for not flattening plans for a 43-storey block of posh flats behind the National Theatre. The mayor's office protests that challenging these would have meant challenging the government, which has already endorsed the plans, to no guaranteed effect at a public cost inconsistent with the mayor's wider cost-cutting agenda. But it still didn't look too clever from a man who'd told voters, \"I believe well-designed tall buildings should play a part in London's development, but they must not overshadow existing landmarks.\" </p><p>What would Boris do in other cases, when he is able to order a halt to such projects at an earlier, easier stage? What did he mean by \"well-designed\"? How would \"the development of London\" be defined? The credit crunch has stunted, at least for now, a number of high piles-in-progress, but not all. And Boris has now shown he'll sometimes conquer his reluctance to intervene in the affairs of London's boroughs. </p><p>In February he <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3134814\">let Tory Wandsworth know</a> he was \"very unhappy\" with a 250 metre high \"eco chimney\" that, as a result, Rafael Vinoly now no longer has in mind for rejuvenating Battersea Power Station. Yesterday he used his formal powers to <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2009/20090513/queens-market-stage2.pdf\">direct Labour Newham (pdf)</a> to refuse regeneration specialists St Modwen permission to proceed with the controversial <a href=\"http://www.newham.gov.uk/Services/RegenerationProjects/AboutUs/queensmarket.htm\">destruction and rebuilding of Queens Market</a> on the grounds that a 31-storey block of flats would not be an \"appropriate\" addition to the neighbourhood. </p><p>Such is the mayor's eagerness of late to demonstrate his skyscraper aversion that he recently <a href=\"http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3856\">claimed credit</a> for reducing the height of the so-called \"ugly sisters\" due to sprout in Waterloo, when the decision had in fact been taken by Lambeth council months before he became mayor. Zeal, perhaps, had made him forgetful. Still, if this is a sign of his getting to grips with this issue, I may forgive him. </p><p>I'm always wary of lining up with harrumphers and haters of modernity in all its forms, but my gut feelings are getting harder to ignore. That number 48 bus route also takes me past a historic Shoreditch High Street bar and restaurant called the The Light, which has lately <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3130990\">won protection</a> against demolition to make way for a new Foster project: a victory for <a href=\"http://architectslive1.architectsjournal.co.uk/foster-+-partners-accused-of-misleading-bishops-place-public-consultation/1222157.article\">grassroots opposition</a>. </p><p>Further down, near Liverpool Street station, the <a href=\"http://www.skyscrapernews.com/heron.htm\">Heron Tower</a> continues to gain height. I anticipate its shadow. I wish that it would stop. The other evening, approaching Dalston on my way home, I found myself in unvarnished revolt against a <a href=\"http://www.dalstonsquare.co.uk/\">new local edifice</a> that blocked my view of a spectacular sky. All my earlier ambivalence was gone.

They like building tall buildings but they don't have to live or work in them.\"  </p><p>He added: \"Tall buildings are often more about power, prestige, status and aesthetics than efficient development.\"  </p><p>But one of Britain's senior architects hit back at the committee's findings. Marco Goldschmied, co-founder of the Richard Rogers Partnership, said: \"It is naive to think an architect could persuade a client to build a skyscraper just as a willy waving exercise. Are we saying that the whole of Manhattan, or Chicago, has been driven by that?  </p><p>\"What do we want - a homogeneous two storey suburbia? I don't think so.  </p><p>\"We should not be having an argument about tall versus short but beautiful versus ugly.\"  </p><p>The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, is singled out for criticism by the committee over his support for several high rise projects in the city.  </p><p>The report claims a rise in the number of high density buildings in central London will increase pressure on an already creaking transport system. \"The increase in proposals for tall buildings only underlines the need for a national policy advice to local authorities,\" it says.  </p><p>In a statement released yesterday, Mr Livingstone defended his policy, saying tall buildings were only part of a wide range of tools to achieve high density development and support urban renaissance. \"I see no need for further guidance from government on this issue, although I recognise that areas outside London may find this useful.\"  </p><p>The report is scathing about about the role of English Heritage and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe), which it warns are both at risk of losing public confidence.  </p><p>\"English Heritage opposes new tall buildings but protects old disastrous towers, and Cabe is seen as a defender of modern architecture,\" Mr Bennett said.  </p><p>But the Cabe deputy chairman, Paul Finch, rejected the allegation that the organisation supported all plans put before it.  </p><p>English Heritage also defended itself from the charges made by the committee, claiming that only a handful of the best tall buildings of the 1960s and 1970s were listed.  </p><p>\"Choosing which is a question of cultural significance, and ensuring that the most important buildings of any period are protected from unthinking, uncontrolled change,\" the statement continued.  </p><p>Elsewhere in the report the committee argues that tall buildings are not an essential part of urban renaissance and are not needed to curb suburban sprawl.  </p><p>\"They do not necessarily achieve higher densities than mid or low rise developments and in some cases are a less efficient use of space.\"  </p><p>The committee, which carried out a three month inquiry into the issue, is calling on the government to issue planning guidance for local authorities considering applications for high rise schemes, to avoid the ad hoc development of poorly planned buildings that took place in the 1960s.  </p><p>There is one bright spot for fans of skyscrapers: the report concluded that tall buildings were not inherently dangerous, despite the events of September 11.  </p><p>However, the committee did identify areas for improvement: \"Preventing tragedies such as that which occurred last September is almost impossible, but improved evacuation procedures and safety regulation may help to ensure preparedness for any eventualities.\"</p>","headline":"Tall buildings get short shrift in MPs' report","trailText":"<p>A parliamentary committee has launched a scathing

Housing the world's largest stock exchange for raw plastic material, it is the work of Italian architect Joseph di Pasquale, who says the form &ldquo;will be immediately perceived as a native Chinese landmark.&rdquo; Because it's big and brash and dressed in a spangly Christmas jumper? Maybe, but also because it is &ldquo;inspired by the strong iconic value of jade discs and numerological tradition of feng shui.&rdquo; How so? Because not only does the 50m-wide hole punched through the centre make it look like an ancient Chinese coin, but when the building is reflected in the river it forms the lucky number eight. And an infinity symbol. And the insignia of ancient dynasty that reigned in this area 2,000 years ago.</p> <h2><strong>The &ldquo;iconic ring-shape&rdquo; hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-88d9ea46-c332-4596-b6b2-fc94887c996d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389956798415/adb796ed-ed20-4fa4-90e4-256c28284478-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Iconic ring-shape … the Sheraton Huzhou is inspired by the form of a humpback bridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Iconic ring-shape &hellip; the Sheraton Huzhou is inspired by the form of a humpback bridge.

Designed by Beijing-based MAD Architects, the 27-storey ovoid arch apparently draws on the ancient humpback bridges of the region, and has been souped-up into a space-age glass and steel loop. &ldquo;Huzhou itself is a place famous for traditional ink paintings and splendid water views, and the arch bridge is one of the key elements of traditional architecture,&rdquo; says the building's architect, Ma Yansong. &ldquo;By incorporating this iconic ring-shape, my goal was to design a contemporary resort that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding environment while evoking the beautiful arch bridge over Taihu Lake.&rdquo;</p> <h2><strong>The melty hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-723cc47d-0aa1-4e2c-a46d-2ab7588247c0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389956911449/9b6cd887-246a-4ba6-9ec5-03784597d653-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ice cube chic … Zaha Hadid's design for the Opus Office Tower in Dubai.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ice cube chic &hellip; Zaha Hadid's design for the Opus Office Tower in Dubai.

Planned for the centre of Dubai's Business Bay, it is in fact two blocks, say the architects, conceived as &ldquo;a single cube eroded by a free-form void, which appears to 'hover' above ground level.&rdquo; A pixelated reflective facade makes it look solid by day, while by night, it &ldquo;dematerialises, as light floods the void&rdquo;. Launched at the British Museum in pre-crash euphoria, when the model was <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11296534\">dramatically revealed</a> from a block of ice, it has since been on hold &ndash; although may soon return, its innards effortlessly transformed from offices to a luxury hotel.</p> <h2><strong>The sky-high piazza hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2c363c5f-0ac4-401d-bf13-4eea3dbf215f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957203584/37543879-f6ed-45b3-9e16-21bac88dd28a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Flipped plaza … MVRDV's Mirador apartment block in Madrid has a public \"look out\" square cut out of the building.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Flipped plaza &hellip; MVRDV's Mirador apartment block in Madrid has a public \"look out\" square cut out of the building.

And what lies at the centre of every good neighbourhood, but a big open space? So the architects duly flipped that too, creating a &ldquo;look-out&rdquo; 40m above ground, an outdoor piazza and a community garden for &ldquo;monumentalising life and space&rdquo;. It's just a shame most parents find the 12-storey drop a bit of an off-putting place to let their toddlers loose.</p> <h2><strong>The broody pixelated hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c061f292-1e31-46b4-b9f2-dac5b3100e40\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957307416/de1809c4-a4cd-4aff-9244-6e67e29eefd4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Fun with shipping containers … OMA's proposal for Hamburg was formed of a stack of Tetris-like blocks.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Fun with shipping containers &hellip; OMA's proposal for Hamburg was formed of a stack of Tetris-like blocks. Image: OMA</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looks like someone had a wild time with the shipping container crane in Hamburg docks. Either that, or OMA is in town. Conceived as a great pile of Tetris blocks stacked in a crooked loop, the <a href=\"http://www.oma.eu/projects/2004/hamburg-science-center\">Hamburg Science Centre</a> was planned for the entrance to Magdeburger harbour in 2004, and would have included an aquarium, science theatre and exhibition spaces. Ever the pragmatists, OMA justified the form on purely practical grounds, explaining that &ldquo;the function of the 10 blocks that make up the building allow for large-scale programmatic changes on a daily basis.&rdquo; And, by pure subliminal coincidence, it bore a striking resemblance to a <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Rotterdam_kunstwerk_Margot_Zandstra.jpg\">sculpture outside OMA's Rotterdam HQ</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The portal-to-another-dimension hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-522fb1b1-6ab2-4a8c-8682-ad82190a6328\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957467101/0645dd01-f016-4c54-a59f-7428fefdbc74-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gaping portal … La Grande Arche de la Défense is twisted off axis to join up with Paris's other monuments.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Gaping portal &hellip; La Grande Arche de la D&eacute;fense is twisted off axis to join up with Paris's other monuments. Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure>  <p>More of a hole with a building around it than a building with a hole in it, La Grande Arche de la D&eacute;fense terminates the end of Paris's great Axe historique with a monumental void, big enough to hold Notre Dame cathedral. Designed by Danish architect Johann Otto von Spreckelsen in the 1980s, it was the winning scheme in a competition for a &ldquo;modern Arc de Triomphe&rdquo;, conceived as a &ldquo;monument to humanity&rdquo; rather than military victory. As if trying to suck the entire French capital in through its gaping mouth, it stands like a sinister portal to another dimension, subtly tilted off axis to connect with the Eiffel and Montparnasse Towers and the Louvre, forming a grand masonic geometry of which Baron Haussman would be proud.</p> <h2>The spiralling worm-hole</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a822107b-17e9-46ab-9024-624228cdccd6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957619588/13141051-6fd3-4ef3-83d9-46a848f60514-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Swiss cheese … BIG's design for a technology centre in Taiwan features a spiraling public route cut through the building.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Swiss cheese &hellip; BIG's design for a technology centre in Taiwan features a spiraling public route cut through the building.

A great shed of shops, showrooms, offices, conference rooms, exhibition spaces, restaurants and galleries, it is livened up by having a spiralling wormhole drilled all the way through the building, designed to suck the public in through its irresistible vortex. The entire block will be clad with step-spaced concrete fins that recede inwards, allowing people to climb into the facade and walk all the way up to the roof.</p> <h2><strong>The sinister Eye-of-Sauron hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7739749b-ae51-453f-bb99-fba78c8da3be\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957794897/17cda2a7-e441-4c63-8ad8-3af7150a3ec9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mordor awaits … Shanghai's World Financial Centre has a hole cut out to reduce wind loading.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Mordor awaits &hellip; Shanghai's World Financial Centre has a hole cut out to reduce wind loading.

The hole was originally going to be round, with a plan to install a ferris wheel inside it, but costs &ndash; and the potential terror factor of spinning around 500m in the air &ndash; meant the plan was binned. Still, despite looking like it might shoot out an Eye of Sauron deathray any second, it will make a nifty bottle-opener when the giants arrive.</p> <h2><strong>Oh and another pixelated hole</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f4bc449b-b32e-4409-88da-4e7abecb2e7b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389957906574/4bfbb395-37c0-43d6-a9e1-59a89924870a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Collaborative cloud … Ole Scheeren's design for the Axel Springer HQ is designed to \"reunite\" East and West Berlin.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Collaborative cloud &hellip; Ole Scheeren's design for the Axel Springer HQ is designed to \"reunite\" East and West Berlin.

A massive pixelated hole is the answer proposed by <a href=\"http://www.buro-os.com/axel_springer_en/\">Buro Ole Scheeren</a> &ndash; because, in the hands of the ex-OMA wunderkind, a gap can also be a bridge. &ldquo;At the core of the new building floats an urban-scale void, establishing a visual axis between former East and West and conceptually reuniting the two sides,&rdquo; says the architect. &ldquo;The building emerges as a symbol of transparency and historic awareness.&rdquo; But this gaping chasm, punched out of the heart of the building, is not any old hole: it's a &ldquo;'collaborative cloud', reuniting a multiplicity of enterprises in a space of shared digital identity.'&rdquo; Because of course, where buildings with holes in are concerned, &ldquo;identity is defined not as an object, but as space &ndash; a physical void is carved to create flexible permeable places for imagination, collaboration, and interaction.&rdquo;</p>","headline":"Holey moley!

It has also opened up a whole new world for those outside of newsrooms to tell their stories.</p><p>We believe that journalism gets stronger when these worlds collaborate. This is open journalism.</p><p>Today, in partnership with EE, we launch <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> – a new platform that takes the Guardian another step further on this open journalism journey. </p><p>Of course working with you, our readers, is something that the Guardian has always been proud to do.</p><p>We are lucky to have amazing communities that come to our site to share their passions and interests. From politics to poetry our community members regularly work with us to bring additional insight and depth to our coverage. </p><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greenland\">Greenland</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, West Africa's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guinea-bissau\">Guinea-Bissau</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tuvalu\">Tuvalu</a> in the Pacific, over the past year Guardian readers have accessed our site from almost every country in the world. Working together with our journalists - from picture and multimedia editors to correspondents and columnists - together we can help bring stories to light from across the globe.</p><p>In recent years alone, you have been involved in some of the biggest news stories of the age: helping us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/mps-expenses\">review MPs' expense claims</a>; providing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">eyewitness accounts of the Arab Spring</a>; unpicking<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarah-palin-emails\"> Sarah Palin's emails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\">covering</a> – and later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">understanding</a> - the UK riots.</p><p>When police told us that there was nothing suspicious about the death of the newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson, it was a reader that sent us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/07/ian-tomlinson-g20-death-video\">a video which clearly showed a police officer knocking Tomlinson to the ground</a>.

The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We'd like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings &shy;&ndash; the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are. Share your images using GuardianWitness &ndash; and if you get them to us before 10am on Friday 18th, the best will be published on the Guardian site.</p> <p>Closes 5pm Wednesday 24 April 2013.</p> <p><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.
