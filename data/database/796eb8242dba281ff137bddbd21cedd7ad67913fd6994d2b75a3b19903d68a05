It was the sixth, and most devastating, home defeat of what has been a long and painful debut season for the United manager.</p><p>The last time United lost six league matches at home was in 2002 and that is a statistic Rooney feels is unacceptable. \"It's not good enough,\" Rooney said in a frank interview with MUTV. \"We can't lose six homes games in a season and we have to put that right, and make this a place which teams fear again.\"</p><p>Edin Dzeko scored either side of half-time before Yaya Touré added a third in stoppage time to seal a win that will no doubt raise further questions about Moyes's future. The home fans who were left inside Old Trafford at the final whistle did not boo off their team but there was also a noticeable lack of songs in support of the United manager. Other supporters, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/sir-alex-ferguson-abused-fans-appointing-david-moyes\" title=\"\">vented their anger at former manager Sir Alex Ferguson over the appointment of Moyes</a>.</p><p>Rooney has pleaded with the United fans for patience, despite what has been a dreadful season. He added: \"They were great again tonight. As a team, we need them to be strong and to understand there has been a big change at the club.

And while City push for the title, United's very slim hopes of a top-four finish appear to have gone. Rooney acknowledged United did not do enough to take anything from the game.</p><p>\"It's a bad night and we didn't deserve to win,\" the United striker said. \"We weren't clinical enough and we didn't create enough chances. No one likes to lose a derby game – they're big games and they're great to win but when you lose it's not a great feeling.</p><p>\"It's probably been the story of our season so far, that we've got a couple of good results and then one which sets us back a bit.\"</p><p>United have a home game against Aston Villa on Saturday, which is followed by a daunting double-header against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Rooney wants the team to bounce back quickly to avoid further embarrassments, such as the one they endured on Tuesday night.</p><p>\"We know we have to respond,\" the England striker said. \"It's a bad night for us all but we have to move on.

Moyes keeps on suffering at Old Trafford as City take one of Manuel Pellegrini's 10 steps towards the title","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<h2>1 Moyes suffers at  Old Trafford. Again</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Verses of \"Fergie give us a wave, Fergie Fergie give us a wave\" and \"Moyesie give us a wave, Moyesie, Moyesie give us a wave\" were quickly followed by \"He's the Chosen One\" from the gleeful visiting Manchester City fans as the United manager felt 75,000 pairs of eyes burn into him. This was a scoreline that looked close for a large part of the game but make no mistake: Moyes's side were run off the park for most of the contest. Before kick-off the Scot had said: \"We will be doing everything we possibly can tonight to avenge the disappointing result we had at the Etihad Stadium earlier this season.</p><p>\"At this present time, we sit behind City in the Premier League table, but that is something we will look to rectify in the future. The title race is something we're aiming to be involved in he future, just as we have in the past.\" This feels a long way away at the moment.</p><h2>2 Dzeko steps up to score another two 'heavy goals' </h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Cometh the 167th Mancunian squabble, cometh Edin Dzeko, the maligned striker who, as David Platt once said, scores \"heavy goals\". Here he was at it again, netting twice with the aplomb sometimes glaringly missing from his game. Not this night. As with the rest of his colleagues Dzeko coasted through the match and it is must have been with some satisfaction that when he wandered off with 11 minutes left it was Álvaro Negredo, the man he has usurped in the XI, who came on for him.</p><p>More materially, the 28-year-old's finishes hand City a vital victory. \"Winning today is one of ten steps that we must take towards the title. We hope that we can play as well as we did at the Etihad in September.\" So said the City manager, Manuel Pellegrini, who also claimed in his pre-match interview that City were not favourites for this match. If they win at the Emirates this weekend, it is their crown to lose.</p><h2>3 Has anyone seen Juan Mata's Chelsea form?</h2><p><strong>  </strong></p><p>The Spaniard scored an impressive 19 times for the west London club last season yet since his club record £37m transfer to United in January Mata has hardly had a sniff of a debut strike despite his stated intention to start piling them up. \"Of course I want to score goals – that is a big aim for me, and I will try and provide more assists. But it is all about winning for us. The collective aim of the team is more important than any personal ones. As long as we win every game until the end of the season, I will be very happy,\" he said very early on in his United career.</p><p>With that prospect ebbing away with every advancing minute, Mata must have wondered what had happened to the opportunity that supposedly knocked with Robin van Persie's injury. This was supposed to open up the stage for Mata to become orchestrator of a fluid United side. Instead, as has been the script so far, he was peripheral, at best.</p><h2>4 Scholes spot on with  criticism of Fellaini </h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The ghost of Paul Scholes haunted United's second-rate midfield as the retired midfield maestro said of Marouane Fellaini in a pre-match interview: \"He's not been great, has he? You have to admit that. He did have problems with his wrist and I know he missed a lot of games but, for the money they paid for him, I'd be expecting a lot more, to be honest with you. I'd be expecting a few goals, at least. For a central midfielder at Manchester United for £27m, I'm expecting a few goals.\" Ouch. Scholes' dissection of the Belgian's contribution was underlined in a timid performance that was hardly the offering of a near-£30m player. In this he was not alone though, as Tom Cleverley, who with Michael Carrick made up United's midfield trio, lasted just the first half before being replaced: against Yaya Touré, Fernandinho and David Silva, their inferiority was clear.</p><h2>5 43 seconds of United  sluggishness set the tone  </h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>City needed less than a minute to plant their flag in enemy territory, with the Edin Dzeko goal that immediately crushed any optimism built up from the wins over Olympiakos and West Ham United in the home team's previous outings. For Moyes's team to hand their fierce rivals such an early present was hardly the best way to hope to narrow the points gap to their cross-town rivals from the yawning 12 it was at kick-off.</p><p>The sluggishness that allowed Silva, Touré and Nasri to walk through the defence ahead of Dzeko's opener offered yet more ammunition to those who see a United squad this year who are yet to be completely convinced of their manager and so are that vital fraction slower. To be fair to United – and Moyes – they rallied well following the initial shaky period but to let the enemy raid you after less than a minute is not good enough in a derby, or any other match for that matter. And if the start had been bad then the ending was equally gruesome, Touré scoring a magnificent goal to secure an easy 3-0 win.</p>","headline":"Manchester United 0-3 Manchester City: five talking points","trailText":"<strong>Jamie Jackson:</strong> David Moyes keeps on suffering at Old Trafford as City take one of Manuel Pellegrini's 10 steps towards the title","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395787275874/David-Moyes-003.jpg","wordcount":"875","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T22:42:49Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/25/manchester-united-manchester-city-david-moyes","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/25/manchester-united-manchester-city-david-moyes","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/manchester-united","webTitle":"Manchester United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchester-united","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jamiejackson","webTitle":"Jamie Jackson","r2ContributorId":"19396","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/11/11/jamiejacks.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jamie Jackson is the Manchester football correspondent for the Guardian and Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamiejackson","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432988506","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395787270574/David-Moyes-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Action Images","photographer":"Carl Recine","altText":"David Moyes","height":"54","credit":"Carl Recine/Action Images","caption":"David Moyes looks on as Manchester United fans leave their 3-0 home defeat by Manchester City early.

If securing a place in Europe's premier competition still represents a fairly tough task for Roberto Martínez's beautifully, and bravely, constructed side, the daunting scale of the rebuilding job required at Newcastle United this summer was fully emphasised.</p><p>The home team may have left it far too late to liberate Hatem Ben Arfa from the bench but they would probably always have been second-best to a wonderfully cohesive Everton, whose gameplan left plenty of room for improvisation from Barkley and the equally eye-catching Barcelona loanee Gerard Deulofeu.</p><p>One place and six points behind fourth-placed Arsenal but with a game in hand, Martínez is a happy man at present. \"I'm proud of the performance, we never allowed Newcastle to feel at ease,\" he said. \"Not many players can score a goal like Ross did, technically he's as gifted as you're going to get but he's also got real physical power. I know Ross will be a phenomenon.\"</p><p>While Martínez believes the \"mature\" 20-year-old is \"ready\" to play for England at the World Cup, much more of this and Deulofeu will be wanted back at Camp Nou. \"Gerard's quite unique,\" said Martínez. \"I'd pay to watch him.\"</p><p>Perhaps noting that Martínez had only selected one natural defensive midfielder in Gareth Barry, Newcastle began at a ferocious tempo which temporarily unhinged their visitors.</p><p>This entirely deceptive early storm soon passed. Indeed once Luuk de Jong's shot had been deflected to safety and one apiece from Yoan Gouffran and Papiss Cissé were blocked, Everton regrouped to devastating effect. With Deulofeu and Barkley cleverly supporting Romelu Lukaku in attack, it was not long before Martínez's players were giving Newcastle quite a few frights. Deulofeu especially was giving the home defence, and the left-back Paul Dummett in particular, a torrid time.</p><p>Tim Krul made a splendid save to keep Lukaku's low shot out at the end of a gloriously slick build-up featuring Barry, Barkley and Leon Osman, whose adroit pass bisected two defenders.</p><p>The verve and vision of Martínez's ensemble were already making Newcastle appear dull, direct and, at best, two dimensional when the evening reached a key juncture as  Deulofeu nudged the ball to Barkley.</p><p><a href=\"https://vine.co/v/MOmAXOQbDiO\" title=\"\">Around 70 yards from goal, </a>he embarked on a surging run. Leaving the badly positioned Dummett – looking an increasingly weak link – and the wrong-footed Fabricio Coloccini among the defensive platoon left trailing in his powerful yet poised wake, the 20-year-old then traversed the edge of the penalty area.</p><p>By way of proving he could most definitely finish what he started, Barkley concluded matters by curling a high velocity left-foot shot beyond Krul's grasp and into the roof of the net. It is no exaggeration to say the goal contained shades of Maradona at the 1986 World Cup.</p><p>Energetic, competitive and with Cissé appearing sharp, Alan Pardew's side had dropped regular hints that they could undo Martínez's sometimes vulnerable defence but they lacked Everton's subtlety, control and creativity.</p><p>Deulofeu may occasionally have overdone his beloved stepover routines but Newcastle supporters craved similar precocity. Mild Geordie optimism prompted by the sight of Ben Arfa warming up was soon crushed as Lukaku lashed Everton's second into the roof of the net from close range. Beginning with Osman's chipped  pass, it arrived following a fine cross from Deulofeu – demonstrating he is as much about incision as fancy footwork – and was gratefully seized on by Lukaku.</p><p>John Carver, deputising in the technical area while Pardew served the final game of his stadium ban, wasted no time in replacing De Jong with Ben Arfa, and Martínez immediately ordered James McCarthy to keep a close eye on a newcomer who also had Leighton Baines to contend with.</p><p>Undeterred, the French winger helped Newcastle raise their game. Gouffran sent a volley whizzing fractionally over the bar and Vurnon Anita shot wastefully wide from a Ben Arfa cross, but Martínez's men were not quite done.</p><p>Shortly after Krul's excellent save denied Lukaku, Osman shot unerringly into the top corner following another gorgeous preamble, this time involving Steven Naismith, Deulofeu and Lukaku.</p><p>\"I should have a black suit on,\" said Carver. \"We've come up against a really good side. The way their manager has got them playing is a credit to him.\"</p>","headline":"Everton's Barkley evokes memories of Maradona as Newcastle slump at home","trailText":"<p>Everton's Ross Barkley scored a fine solo goal that typified their dominance at St James' Park, where Newcastle found themselves out-played</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395784754026/Evertons-Barkley-004.jpg","wordcount":"719","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T22:02:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/newcastle-united-everton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/25/newcastle-united-everton-premier-league-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/newcastleunited","webTitle":"Newcastle United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/newcastleunited","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/31"}]},{"id":"football/everton","webTitle":"Everton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/everton","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/8"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/louisetaylor","webTitle":"Louise Taylor","r2ContributorId":"22724","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/18/louisetaylor.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Louise Taylor is north-east football correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisetaylor","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/louisetaylor","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/8"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/31"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433031947","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395784754026/Evertons-Barkley-004.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Nigel Roddis","altText":"Everton's Barkley","height":"84","credit":"Nigel Roddis/Reuters","caption":"Ross Barkley celebrates after scoring a fine solo goal against Newcastle at St James' Park.

2-2 Swansea City | Premier League match report","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-25T21:57:20Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","id":"football/2014/mar/25/arsenal-swansea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3npcp","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>When the killer blow for Arsenal came, with mere seconds of normal time remaining, it seemed somehow appropriate that it should be cloaked in black comedy. Three precious points appeared to be theirs and they stood not only to crown a fightback that had hardly been trailed, but to soothe the pain of the 6-0 humbling at Chelsea from last Saturday.</p><p>But Swansea City, and fate, had other ideas. When Leon Britton drove into the penalty area, after a one-two with Angel Rangel, Per Mertesacker dived in to challenge and briefly chaos reigned.</p><p>Mertesacker's tackle diverted the ball at Wojciech Szczesny and after it hit the goalkeeper it squirted back at Mathieu Flamini. Flamini, sliding towards his  net, could do nothing as the ball ricocheted off him and trickled in for the most sickening of own goals. Everybody in red was gripped by that sinking feeling.</p><p>Arsenal's comeback had been fired by the substitute Lukas Podolski. He scored one goal and made the other for Olivier Giroud as Arsenal stood the game on its head inside 60 second-half seconds and looked set to banish the demons of Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Yet the late sucker punch seemed to catch the downbeat mood at Arsenal, the sense that their Premier League title challenge has come apart. It might have been even worse for them at the bitter end but for a refereeing decision that incensed the Swansea head coach, Garry Monk, and his players.</p><p>Jonathan de Guzmán was through on goal, being chased by Thomas Vermaelen and with Szczesny to beat, when Lee Probert decided to blow for full-time. Four minutes of injury time had been signalled and the game had entered the fifth but Monk argued that because the Flamini own goal had come virtually on 90 minutes, an extra minute over the four ought to have been added.</p><p>He also expressed his amazement that Probert should blow up when a major opportunity knocked. It was the first time in his career, Monk said, that he had seen such a situation. De Guzmán stuck the ball home, although both Vermaelen and Szczesny had stopped, and angry Swansea players surrounded the referee at full-time.</p><p>Monk's delight at the point that he would have taken beforehand, and also after Giroud's goal, was sorely tempered, and Arsène Wenger talked afterwards of how deeply the result had hurt.</p><p>He complained about a foul in the build-up to the Swansea equaliser and he took issue with Monk's argument about the De Guzmán controversy. Vermaelen, Wenger said, was in position to catch him. Nobody was happy. Arsenal have now drawn after each of their Premier League drubbings – Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea – but this one seemed like a defeat.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-433020657\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/26/140326Arsenal-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/26/140326Arsenal_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/26/140326Arsenal_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/26/140326Arsenal/140326Arsenal.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/26//140326Arsenal.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>The main thing that has sustained Arsenal throughout the assorted pitfalls of their season has been the ability to beat the teams that they ought to be beating, namely those in the bottom half of the table. Not here and, as the dust settled, Wenger was more concerned with the threat to his club's top-four ambitions from Everton.</p><p>This was yet another occasion when Arsenal's nerves jangled and there was the collective offering-up of prayers from the home seats when Wilfried Bony flexed those mighty neck muscles to thump an early header down and into the near corner of the net.</p><p>The goal was the definition of simplicity. Neil Taylor ambled up the inside-left channel before hanging over a cross for Bony to attack. He beat Vermaelen to bring up his 20th goal of the season. The £12m invested on him last summer looks extremely smart. His all-round performance was immense. Monk described him as a \"beast\".</p><p>Arsenal had plenty of the game but they laboured for a cutting edge despite the best efforts of Santi Cazorla. He had the pick of the limited crop of first-half chances when he took a ball from Tomas Rosicky, skated past a couple of challenges and forced Michel Vorm into a save.</p><p>The home fans wrestled with a familiar internal struggle, between bellowing their backing and venting their angst. Every misplaced Arsenal pass, and there were plenty, drew howls, and there were loud boos at half-time. Swansea's centre-halves, Ashley Williams and Chico Flores, were excellent and as the second-half minutes ticked by, Arsenal stared disaster in the face.</p><p>The pendulum swung in what seemed like the blink of an eye. Wenger's team went from wondering where the inspiration might come from – with Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere, Mesut Özil and Theo Walcott injured – to saluting Podolski's impact. Kieran Gibbs was the architect of the equaliser, accelerating past Rangel to cut back from the byline for Podolski, whose body shape was perfect to execute a difficult side-on volley.</p><p>Swansea lapsed again at the restart and, rather abruptly, another committed performance under Monk looked as though it would count for nothing. Angel gave away possession and when Cazorla nodded forward for Podolski, his cross was made to measure for Giroud.</p><p>The drama, though, was just beginning.</p>","headline":"Arsenal own goal by Mathieu Flamini gifts late point to Swansea","trailText":"<p>A late own goal denied Arsenal victory after Wilfried Bony had given Swansea City an early lead in a 2-2 draw at the Emirates</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395779240116/Wilfried-Bony-Swansea-Cit-004.jpg","wordcount":"819","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T21:57:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/arsenal-swansea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/25/arsenal-swansea-premier-league-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/arsenal","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}]},{"id":"football/swansea","webTitle":"Swansea City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/swansea","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/swansea","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/65"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidhytner","webTitle":"David Hytner","r2ContributorId":"22566","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/10/07/hytner.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Hytner is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football</a> correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidhytner","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidhytner","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/65"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433022311","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395779235834/Wilfried-Bony-Swansea-Cit-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Matt Dunham","altText":"Wilfried Bony Swansea City","height":"54","credit":"Matt Dunham/AP","caption":"Wilfried Bony, left, scores the opening goal for Swansea City at Arsenal.

the Premier League. Manuel Pellegrini's team played as though determined to make Manchester United suffer and by the time they had finished, David Moyes may have heard the first isolated shouts behind his dugout to get out of the club, and preferably through the back door.</p><p>For now it still amounted to a show of restraint considering he inherited a team, lest it be forgotten, that won the league by 11 points. The regression is nothing short of remarkable and the indignities continue to stack up. United certainly lived up to Sir Bobby Charlton's admission about having played \"really, really badly\" this season and Mancunian humour has a brutal edge on these occasions. \"Worst champions we've ever seen\" was the chant from the away end, expletive removed.</p><p>Moyes' new system, forfeiting width in an attempt to pin down City's midfield, failed within the first minute and Edin Dzeko's goal, officially clocked at 43 seconds, was followed by a performance of almost total superiority from Pellegrini's men, easing above Liverpool into second place with two games in hand on Chelsea and three points to make up.</p><p>City played like champions whereas United looked what they are these days: a team in seventh position, grubbing around for points to qualify for the Europa League, but in trouble as soon as they come up against one of the top teams. Dzeko's second goal arrived after 56 minutes and Moyes should probably be grateful the crowd did not let out more frustration after Yaya Touré completed the scoring.</p><p>United are now guaranteed their most undistinguished points total in the Premier League era and it is the first time City have beaten them three times running at this ground for more than 40 years. It is shocking to see the scale of deterioration at Old Trafford.</p><p>Pellegrini's men started like a team in a hurry, inflicted the necessary damage and coasted through the final half an hour before Touré drilled in the third goal just as the electronic board was flashing up the added time. They moved the ball quickly, with invention and clarity. There was not a flicker of trepidation and as soon as they took that early lead everyone must have sensed this could be another ordeal for the home team.</p><p>A blur of speed and movement culminated in Samir Nasri's shot ricocheting off a post for Dzeko to score from inside the six-yard area. United were all over the place and, straight away, there was the hard evidence about where these old rivals currently stand. The truth – and it is undeniable – is that the gulf in talent was evident all night.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-433024223\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/26/140326ManUnited-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/26/140326ManUnited/140326ManUnited.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/26/140326ManUnited_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/26//140326ManUnited.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/26/140326ManUnited_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>More than anything, City had the speed to hurt the home team. Jesús Navas was a formidable opponent for the creaking Patrice Evra. On the opposite side, Rafael da Silva looked just as vulnerable. City simply overpowered the home team. David Silva was tremendous, such an elusive and clever player. Touré demonstrated why Pellegrini had described him beforehand as \"the complete midfielder\" and Dzeko played with the sureness of touch that occasionally deserts him.</p><p>The irony was that Moyes had shoehorned in another central midfielder, Tom Cleverley, at the expense of a right-winger to try to cope with City's superiority in this area. Still, however, Pellegrini's men poured through the gaps. Cleverley was removed at half-time and is in danger of becoming the player the crowd trust the least. Shinji Kagawa could not make any real difference and Marouane Fellaini continues to look hopelessly out of his depth. The player Moyes signed from Everton for £27m offered little in a passing sense and, not for the first time, the crowd revelled in his substitution.</p><p>As for the elbow Fellaini delivered into Pablo Zabaleta's jaw, half an hour in, it really was a dereliction of duty from the referee, Michael Oliver, not to show a red card. Fellaini has previous for these kind of offences and this one looked premeditated.</p><p>If City had been more clinical they could have wrapped up the game in that opening half. Wayne Rooney was determined not to let the game pass him by and United did at least create a couple of chances before the break.</p><p>Yet this was not a fully coherent football team. In defence there were more lapses than they will care to remember. United's midfield was laboured. They have scored 18 league goals here all season – even in the year of the infamous \"Ta-ra, Fergie\" banner, they managed 26 – and it does not reflect well on Moyes that Paul Scholes' analysis, in a television role, was much clearer than the manager's.</p><p>Early in the second half the outstanding Vincent Kompany headed on a corner and Fernandinho flashed the ball over the crossbar. There was a warning there for United and it went unheeded. At the next corner, Rio Ferdinand started tracking Dzeko but ran into Fellaini. Dzeko, left alone, ran on to Nasri's cross and expertly volleyed in his shot.</p><p>Touré's goal was a low diagonal drive into the bottom corner and that was the moment City's fans celebrated the Moyes era, in <em>schadenfreude</em>, again. \"Five more years\" they sang, toasting a night that could go a long way to determining whether they are reunited with the Premier League trophy.</p>","headline":"Manchester City brush past United to close in on league leaders Chelsea","trailText":"<p>Edin Dzeko's double, including a first-minute goal, helped Manchester City to record a 3-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, with Yaya Touré adding the third</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395781635680/Edin-Dzeko-003.jpg","wordcount":"884","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T21:48:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/manchester-united-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/25/manchester-united-city-premier-league-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/manchester-united","webTitle":"Manchester United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchester-united","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.

West Ham were beaten at Everton and Stoke before losing  at home to Manchester United on Saturday.</p><p>Those losses mean the Hammers are six points clear of the relegation zone having played two games more than 18th-placed Sunderland, and they tackle Hull City at Upton Park on Wednesday evening looking to rediscover the winning habit.</p><p>For Allardyce it is not the first time he has had to address a worrying run this season, following a spell of seven Premier League games without a win throughout December and January.</p><p>Now the 59-year-old, who kept his job during that difficult stage, is at a loss to pinpoint why his side are suffering a similar slump – beyond them lacking a clinical edge in attack and defence.</p><p>\"We haven't achieved the results that the performances warranted,\" Allardyce claimed. \"That is the disappointment for me because we knew the bad times we had in December and January were really down to the limited players we had available. At the moment we have just not got that instinctive, killer edge on the front line, and because we are going all out for it we have left the back door open a couple of times and the opposition have taken full advantage of that.\"</p><p>Joey O'Brien and Marco Borriello will definitely miss the game against Hull as Allardyce attempts to halt the slide. The manager has been impressed with the job Steve Bruce has done at the KC Stadium since getting the Tigers promoted last season and despite highlighting the January signings of Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic, he is wary of Hull's entire forward line.</p><p>\"The additions Steve has made have turned them into a side who, in their first season, look more than capable of being safe in the Premier League,\" Allardyce said. \"He did his [transfer] business before the start of the season and then some in January which pushed them on again.\"</p>","headline":"Sam Allardyce hopes West Ham will find 'killer edge' against Hull","trailText":"Sam Allardyce has said he finds it hard to find a reason for West Ham United's run of defeats before the visit of Hull City","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395778419353/Sam-Allardyce-West-Ham-006.jpg","wordcount":"385","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T20:24:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/sam-allardyce-west-ham-edge-hull","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/25/sam-allardyce-west-ham-edge-hull","tags":[{"id":"football/westhamunited","webTitle":"West Ham United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/westhamunited","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"}]},{"id":"football/sam-allardyce","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sam-allardyce","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432978670","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395778411112/Sam-Allardyce-West-Ham-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Adam Davy","altText":"Sam Allardyce West Ham","height":"54","credit":"Adam Davy/PA","caption":"Sam Allardyce says West Ham have lost focus in attack and defence in recent games.

Despite not benefitting from the \"financial doping\" that Wenger says falsifies the Premier League title race, Rodgers, in only his second full season at Anfield, has guided Liverpool into a position to do what Wenger has been trying and failing to achieve for the past 10 years: win the league with a swagger.</p><p>The purpose of the comparison with Wenger is not to aim a gratuitous kick at the Frenchman but rather to acclaim a manager who has an equally strong commitment to playing attractive football but has applied it with greater intelligence.</p><p>Liverpool may ultimately fall short of top spot this season and could even finish below Arsenal but the progress made by the club in the past year bears testament to the methods of a manager with whom the Merseyside club can look forward to an exciting future.</p><p>The rise of Liverpool from seventh place last season to title challengers at the sharp end of this one is often presented as a triumph of Rodgers' master plan. That is not quite right. Yes, the 41-year-old has a philosophy but things have not panned out precisely as he foresaw and perhaps the most admirable aspect of his work in the past year has been the extent to which he has adapted to circumstances, opponents and his own mistakes, all while retaining a clear identity.</p><p>Where Arsenal are constrained by Wenger's dogmatism, Liverpool have prospered from Rodgers' flexibility.</p><p>The former Swansea City manager was quick to realise that \"the right way\" is the wrong way if it does not work. And he has then found the right way – or rather the right ways, since one of the hallmarks of Liverpool this season has been the frequency with which they have changed formations or personnel from game to game or within games, using slightly different means to reach the same end.</p><p>The most obvious quality that Rodgers has added to Liverpool this season is penetration. This season they have scored 25 more goals than they had done at the same stage last term, despite averaging 3% less possession per match: they have attacked with greater speed, unhinging defences with devastating movement and technique; players' imagination flourishing in space wrought by the manager's design. Opponents never quite know what shape Liverpool will start with.</p><p>He introduced a three-man defence to get Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge firing together when the Uruguayan returned from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/24/luis-suarez-10-games-ban-liverpool\" title=\"\">ban that ruled him out of the first five matches</a>, and since then Liverpool have also lined up in 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2.</p><p>At Southampton at the start of this month Liverpool began with a diamond in midfield for the first time this season and took an early lead. Southampton then threatened to equalise so Rodgers switched to 4-3-3 and regained the initiative, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/01/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool running out 3-0 winners</a>. He then redeployed the diamond at Old Trafford and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">cruised to another 3-0 win</a>.</p><p>In January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/18/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool were trailing 2-0 at home to Aston Villa</a> before Rodgers sacrificed his playmaker, Philippe Coutinho, and brought on Lucas Leiva to lay the platform for a fightback to 2-2. \"For me the system is irrelevant,\" Rodgers said after that. \"But the style will always be maintained, to control and dominate games.\"</p><p>Rodgers is derided for spouting David Brent-style soundbites but in fact his utterances are another manifestation of his efficiency. He condenses his thought to easily digested units. His tinkering is born of the same efficiency. He is not a self-regarding manager who changes for the sake of it. Liverpool, indeed, have made fewer substitutions (71) than any other team in the league this season.</p><p>Rodgers's mid-game changes tend to work but, with a limited squad that was not reinforced in January, he makes them only when necessary – and that is not very often because his original game plan is usually the right one, as shown by Liverpool's superb first-half record, the best in the league.</p><p>Further evidence of the clarity of Rodgers's vision and communication is the extent to which individual players have improved under him to better serve the collective. His coaching works. Sturridge and Jordan Henderson have consistently shown the potential that only flickered under others.</p><p>So few people, meanwhile, saw the potential in Jon Flanagan that what distinguished him in the Liverpool reserves was that no lower league clubs sought him on loan, yet the 21-year-old has filled in at left-back with gusto in recent months. Flanagan has won the same number of tackles as Southampton's new England international left-back Luke Shaw has this season, despite playing in only half as many matches.</p><p>The list of player improvements goes on – and it has been needed because, although they have been spared a European expedition this season, Liverpool have still had to work around the absences of key players, with Suárez banned for the first five league matches, Sturridge and Coutinho enduring significant injury lay-offs and full-backs falling like dominoes.</p><p>Rodgers has had to improvise and ensure his players do so as well. They have usually obliged. Raheem Sterling has evolved from a rapid and tricky winger into a rapid and tricky winger with the poise and precision to function also as a bona fide playmaker, diminishing the dependency on Coutinho.</p><p>Joe Allen has redefined his game to re-emerge from the sidelines in recent weeks – the midfielder, a decaffeinated additive last term, has given the side real pep by nearly doubling the number of tackles he makes per match (from 2.53 to 4.42) this season to overtake the figures of Liverpool's most prolific tackler last season (Lucas, 4.33), thereby softening the impact of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/21/lucas-leiva-liverpool-two-months\" title=\"\">the loss of Lucas to injury</a>.</p><p>And it is not only young players whom Rodgers has nurtured: Martin Skrtel seemed destined for the Anfield exit but has become the club's most dependable centre-back, which is just as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/liverpool-sign-tiago-ilori\" title=\"\">the £16m signing Mamadou Sakho</a> has been out injured for long periods. And, of course, Steven Gerrard has performed his new deep-lying midfield role with a considered effectiveness that is unlikely to have come to him naturally.</p><p>Not everything is rosy in the garden. The defence retains a brittleness that suggests there is only so much improvement even a top coach such as Rodgers can wring from some players and further investment in the summer will be required.</p><p>And Rodgers's investment record is not spotless, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/23/liverpool-confirm-signing-iago-aspas\" title=\"\">Iago Aspas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/22/liverpool-sign-luis-alberto-sevilla\" title=\"\">Luis Alberto</a>, for instance, have yet to justify the millions spent on them, although giving up on them now would be premature.</p><p>For Rodgers has restored hope to Liverpool through skill, imagination and realism.</p>","headline":"Liverpool prosper from flexible philosophy of Brendan

Gibbs has red card against Chelsea rescinded <br />• Andre Marriner appointed to referee Southampton v Newcastle","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Andre Marriner has been spared the indignity of a temporary demotion from the elite list of select group referees and will officiate in the Premier League this weekend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">despite sending off the wrong player during Arsenal's thrashing at Chelsea</a> last Saturday.</p><p>The Birmingham official will take charge of Southampton's game against Newcastle United at St Mary's, with Professional Game Match Officials Limited, the body that appoints referees for England's top flight, having considered his mistake as an isolated error. Marriner had sent off Kieran Gibbs for deliberate handball in preventing a goalscoring opportunity, when it had actually been Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain diving to his left on the far post to tip away Eden Hazard's shot.</p><p>Neither player is to serve a suspension as a result of the incident early in the derby at Stamford Bridge, with an independent regulatory commission confirming on Monday that Gibbs's red card had been a case of mistaken identity and determining that Oxlade-Chamberlain did not warrant a dismissal as Hazard's shot had been drifting wide. Arsenal's appeals were therefore upheld, with the pair available for Tuesday's visit of Swansea to the Emirates Stadium.</p><p>The fact that Oxlade-Chamberlain's offence was not deemed, in the commission's view,  to be a red card hardly reflects well on Marriner, who had apologised to Arsenal's manager, Arsène Wenger, and Gibbs in the wake of Saturday's error. The referee is understood to have been left distraught by his mistake, although colleagues on the 18-strong elite panel of referees have rallied around him at their fortnightly training at St George's Park. The incident was discussed among the officials in their technical session overseen by Mike Riley on Monday – the referees also undertake physical training and testing on their two-day meet – with the onus very much on learning lessons to avoid a repetition.</p><p>Marriner had apparently been unsighted by the diving goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, and had immediately sought clarification from his assistant referees and fourth official over what precisely had occurred at the far post. However, while the additional officials confirmed an offence had taken place that warranted a penalty, they were unable to determine the identity of the player concerned. The referee, who has conceded he should have moved immediately to identify which Arsenal player was lying on the turf after his dive, therefore stuck with his initial assessment and sent off Gibbs, despite both players' protestations to the contrary.</p><p>PGMOL had the option to relegate Marriner to the Football League for a week as punishment for his error but prefer to resort to that tactic only when an official has been guilty of consistently underperforming in the top flight. For what is considered a one-off error – and cases of mistaken identity remain rare – the favoured tactic is for the official to \"get back on the horse\" at the first opportunity. He had not been allocated a fixture in midweek but the game at St Mary's offers Marriner a chance to make amends of sorts.</p>","headline":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs cleared for Arsenal","trailText":"The Football Association has said Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be available for Arsenal's game against Swansea on Tuesday","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395684829303/Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-006.jpg","wordcount":"491","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T18:23:31Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/24/kieran-gibbs-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-cleared-arsenal-red-card-handball-swansea","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/24/kieran-gibbs-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-cleared-arsenal-red-card-handball-swansea","tags":[{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/arsenal","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}]},{"id":"profile/dominicfifield","webTitle":"Dominic Fifield","rcsId":"GNL004637","r2ContributorId":"15597","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381399399489/Dominic-Fifield-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Fifield is the Guardian's London <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football</a> correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominicfifield","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominicfifield","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"football/chelsea","webTitle":"Chelsea","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/chelsea","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/4"}]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/4"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432893392","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395684820282/Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"REUTERS","photographer":"Eddie Keogh","altText":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain","height":"54","credit":"Eddie Keogh/REUTERS","caption":"Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain complains to referee Andrer Marriner over his decision to send the wrong player off against Chelsea.

In the morning he had become the highest-profile footballer to announce he is gay, and in the hours afterwards he had not checked the public reaction. When I speak to him I tell him that support has been flooding in from fans, fellow footballers, well-wishers – and yes, even Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband.</p><p>\"But where's David Cameron?\" the former Germany international asks with playful indignation. \"He's a Villa supporter, after all!\" The prime minister, as it turns out, would soon add his voice to a raft of high-profile well-wishers that included Angela Merkel, the German national team manager Joachim Löw, and the former German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle, who is also gay.</p><p>They all talked about the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder's \"courage\" in breaking one of sport's last great taboos: Hitzlsperger, capped 52 times by his country, is the first German footballer to reveal he is gay. He is also the first former Premier League footballer to do so.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663313'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218698171/Thomas-Hitzlsperger-in-hi-001.jpg' alt='Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</figcaption></figure><p>It was a moment he always knew would come, and one he dreaded. The decision to address this issue publicly was a \"hard, difficult one\" that took a number of years to gestate, he tells me. The 31-year-old, who retired from the game last year because of injuries, first told his friends and family.</p><p>\"I was surprised and happy that they were all totally OK with it. Where I come from, in rural Bavaria, homosexuality is considered 'un-normal'. I knew that there would be negative reactions from those who will never understand it, also towards my family, but that didn't bother them. I've had nothing but total support from them.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who was engaged to his childhood sweetheart and broke up with her shortly before the scheduled wedding six years ago, was not certain of his sexual orientation until his career was almost over. \"I finally figured out that I preferred living with a man,\" he says.</p><p>He had thought about coming out while still playing for Wolfsburg in 2011-12 but then listened to people who warned him of the negative consequences. \"They all said 'don't do it, a big wave will crash on you',\" he says. \"But in the end I realised that nobody knows. There was no precedent, so everybody could only speculate on what would happen.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663314'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218865897/Hitzlsperger-in-action-fo-004.jpg' alt='Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side. Photograph: Peter Kneffel/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>While Germany as a country has noticeably become more and more relaxed about homosexuality in recent years, he had also noted there was an unhelpful media obsession with finding the first gay footballer. All sorts of well-intended but ultimately unhelpful interventions from heterosexual players – who either opined that gay players would benefit from coming out or cautioned against it – did not exactly fill him with confidence that this was indeed the right step.</p><p>Homosexuality was rarely a big topic in any of the dressing rooms he encountered, he says, and \"the subject only came up when people were speculating about someone else's sexuality, but never in their presence.\"</p><p>There was the odd incidence of crass homophobia, as well, \"but that was just your general, non-specific football talk,\" says Hitzlsperger. \"I too, used derogatory terms like 'what a gay pass' without thinking about it when I was younger.\"</p><p>The former international, who played in the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 European Championship, maintains that he did not have to lie about his sexuality and that team-mates eventually stopped asking about his lack of a girlfriend.</p><p>In any case, he says, an ultimately fruitless battle to regain full fitness after a series of operations was more important to him than telling his colleagues about his sexual orientation.</p><p>The announcement of his retirement last September brought more time to think, however. \"It really helped me to see that other professional sports people were acknowledging their sexuality. I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley. They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international. I wanted to encourage them, the way that those guys and Robbie Rogers encouraged me.\"</p><p>He closely studied the fall-out of their coming outs, too, he says, and felt empowered. \"They all said it was good for them.\" Hitzlsperger is unwilling to make wide-scale recommendations – \"everyone has to decide for themselves\" – and is unwilling to predict when the first active footballer in a European top league will follow his lead.</p><p>\"But the important thing for me is to show that being homosexual and professional football player is something that is normal. The perceived contradiction between playing football, the man's game, and being homosexual is nonsense. I don't think anyone has ever come away from watching a game with me thinking there's something wrong or 'too soft' with my game,\" he adds, with a chuckle.</p><p>Known as \"the Hammer\" among supporters because of his fierce shot with his left foot, Hitzlsperger always enjoyed a robust challenge.</p><p>\"You hear the word courage a lot,\" he says, when the talk  returns to the reactions he has experienced so far. \"That's nice to hear, but it's part of the problem, of course. That's something that should change. I sincerely hope that we'll see the when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances anymore, because it will be seen as totally normal that a sports person will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends. It won't be easy for the next person to be the truly the first in that regard but maybe I've been able to help them a tiny bit.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who has addressed issues such as racism and antisemitism in German football before, is acutely aware that there is a political dimension to his move, with the Olympic Games in Sochi about to begin. \"It's important to face up to nations that discriminate against minorities, sexual or otherwise,\" he says. \"I'm fine with the fact that my story will be mentioned in relation to the Games, because the situation in Russia is something that needs to be talked about. I'm curious to see what will happen. I'm sure that some athletes will make a stand\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger is under no illusion that football's attitudes will change overnight. On the day of his interview with the Guardian, the Paris St-Germain defender Alex, a former Chelsea player, insisted that \"god created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Yves\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger says: \"You'll always have those guys, but it's sad that they don't think a little deeper about what they're saying. I feel sorry for them, really\".</p><p>Still, the emphatically positive response by politicians, footballers and fans have left him in an optimistic mood and at ease with himself. \"It's good to know, not just for me but for others who are still playing now, that those at the top have no problem, that they support you. When the chancellor comes out in your favour, you know that it's safe being homosexual in this country, that you won't be discriminated.

record transfer likely to be confirmed this week as TV fuels European football's spending spree","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>At Real Madrid they have already erected a tented scaffold in one of the stands at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, a small stage upon which they hope the football world will focus later this week. Gareth Bale, the Cardiff boy who made good at Tottenham Hotspur, is set to be unveiled as the world's first €100m (£86m) footballer barring an unlikely counter bid from Manchester United. The Spanish economy may be wheezing in recession, but Real are intent upon bucking the trend.</p><p>Even by Real's standards the fee is staggering, considering this is a player who was almost sold by Tottenham Hotspur for next-to-nothing just four years ago and who has played only one season in Europe's elite competition, the Champions League. It is made more extraordinary because the Welsh international is likely never to feature in a World Cup: the ultimate marketing vehicle for the stars of the game – and their clubs.</p><p>But Real Madrid have been wooed by his recent consistent brilliance at White Hart Lane with the 24-year-old duly named both footballer of the year and young footballer of the year by his fellow professionals in April, having finished last season with 31 goals in all competitions. His move would eclipse the £80m paid by Real to take Ronaldo from Manchester United in 2009.</p><p>Completion of the transfer would be the high water mark of an unprecedented summer of spending across elite European football, as competing oligarchs buoyed by the soaring value of TV deals have lifted spending power across the continent's biggest clubs.</p><p>The Premier League may be about to lose one of its leading lights, but English top flight clubs have still forked out over £460m on players in the current transfer window. That figure will expand further ahead of next Monday's 11pm deadline for deals to be done, and should break the previous record of around £500m, established in 2008, for a single window's business.</p><p>A new £5.5bn television deal guarantees the Premier League's bottom club £63m – more than the champions, Manchester United, earned from the broadcasting pot last season. There is more money pouring into the top division than ever before and that is reflected in transfer fees that are often an expression of power in the game.</p><p>\"Football reflects life, albeit with a ball, so the rich just keep getting richer,\" said Jon Smith, co-founder of the leading First Artist Management agency. \"The rich clubs spend because they can.\"</p><p>Manchester City have spent a little under £100m almost unnoticed. Tottenham, even with Bale on his way out, have broken their own transfer record twice. Chelsea can sign a £30m player, in the Brazilian Willian, almost on a whim. And yet what makes this summer all the more unique is that, where Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, the Glazer family's Manchester United or even City under the Abu Dhabi United group used to splash the cash most extravagantly, alongside Barcelona and Real, now many more clubs across Europe have emerged to join the frenzy.</p><p>French champions Paris St Germain are under Qatari ownership and were able to pay £55m for Edinson Cavani, a Uruguayan forward previously at Napoli who had been courted by English clubs. AS Monaco, bankrolled by the Russian Dmitry Rybolovlev, only returned to the French first division at the end of last season but have spent over €150m in the hope of mustering an immediate title challenge. They beat sides at the top of the Premier League to buy Atlético Madrid's Colombian forward, Radamel Falcao, who cost an eye-catching £53m.</p><p>Germany's Bundesliga, which provided both finalists in last season's Champions League, has also benefitted from its own new broadcasting deal to emerge as a financial and footballing power. Bayern Munich, the reigning European champions, are now under the stewardship of Pep Guardiola – world football's most coveted coach – and were able to entice Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona earlier this summer just as Manchester United were preparing to announce the signing of the midfielder.</p><p>Barcelona took the brilliant Brazil striker Neymar from Santos for €50m to refresh their forward line. If suggestions the Catalan club have already recouped a large proportion of that fee in sales of Neymar's number 11 shirt seem far-fetched, they can at least expect to make a large chunk of that money back in global marketing monies alone. Indeed, all these mind-boggling deals were completed in a summer when Uefa's newly imposed Financial Fair Play rules were supposed to be taking effect, with clubs supposedly restricted to living within their means.</p><p>\"I just hope Uefa make sure it's Financial Fair Play for all, and not just those clubs who have the ability to sell their training ground more than once,\" said Smith.</p><p>That was said with tongue in cheek but reflects the potential loopholes in the Uefa president Michel Platini's plans for regulation. Real's pursuit of Bale has already drawn stinging criticism from the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p><p>\"It makes a joke of the FFP regulations,\" he said. \"I find it amazing that in the year the regulations come in, world football has gone completely crazy.\"</p><p>And yet Real consider the £86m arrival of a stellar player a means of reimposing their authority. The president, Florentino Perez, has personally driven the club's galactico culture for high-value players and was anxious to start his fourth term with a bang. An egotist and a populist, Perez is a figure who enjoys the summer months far more than the season itself because he can't control everything that happens out on the pitch. Real, who set the benchmark with the arrivals of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo, are about to establish a new world record fee. Football's spending has never been more lavish.</p><h2>Record signings<br /></h2><p><strong>1893 Willie Groves </strong>West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa

Instead they are regularly \"condemned to a weekly pattern of expensive parking and endless traffic jams.\"</p><p></p><p>The government is urged to take the lead by setting up free public transport with match tickets – along the lines of the popular and well-used KombiTicket in Germany – and individual clubs should routinely publish travel plans that include proposals for new facilities to improve access by walking and cycling as well as clear information about getting to the ground without a car. Transport operators should investigate a national football supporters' railcard with more flexible conditions, the report recommends.</p><p></p><p>Manchester United's Old Trafford ground comes 18th in the survey of 20 Premier League clubs and is described as \"a major ground served mainly by low-capacity public transport, travel planning nearly a decade out of date and without safe walking or cycling routes.\"</p><p></p><p>Bottom of the pile is Reading's Madejski stadium: \"comfortably the least accessible ground in this year's Premier League – out of town and virtually unreachable by regular public transport.\" And languishing at 19th is Queen's Park Rangers' ground, Loftus Road, where \"despite London's extensive public transport, QPR have no coherent travel plan and offer poor information on how to get to Loftus Road</p><p></p><p>Fans of Arsenal, in second place in the survey, make full use of good public transport links at the club's Emirates stadium, where the percentage of fans arriving by car has been reduced from 30% to 10% since moving from their old ground. And in third place, improvements to Fulham's Craven Cottage have led to a high proportion of supporters combining public transport with walking to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Other key findings from the fans' survey include: 23% of fans spend more on travel than they do on a match ticket; fans travelling by train spend the most followed by lone drivers (most fans share lifts to games), with those travelling by bus spending the least; the average fan spends £55 on a match day with £13 going on travel, while train travellers spend £74, with £26 of this spent getting to the game.</p><p></p><p>Malcolm Clark, chair of the Football Supporters' Federation said: \"Football's loyal supporters deserve more help to leave their cars at home and enjoy the day without hassle.</p><p></p><p>\"Making matchday travel more convenient, pleasant and affordable would benefit everyone involved in football, and we hope to see these ideas employed more widely in future.\"</p>","headline":"Newcastle United tops survey of matchday travel among football fans","trailText":"North-east club clear champions in provision of transport options while Manchester United

It was Tuesday, the day before the Bundesliga leaders took on Arsenal, but he was talking as if it was a <em>fait accompli</em> and, in hindsight, tempting fate more than he realised. \"It is a surprise to have no English teams in the quarter-finals,\" he said. \"They have a strong league and have gone far in the past, so it's a big surprise.\"</p><p>What happened the following night very nearly caught him out. Jens Lehmann summed it up when he talked of the \"arrogance\" in Germany approaching the match. It was, he explained, not considered an important game. \"In their minds, they are already through.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Lahm was right, even if the occasion did threaten to become an ordeal for the four-time winners. Arsenal came up short, while Manchester United will be another envious onlooker when the draw is made, and Manchester City and Chelsea have been excluded since the group phase. It is the first time since Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96 – when only the champions qualified for the tournament – that the Premier League has not had a side in the last eight.</p><p>Plainly, it represents decline, or at least evidence of decline, bearing in mind that in the last eight finals, the Premier League has provided eight representatives, three winners and one all-English affair. Whether that decline amounts to complacency, or a crisis in the making, is another matter entirely, bearing in mind it's only 10 months since Chelsea were parading the trophy through west London – and, certainly, there are plenty of serious football people who consider it too early for snap judgements.</p><p>Roberto Mancini talked recently of English football being considerably superior to its Italian counterpart. Rafael Benítez believes it is \"not an issue\" and \"the wheel will turn again.\" Jose Mourinho says the same. Sir Alex Ferguson will forever be convinced United would have made it past Real Madrid were it not for a red-card decision.</p><p>Arsène Wenger, however, is not usually one for alarmist statements, so it is worth listening when he says it represents \"a massive wake-up call\". England have had 33 quarter-finalists since 1996, compared to Spain's 32, Italy's 24,  Germany's 20 and France's 11, so not to have a single representative this year deserves scrutiny, at the very least.</p><p>Wenger's conclusion is that \"the rest of Europe has caught back up with us\" and he may have a point, bearing in mind the four English teams won only 39% of their games – again, their worst statistic since Blackburn 17 years ago.</p><p>Between them, they managed considerably fewer shots at goal, 269, than their opponents, 345. City had 56 compared to 92. Arsenal's figures were 48 against 93. The four teams conceded more goals per game, 1.39, than any season since 1998-99. Put it all together, and it clearly raises questions about whether the Premier League is quite as accomplished as it likes to portray itself.</p><p>A better time, perhaps, to assess that accurately will be in the next couple of years, when we will know whether this season was simply a one-off or part of a more serious downward trend. Yet it is not knee-jerk to wonder if there are areas of English football that are deteriorating, or at least need fine-tuning.</p><p>Defending, as a whole, has been pretty poor in the Premier League this season. The standard of goalkeeping has regressed (just try to name three goalkeepers who have consistently excelled). Of last season's top four, Arsenal, Chelsea and City have all slipped backward to some degree.</p><p>Other issues have to be factored in. English teams would clearly be refreshed by a winter break, but the top managers have all but given up on calling for it. In Spain, they will rearrange the fixture schedule to help their teams succeed in Europe. In England, that is unheard of. Then there is the speed at which the Premier League is played – 20% faster than five years ago, according to Prozone – when playing in Europe tends to require greater control and discipline and is generally a different tempo, quick bursts of incisive passing, but more structured and conservative beforehand.</p><p>City are the case in point, with only three wins in 12 attempts in the Champions League over the past two seasons. Two were against a Villarreal side that would eventually be relegated, the other against a Bayern team that had already qualified and fielded a virtual reserve team. This season there were no wins in six, albeit in a treacherous group involving the champions of Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>All the same, it is probably too early to make rushed judgements. Wenger made some valid points without actually identifying what had gone wrong, and it is also worth pointing out Arsenal's manager had argued in November there was no reason to be unduly concerned. \"Maybe we have less room, less margin, than we had before, when it was just a question of when we would qualify. German football has come up, Spanish football is there every year and some French clubs have come back, like Paris Saint-Germain. It looks less obvious for us. But I don't think we are getting worse.\"</p><p>Jupp Heynckes, Bayern's manager, was correct, too, when he said it might not even be a debate but for one of the more contentious refereeing decisions at Old Trafford in recent years. \"For United, what can you say?\" Heynckes said, reflecting on Nani's red card against Madrid. \"They had a referee decision that put them at a great disadvantage. When matches are really tight in the Champions League, you have to start and end with 11 players. A decision like that can completely change a match.\"</p><p>There are other mitigating factors, according to Mourinho. \"Man City are out because the draw had something strange – [Borussia] Dortmund, Real Madrid and Man City,\" Madrid's manager says. \"Chelsea were also in a difficult group (Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Nordsjaelland).\"</p><p>Mourinho's view is that there is nothing greatly for English football to be concerned about. All four of the Spanish clubs, he points out, were struggling to qualify. \"If the four Spanish teams are out, it doesn't mean that Spanish football is collapsing. It is football, it can happen.\"</p><p>As it turned out, Madrid, Barcelona and Malaga went through, and Spain have three quarter-finalists for the first time in 10 years. England managed that in three successive seasons from 2007 to 2009. Extend that period back to 2005, there was an English finalist in the Champions League every year. Since then, there have been only two English teams to get as far as the semi-finals – Chelsea last season, United the year before.</p><p>\"A lot of teams have caught up,\" Lahm says. \"We are here. Dortmund are here.\" He agrees, however, with Heynkes about what happened to United against Madrid. \"They didn't have any luck in the draw. And they had only 10 players on the pitch. It could be very different.\"</p><p>Heynckes believes it is evidence that football is cyclical. \"The English teams were strong. Now there are Bundesliga teams. There are always changes. That livens up the Champions League.\"</p><p>Benítez agrees. \"I still see English clubs with a lot of potential who can do really well in Europe. I'm sure the wheel will turn again. Real Madrid and Barcelona are very strong. Italy have had some problems, but Juventus are very strong. To have two or three English teams in the semis or finals is not easy because of the size of the other teams. But I don't see a big problem. It's just one year. The next years may be different.\"</p><p>In the meantime, David Beckham, one suspects, will enjoy being the last Englishman standing. Three sides from Spain, two from Germany and one each from Italy, Turkey and France have made it. The draw is on Friday, when Uefa will map out the route to 25 May at Wembley. English football will have its nose pressed to the window outside.</p><p><em>This article has been amended since first publication</em></p>","headline":"Champions League failure is not a reason for English clubs to panic, yet","trailText":"<strong>Daniel Taylor:</strong> A Premier League club is not in the draw for the last eight for the first time in 17 years, but what does it mean for English football?","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/3/14/1363268144927/Arsenal-Champions-League-003.jpg","wordcount":"1340","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-21T13:43:45Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","tags":[{"id":"football/championsleague","webTitle":"Champions League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/championsleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/500"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.
