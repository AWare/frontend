He tethered a bomb-like device to her neck along with a ransom note and then slipped away. It took a bomb squad 10 hours to remove the device, which contained no explosives.</p><p>Peters, 52, failed to convince the judge his crime was the result of a psychological meltdown sparked by the breakdown of his marriage and a failing career. Instead, the judge said, the once-successful businessman and father of three had shown no remorse, lied to police and was largely motivated by money.</p><p>\"The offender intended to place the very young victim in fear that she would be killed,\" New South Wales state district  court judge Peter Zahra said. \"The terror instilled can only be described as unimaginable.\"</p><p>Pulver hugged relatives after the sentence was read. Her father, Bill Pulver, wiped away tears.</p><p>\"I'm pleased at today's outcome and that I can now look to a future without Paul Peters' name being linked to mine,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/20/australian-fake-bomber-sentenced-sydney-teenager-video\">Madeleine Pulver said outside court</a>. </p><p>\"For me, it was never about the sentencing, but to know that he will not re-offend. And it was good to hear the judge acknowledge the trauma he has put my family and me through.\"</p><p>Zahra gave Peters less than the maximum sentence of 20 years, acknowledging he had pleaded guilty and was likely depressed at the time.</p><p>After attaching the device to the teen, Peters fled to the US, but police used an email address he left on the ransom note to track him down. Authorities arrested him two weeks later at his ex-wife's home in Louisville, Kentucky, and extradited him to Australia. He pleaded guilty in March to aggravated break and enter and committing a serious indictable offense.</p><p>Defence lawyers had argued that Peters was depressed, drinking heavily and exhibiting wild mood swings before committing the crime and had no memory of the attack. He had recently split from his wife, was separated from his children and had become obsessed with a book he was writing about a villain out for revenge, his lawyer, Tim Game, said during earlier sentencing hearings.</p><p>A psychiatrist for the defence testified that Peters may have tried to become the evil protagonist in his book. Peters told the psychiatrist: \"It's not about money, it's about revenge.\"</p><p>But prosecutors disagreed. During an earlier hearing, prosecutor Margaret Cunneen said Pulver was never the intended target of Peters's crime. The investment banker was having financial problems and originally travelled to Mosman, the wealthy Sydney suburb where the Pulvers live, to hunt down the beneficiary of a multimillion-dollar trust fund he had learned about, she said. When he arrived in Mosman, he bumped into a neighbour of the Pulvers, whom he had met while doing business in Hong Kong. That man, who lived next door to the Pulvers, then became Peters's new target, Cunneen said.</p><p>But on the day of the attack, Peters walked into the wrong house. Madeleine Pulver was the unwitting victim of Peters's incompetence, the prosecutor said.</p><p>Embarrassed by his bungled extortion bid, Peters concocted a story about being delusional and not remembering the crime to save face, Cunneen said.</p><p>The judge largely agreed with the prosecution's version of events, saying the attack was precise and premeditated, and dismissed the defence's arguments that Peters was delusional and in a psychotic state during the crime. Zahra did accept that Peters was likely depressed, but said it did not explain or excuse his behaviour.</p><p>Peters, who will be eligible for parole in 10 years, cried in court when the judge detailed the problems the banker had been facing with his marriage and his career. He showed no emotion when the judge described the trauma Madeleine endured as a result of the attack.</p><p>\"Mr Peters has actually, from our perspective, shown no clear remorse for this entire event,\" Pulver said outside court. \"There has still been no apology nor any explanation for his behaviour, which is disappointing. But the man was just told he was going to be in jail for 10 years, so he has reason to be upset.\"</p>","headline":"Australian 'collar-bomb' man jailed for attack on Sydney schoolgirl","trailText":"<p>Paul Peters, an investment banker, sentenced to 13 years in prison after attaching a fake collar bomb to Madeleine Pulver</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/4/1312443893073/Madeleine-Pulver-who-spen-002.jpg","wordcount":"722","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"399676718","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press in Sydney","internalPageCode":"1831141","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-23T03:59:35Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/australia-collar-bomb-man-jailed","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/20/australia-collar-bomb-man-jailed","tags":[{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/texas","webTitle":"Texas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/texas","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/texas","references":[]},{"id":"world/sydney","webTitle":"Sydney","description":"Latest news and comment on Sydney","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sydney","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/sydney","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-399726817","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/4/1312443893073/Madeleine-Pulver-who-spen-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Supplied","altText":"Madeleine Pulver, who spent 10 hours with fake bomb attached to her neck in an extortion plot","height":"84","credit":"Supplied/EPA","caption":"Madeleine Pulver, who spent 10 hours with fake bomb attached to her neck in an extortion plot.

Nearby homes were evacuated and streets cleared. The teenager told police a man wearing a mask broke into her home and confronted her while she was in the kitchen. The man forced her to stay still while he fitted the device to her neck, before fleeing the house.</p><p>Moore said police were trying to establish how the man got into the house. \"We are treating this as an individual incident,\" he said. \"We have absolutely no information to suggest this is linked to any other crime.\"</p><p>New South Wales police's assistant commissioner, Mark Murdoch, said the device was sophisticated and was designed to look like a bomb as part of a \"very, very elaborate hoax\".</p><p>Australia's prime minister, Julia Gillard, said she was shocked when she heard about the case. \"When I looked at it this morning, the first thing I said was, 'It's like a Hollywood script – the kind of thing you would see at the cinema or on TV',\" she told Fairfax

   </video><p>An FBI Swat team descended on a quiet Louisville suburb to arrest a man who authorities say broke into a family's home in Australia and chained a fake bomb to a teenage woman's neck as part of an extortion ploy.</p><p>Paul \"Doug\" Peters, 50, faces charges in Australia that include kidnapping and breaking and entering, said Luke Moore of the New South Wales police. Peters' initial court appearance was set for Tuesday morning in Louisville and the extradition process will take about two months, authorities said.</p><p>His capture comes nearly two weeks after 18-year-old Madeleine Pulver was attacked in the wealthy Sydney suburb of Mosman. She was alone studying for exams when a masked man broke into the house in the middle of the day, chained a device that looked like a bomb to her and left a note with demands before leaving.</p><p>Bomb technicians, negotiators and detectives rushed to the scene.<br />Neighbouring homes were evacuated, streets were closed and medical and fire crews waited nearby. Pulver spent 10 terrifying hours chained to the device before the bomb squad was able to free her. She was not hurt, and the device was later found to contain no explosives.<br />Australia's prime minister said the event resembled \"a Hollywood script\".<br />Police say a note had been attached to the device, but they haven't released details of what it said.</p><p>Moore flew from Sydney to Louisville for the arrest, but would not go into detail about what led police to Peters.</p><p>\"There was a range of pieces of evidence that led us to identify this suspect,\" he said at a news conference at FBI offices in Louisville.<br />Peters is an Australian citizen but has lived in the US, including Kentucky.<br />The Pulvers were relieved to hear of the arrest. William Pulver, CEO<br />of an information technology company, described his daughter as \"a<br />bright, happy young woman who for reasons we still don't understand had her life turned upside down going through this dreadful experience\".<br />\"These past two weeks have been a very difficult time for us and we are hopeful that this development marks the beginning of the end of this traumatic ordeal for our family,\" William Pulver told reporters in Sydney, his wife Belinda at his side.</p><p>The normally tranquil subdivision of La Grange, about 30 miles (50<br />km) north-east of Louisville, was taken aback at the sight of<br />armed Swat members descending on their neighbourhood.<br />A neighbour, who refused to give his name, told The Associated Press that his two daughters were at home doing homework when the Swat team \"came in heavy and hard\" to the house next door.</p><p>\"We had guys with machine guns in our back yard,\" he said, adding that no shots were fired and no sirens sounded.</p><p>He and his wife estimated that Doug Peters had probably spent about six months out of the past two years at the house. They didn't know him or his ex-wife very well but that there were no problems and they were both congenial. Peters had been involved in various businesses, but authorities would not elaborate on what they were.</p><p>An FBI investigator combed through items on shelves Monday night in the neat three-car garage of the five-bedroom, two-story home that's on the market for $400,000, and there is no indication Peters' ex-wife was involved in the case, Moore said. She was not home when her ex-husband was arrested.</p><p>Authorities are still investigating why the suspect targeted the young woman, Moore said.</p><p>\"This has been a baffling and frightening experience,\" said William Pulver. \"It has tested us all.\"</p>","headline":"Australian police arrest man in US over fake 'collar bomb'","trailText":"<p>Businessman arrested two weeks after Madeleine Pulver had device attached to her neck for 10 hours in Sydney</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/16/1313454494434/Police-investigate-collar-003.jpg","wordcount":"576","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"377935832","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5073162","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press","internalPageCode":"1620412","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-08-19T00:29:38Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/16/australian-police-arrest-fake-collar-bomb","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/16/australian-police-arrest-fake-collar-bomb","tags":[{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/kentucky","webTitle":"Kentucky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kentucky","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kentucky","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"world/sydney","webTitle":"Sydney","description":"Latest news and comment on Sydney","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sydney","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/sydney","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-377946960","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/16/1313454494434/Police-investigate-collar-003.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Rick Rycroft","altText":"Police investigate 'collar bomb' alert in Sydney","height":"84","credit":"Rick Rycroft/AP","caption":"Police outside the house of Madeleine Pulver on 4 August.
