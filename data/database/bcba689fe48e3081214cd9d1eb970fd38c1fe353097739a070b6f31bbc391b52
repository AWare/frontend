February 2016. The flow of refugees and migrants from the port of Piraeus to the borders of Greece with FYROM is carried out with delay due to transport blockades by striking Greek farmers. Hundreds of migrants, but anyway less than the previous period, continue to arrive on the Greek islands, after having crossed the Aegean sea, on their way to the European Union countries.
