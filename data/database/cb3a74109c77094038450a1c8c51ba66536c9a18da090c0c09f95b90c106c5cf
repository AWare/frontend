In the hours before his race at London 2012, one commentary published in China Daily said: \"The nation has been waiting four years to hear the Olympic starting gun for the star hurdler Liu Xiang.\"</p><p>However, now 29, Liu, had arrived at the Olympics amid speculation that he was carrying injuries, despite showing some impressive form in elite events this year. Liu's coach had expressed concern about his recurrent foot injury in the last few days in widely reported remarks, leading many to conclude his prospects of reclaiming his title were poor.</p><p>Wearing heavy strapping on his right achilles, Liu rose from the blocks in his opening heat, but hit his first hurdle and fell to the ground. He stood up and hopped on his left leg back towards the start, then turned around and tottered all the way down the straight.</p><p>Some of the commentators on Chinese state television were unable to control their tears. The subject immediately dominated domestic microblogs, with around 20m mentions of a \"Liu crashed\" hashtag within half an hour of his tumble. \"Liu fell to the ground. So did the hearts of 1.3 billion people,\" wrote one user. Some dubbed him \"Liu Shuai Shuai\" (\"Liu Fell Fell\") and spoke harshly of his failure.</p><p>One cynical microblogger wrote: \"Liu is the best actor in the world.\" But most showed their sympathy, with one user writing: \"Anyway, you were already the champion when you made it to the field.\" Another scolded the critics, writing: \"Maybe there is a low point for everyone. It would be to heartless to satirize or mock Liu. Let's pray for him!\"</p><p><em>Additional research by Kathy Gao</em></p>","headline":"Liu Xiang pulls up in opening race at second consecutive Olympics","trailText":"Liu Xiang, China's accident-prone poster boy at the 2008 Games, has again failed to reach his first hurdle in his 110m hurdles heat","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344334842118/Liu-Xiang--003.jpg","wordcount":"389","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394296766","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6513579","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tania Branigan and James Callow","internalPageCode":"1784311","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-10T10:22:28Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/liu-xiang-injured-olympics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/aug/07/liu-xiang-injured-olympics","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012-athletics","webTitle":"Olympics 2012: athletics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-athletics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012-athletics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/china-olympic-team","webTitle":"China Olympic team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/china-olympic-team","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/china-olympic-team","references":[]},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/athletics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/china","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/james-callow","webTitle":"James Callow","r2ContributorId":"33780","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>James Callow is a sports journalist for the Guardian and the Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-callow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/james-callow","references":[]},{"id":"profile/taniabranigan","webTitle":"Tania Branigan","rcsId":"GNL004773","r2ContributorId":"16507","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/tania_branigan_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tania Branigan is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China correspondent</a> for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/taniabranigan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/taniabranigan","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-394297037","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344334839435/Liu-Xiang--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Stefan Wermuth","altText":"Liu Xiang ","height":"54","credit":"Stefan Wermuth/Reuters","caption":"China's Liu Xiang holds his leg after suffering an injury during his men's 110m hurdles round one heat.

And pray for rain. Four years ago Nicole Cooke emerged from the drizzle by the Great Wall of China to win the women's cycling road race and give Britain a first medal in the Beijing Games. On Sunday, with rain lashing the Mall, it was the turn of her team mate Lizzie Armitstead, whose silver medal – the first of any colour for the host nation's team at London 2012 – came at the end of a gruelling and aggressively fought 140km race in which the 23-year-old Yorkshirewoman finished less than a length behind the winner.</p><p>If Armitstead gave Britain something to cheer, she also helped assuage the disappointment of Paula Radcliffe, who announced on Sunday that a persistent foot injury will prevent her from competing in next Sunday's women's marathon. Radcliffe tweeted: \"First time I smiled today was watching @L_Armitstead claim silver in the women's road race – well done!\". At 38, after finishing fifth in Sydney 12 years ago and enduring subsequent bitter and very public failures in Athens and Beijing, Britain's greatest marathon runner has forfeited her last chance of an Olympic medal to go with the world record she has held for almost the past 10 years.</p><p>For Armitstead, there was no shame in coming second to Marianne Vos, a 25-year-old Dutch rider who has been the strongest female road cyclist in the world for several years, but whose only previous gold medal in a road race came in the 2006 world championships. The majesty of Vos's performance in the closing stages of the race merely gave Armitstead's medal an extra lustre.</p><p>Two seconds behind the pair came Olga Zabelinskaya of Russia, who had joined them in a decisive break as they came off Box Hill in Surrey for the second and final time, with 40km left to race. A fourth rider in the break, Shelley Olds of the United States, suffered a puncture 30km from the finish, leaving the remaining trio to sort out the medals between them. The rain washed stones and other debris on to the road, ensuring that many riders suffered punctures, while the treacherous surface contributed to several crashes.</p><p>Once again, despite the frequent downpours, the roadsides were filled with spectators, most of them rooting noisily for a British win. The team was completed by Emma Pooley and Lucy Martin, both playing parts in the plan devised by their coach, Chris Newton, an Olympic silver medal winner, to put Armitstead in position to challenge for a place on the podium.</p><p>\"It was quite strange not to be able to hear yourself think,\" Armitstead said of the fervent support. \"You had to concentrate on what your legs were doing and not to get distracted. But it was good to see people out on the course even when the rain really came down.\"</p><p>Being from Otley, West Yorkshire, Armitstead is used to riding in the rain. In fact she prefers it. \"When the heatwave came last week it made most people happy,\" she said. \"I wasn't too pleased about it.\" The roads were still dry half an hour before the race, but thunder cracked over the Mall just as the four British riders were presented to the crowd and it was raining before they had reached the suburbs. \"I was praying for rain,\" Armitstead said. \"A break has more chance of staying clear in those conditions.\"</p><p>Her success also restored some of the colour to the cheeks of Britain's cycling team, which had suffered the disappointment of Mark Cavendish's failure to make an impact on the men's road race over the same course 24 hours earlier. She and her team-mates had watched that race and had noted the course gave a small group of escapers a chance of staying clear of the rest of the field. The factor that had done for Cavendish was turned to her advantage. \"We saw that once a committed group went, it was hard to chase from behind,\" she said.</p><p>Like Cavendish and the members of the successful track team, Armitstead is a product of British Cycling's development programme, whose representatives spotted her during a visit to her school eight years ago. \"I was into all kinds of sport,\" she said. \"A lot of my family are involved in rugby league and I was the girl who was in every school team, even the football team, keeping goal. But I wasn't fantastic at anything until cycling came along.\"</p><p>She won a gold medal with Britain's team pursuit squad at the 2009 world championships in Melbourne but has since concentrated on the road events. Last year she was among the favourites for the world championship road race in Copenhagen, but after finishing seventh she criticised Cooke for riding selfishly, leading to an exchange of views in the media. On Sunday they appeared at ease as they started the race alongside each other, although Cooke was never a factor and finished 31st, half a minute after the medal winners. \"The differences we had are behind us,\" Armitstead said. \"I was confident when we lined up today that we were a united team.\"</p><p>The women's race was contested by 66 riders, less than half the size of the men's field, revealing the imbalance in the status either side of the gender divide in an increasingly popular sport. Women's road racing has virtually no television coverage outside of the Olympics and the world championships, which means sponsors are hard to find and tend not to stay long. The women's Tour de France is no longer held, and other important races have been lost. Britain's Team Sky, which was launched three years ago with a pledge to field a women's team alongside the star-studded and now Tour de France-winning men, has yet to do so, although British Cycling gives equal treatment to all riders in its Olympic programme.</p><p>Pat McQuaid, the president of the UCI, international cycling's governing body, shook hands with Armitstead and the other leading riders on the start line, and later offered his congratulations on the podium. \"It was difficult,\" she said. \"It was a moment when you wanted to say, 'Let's sit down and have a conversation'. There are a lot of things that could be done, and I think we could get more help from the top. But at the moment there's not much I can do to change things. After my career, I hope to.\"</p>","headline":"Silver medal joy for British cyclist Lizzie Armitstead in Olympic road race","trailText":"<p>Yorkshire rider comes second in event won by Nicole Cooke in Beijing in 2008 to take first medal for GB in 2012</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/cartoons/2012/7/29/1343594605113/Olympics-Day-2---Cycling--003.jpg","wordcount":"1076","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"393801023","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6478339","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Richard Williams","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-07-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1780430","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-01T20:45:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/lizzie-armitstead-silver-medal-road-race","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jul/29/lizzie-armitstead-silver-medal-road-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012-cycling","webTitle":"Olympics 2012: cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012-cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/nicolecooke","webTitle":"Nicole Cooke","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nicolecooke","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/nicolecooke","references":[]},{"id":"sport/paularadcliffe","webTitle":"Paula Radcliffe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paularadcliffe","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/paularadcliffe","references":[]},{"id":"sport/emmapooley","webTitle":"Emma Pooley","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/emmapooley","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/emmapooley","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/richardwilliams","webTitle":"Richard Williams","rcsId":"GNL042351","r2ContributorId":"16336","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749338779/RichardWilliams.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733747256/RichardWilliams.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Richard Williams is a former chief sports writer for the Guardian.

record holder walked to his starting block for his first heat with a slight limp and then false-started before hobbling away, his Games over.</p><p>The departure of the athlete, who had become a national hero when he won the 110m hurdles in Athens – becoming the first Asian man to take gold in an Olympics track event – shocked and disappointed his compatriots at their home Games, prompting both sympathy and conspiracy theories. In the hours before his race at London 2012, one commentary published in China Daily said: \"The nation has been waiting four years to hear the Olympic starting gun for the star hurdler Liu Xiang.\"</p><p>However, now 29, Liu, had arrived at the Olympics amid speculation that he was carrying injuries, despite showing some impressive form in elite events this year. Liu's coach had expressed concern about his recurrent foot injury in the last few days in widely reported remarks, leading many to conclude his prospects of reclaiming his title were poor.</p><p>Wearing heavy strapping on his right achilles, Liu rose from the blocks in his opening heat, but hit his first hurdle and fell to the ground. He stood up and hopped on his left leg back towards the start, then turned around and tottered all the way down the straight.</p><p>Some of the commentators on Chinese state television were unable to control their tears. The subject immediately dominated domestic microblogs, with around 20m mentions of a \"Liu crashed\" hashtag within half an hour of his tumble. \"Liu fell to the ground. So did the hearts of 1.3 billion people,\" wrote one user. Some dubbed him \"Liu Shuai Shuai\" (\"Liu Fell Fell\") and spoke harshly of his failure.</p><p>One cynical microblogger wrote: \"Liu is the best actor in the world.\" But most showed their sympathy, with one user writing: \"Anyway, you were already the champion when you made it to the field.\" Another scolded the critics, writing: \"Maybe there is a low point for everyone. It would be to heartless to satirize or mock Liu.
