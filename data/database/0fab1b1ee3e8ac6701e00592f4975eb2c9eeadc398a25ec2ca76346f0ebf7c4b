The currency probe comes as regulators are still investigating the manipulation of the Libor lending rate by traders at some of the world’s biggest banks.</p><p>Reuters revealed on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank had fired three New York-based currency traders amid signs of a widening investigation. \"Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory authorities that are investigating trading in the foreign exchange market,\" a bank spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \"The bank is co-operating with those investigations, and will take disciplinary action with regards to individuals if merited.\"</p><p>On Wednesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs’ Steven Cho, formerly global head of spot and forward foreign exchange trading for major currencies, was retiring from the bank. His departure came a day after Citigroup announced that Anil Prasad, its global head of foreign exchange, was leaving the company. It is not know if his retirement is in any way linked to any investigation.</p><p>Citigroup, JP Morgan and others have confirmed they are co-operating with investigations. </p><p>A Citi source told Reuters that the departure of Prasad, who was based in London, was unrelated to any ongoing currency market investigation. </p><p>Prasad’s exit comes a month after Rohan Ramchandani, formerly Citi’s head of European spot foreign exchange trading, was fired. Ramchandani had been a member of the Bank of England’s foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for discussing market issues. The reasons for his dismissal were unknown.</p><p>Lawsky is one of the world’s most powerful regulators and has authority over financial institutions chartered in New York state, including many non-US banks that do business in the country.</p><p>Appointed in 2011, Lawsky rose to prominence after accusing Standard Chartered of orchestrating an illegal money-laundering operation, and threatening to revoke its New York banking licence. News of the investigation triggered a 23% drop in Standard Chartered’s share price and ended with the bank paying a $340m fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services.</p><p>Lawsky’s probe into the FX markets is not the only one under way. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US Department of Justice are also conducting investigations. Swiss regulators are also looking at the markets, and are thought to be focusing on the “fix” – a figure used to price a number of financial products such as funds for private investors.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/financial-conduct-authority-libor-abuse-market-rates-london\">FCA chief Martin Wheatley said this week </a>that he was examining possible abuse of London-based market rates. Wheatley and others continue to examine the Libor interest rate scandal that has led to billions of dollars in fines for banks including Barclays and UBS. \"The allegations are every bit as bad as they have been with Libor. Given what has come out, no, people won't trust the way rates are fixed,\" Wheatley told a Treasury select committee this week.</p><p>Lloyds Banking Group is believed to have been contacted. RBS declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank. Standard Chartered could not immediately be reached. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.</p>","headline":"New York regulator demands bank documents as investigation widens","trailText":"Goldman Sachs and Barclays among banks investigated after reports some traders shared information about currency positions ","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfzx","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391627363789/71c78575-0f79-4388-8476-9db30ea10670-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391627363789/71c78575-0f79-4388-8476-9db30ea10670-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"625","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429004651","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f289f2e4b0ab978b0f96d0","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dominic Rushe in New York and Jill Treanor in London","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038933","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T14:15:20-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/05/new-york-regulator-banks-trading-investigation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/05/new-york-regulator-banks-trading-investigation","tags":[{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking","references":[]},{"id":"business/banking-reform","webTitle":"Banking reform","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking-reform","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking-reform","references":[]},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/currencies","references":[]},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

President Vladimir Putin has spoken of the Games as a personal project to show the world Russia's greatness and its ability to host such major events, but the build-up has been marred by controversy over corruption and rights abuses in Russia.</p><p>The open letter to Russia condemns the  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda\" title=\"\">recently passed gay propaganda and blasphemy laws</a>, which respectively prohibit the \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\" among minors and criminalise religious insult, as well as the recent recriminalisation of defamation. The three laws \"specifically put writers at risk\", say the authors, and they \"cannot stand quietly by as we watch our fellow writers and journalists pressed into silence or risking prosecution and often drastic punishment for the mere act of communicating their thoughts\".</p><p>Grass is joined as a signatory by three fellow Nobel laureates, Wole Soyinka, Elfriede Jelinek and Orhan Pamuk, and by acclaimed writers from over 30 countries, including Ariel Dorfman, Carol Ann Duffy, Edward Albee, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan and Neil Gaiman. Russia's foremost contemporary novelist, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, is also a signatory to the letter.</p><p>Rushdie described the campaign as essential, telling the Guardian that it is \"incredibly important to Russian writers, artists and citizens alike\".</p><p>\"The chokehold that the Russian Federation has placed on freedom of expression is deeply worrying and needs to be addressed in order to bring about a healthy democracy in Russia,\" said the Booker prize-winning novelist, author of Midnight's Children and The Satanic Verses.</p><p>Gaiman said: \"I believe that free expression – freedom of speech, freedom to write, to argue, to disagree – is the most important freedom we have as human beings. I hate to see that being stifled in Russia. The solution to speech and writing that offends you is to speak and write about it in your turn, not to criminalise it or to try and eradicate it.</p><p>\"Criminalising those who write positively about gay people and gay themes, or who write negatively about the church, criminalising defamation, these are all things that clamp down on the exchange of ideas, that push dissent and stories underground. I hope that Mr Putin reads the open letter; I hope he changes course.\"</p><p>Ulitskaya, the first woman to win the Russian equivalent of the Booker, said that Russian authorities were attempting to impose \"a cultural ideology that, in many respects, mimics the style of Soviet-era propaganda\".</p><p>\"Like many Russian citizens, I am deeply concerned about the increasing restrictions on freedom of speech in my country, about the ever-expanding legislation and arbitrary bureaucracy that affect all aspects of Russian life,\" she said. \"I am frightened by the judicial system's increasing dependence on these very authorities. Because of this, I signed PEN International's open letter to the Russia authorities protesting their increasingly regressive approach to freedom of expression.\"The tension is not only being felt in the literary world. In the past week, the only independent source of television news in Russia, cable station TV Rain, has been cut off from its viewers, after all the main cable providers dropped it from their broadcasts.</p><p>The ostensible reason is offence caused after a poll on the channel's website about whether the Soviets should have given up Leningrad during the second world war, but editors say cable companies have admitted in private that they acted after receiving phone calls from the presidential administration.</p><p>In another sign that the already squeezed media landscape is set to narrow further, the leading state news agency RIA Novosti, which was known for its relatively impartial coverage of events in Russia, has also been \"liquidated\" according to Kremlin decree, in changes that will fully come into effect after it has finished covering the Olympics.</p><p>The gay law in particular has caused international outcry. Putin claimed last month that it was not discriminatory, but aimed at protecting Russian children from dangerous information about homosexuality and paedophilia. He said gay people were welcome to visit Sochi as long as they \"leave children alone\".</p><p>The gay advocacy group All Out organised protests against the law in 19 cities worldwide on Wednesday, and has also released a list of athletes, including 12 who will compete at these Olympics, who are calling on Russia to change the law. However, the athletes are under pressure from the International Olympic Committee not to make any statements deemed as \"political\" during the Games, and so many are treading carefully.</p><p>The 217 authors who signed the open letter are urging the Russian authorities to repeal these laws, which they say \"strangle free speech\".</p><p>They also want Russia to recognise its obligation under the international covenant on civil and political rights \"to respect freedom of opinion, expression and belief – including the right not to believe – and to commit itself to creating an environment in which all citizens can experience the benefit of the free exchange of opinion\". The letter adds: \"A healthy democracy must hear the independent voices of all its citizens; the global community needs to hear, and be enriched by, the diversity of Russian opinion.\"</p><p>Other signatories include Jeffrey Eugenides, Ali Smith, Jostein Gaarder, the author of Sophie's World, Chinese novelist Ma Jian and the Turkish writer Elif Safak.</p><p>The letter is part of PEN <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/sochi-winter-olympics-campaign-out-in-the-cold/\" title=\"\">International's worldwide campaign</a> to highlight what it calls \"the draconian restrictions placed on free expression\" in Russia since Vladimir Putin returned to office in May 2012.</p><p>Although the writers' organisation welcomed December's release of 2,000 prisoners –<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/24/pussy-riot-members-reunited-release-russia\" title=\"\"> including two members of Pussy Riot</a> and the Arctic 30 environmental protesters – it said they should never  have been arrested in the first place, and called the amnesty \"part of a politically motivated move to soothe criticism ahead of the Sochi Games during which a huge wave of protest is expected in Russia and beyond in response to Putin's increasingly repressive approach to freedom of expression\".</p><p>Even after the amnesty, other controversial cases have continued. In Moscow on Wednesday, the remaining eight defendants in a lengthy court case against protesters who clashed with police the day before Putin's inauguration in 2012 gave their \"last word\". They are accused of \"causing mass riots\" and face up to six years in prison, in a case that many have seen as politically ordered so as to discourage protests.</p><p>Separately, two environmental activists who have written about abuses in the run-up to the Olympics in Sochi have been arrested this week on what have been called trumped-up charges by Amnesty International.</p>","headline":"Sochi

The report said those who abused and exploited those incarcerated in the laundries run by Irish nuns should be prosecuted if they are still alive.</p><p>It urged that \"full compensation be paid to the victims and their families\" who were caught up in the Magdalene system in Ireland.</p><p>While welcoming statements made by the Holy See delegation expressing a commitment to upholding the rights of children, the committee made clear its \"deepest concern\" about abuse committed by clergy operating \"under the authority of the Holy See\".</p><p>Tens of thousands of children had been abused by clerics worldwide, it said.</p><p>\"The committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators,\" it wrote.</p><p>The report came two weeks after the committee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/un-criticises-vatican-coverups-child-sex-abuse-catholic-priests\" title=\"\">grilled a Vatican delegation</a> over the church's response to abuse allegations.</p><p>In particular, the committee slammed the practice of moving priests found to have abused children from parish to parish or to other countries \"in an attempt to cover up such crimes\". Last month a Vatican delegation in Geneva for questioning by the panel accepted criticisms of this practice and said it no longer went on.</p><p>But the committee nonetheless noted: \"The practice of offenders' mobility, which has allowed many priests to remain in contact with children and to continue to abuse them, still places children in many countries at high risk of sexual abuse, as dozens of child sexual offenders are reported to be still in contact with children.\"</p><p>The UN panel also criticised the Holy See for refusing to hand over data concerning all cases of abuse brought to its attention during the period in question, and their outcomes. It said that confidential disciplinary proceedings had \"allowed the vast majority of abusers and almost all those who concealed child sexual abuse to escape judicial proceedings in states where abuses were committed\".</p><p>It also said the reporting of suspected crimes had been strongly hampered by a \"code of silence\" among the clergy which had seen those who dared to break it \"ostracised, demoted and fired\", and cited one well-known instance from 2001 in which a bishop was in effect congratulated for having kept to it.</p><p>Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society in Britain, said Francis was now under pressure to prove his determination to take action.</p><p>\"Pope Francis has already missed opportunities to assert his authority to reverse the church's damaging policies over clerical abuse and unless he responds positively and quickly to the demands of the committee, he risks history judging his whole papacy a failure,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>\"Lawyers confirm that evidence abounds of the church at all levels continuing, even following the resignation of Pope Benedict, to do everything in its power to shield abusing Catholic clerics from justice and maintain secrecy, and do the least possible for victims,\" he said.</p><p>The Vatican was expected to issue a statement on the findings later on Wednesday.</p>","headline":"UN denounces Vatican over child abuse and demands immediate action","trailText":"Devastating UN report demands Vatican 'immediately remove' all clergy who are known or

In many neighborhoods, the pharmacy serves as the principal convenience store. But campaigners have long argued that selling tobacco in particular is inconsistent with pharmacies' healthcare role.</p><p>Smoking was responsible for more than 480,000 deaths annually from 2005 to 2009, according to the US surgeon general, and is the largest cause of preventable deaths.</p><p>\"Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health,\" said Larry J Merlo, CVS Caremark president and CEO, said in a statement. \"Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose.\"</p><p>CVS said it will also undertake a nationwide smoking cessation program set to be launched in the spring. </p><p>Laws for cigarette sales in the US vary by state and sometimes by city – San Francisco and Boston already ban the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies. </p><p>In recent years, pharmacies like CVS have moved towards providing more healthcare services, such as flu shots and vaccinations.

On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Ethan-Couch-Sentenced-to-Undetermined-Amount-of-Rehab-243829141.html\">district judge Jean Boyd again did not issue any jail time</a> and assigned him to the centre in a court hearing that was closed to the media.</p><p> The sentence handed out by Boyd last year outraged the victims' families and the case attracted national attention after a <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Psychologist-Who-Helped-Teen-Get-Probation-After-5060858.php\">psychologist called by the defence</a> testified that the teenager had \"affluenza\", indicating that his behavioural problems were influenced by a troubled upbringing in a wealthy family where privilege prevented him from grasping the consequences of his actions.</p><p>Critics said the outcome was an egregious example of a justice system that treats the rich and the poor differently.</p><p>A statement from the Tarrant County district attorney's office said that the judge \"ordered the teen be placed in a lock-down residential treatment facility, where he will remain for an undisclosed period. She ordered his parents to pay for the cost of his treatment.\"</p><p>As a condition of his probation, the teen is not allowed to drive and must refrain from any alcohol and drug use, among other things. If he violates any condition of his probation over the next ten years, he could be sentenced to up to ten years behind bars.\"</p><p> Prosecutors had originally asked Boyd to sentence Couch to 20 years' detention, while his lawyers recommended his parents pay for him to seek therapy at a $450,000-a-year rehabilitation facility in California. <br></p><p>Wednesday's hearing was scheduled after prosecutors once more tried to argue he should go to prison, this time as punishment for charges related to the two injured people. <br></p><p> Couch, from Keller, near Fort Worth, admitted four counts of intoxication manslaughter. He was speeding last June when he lost control of his Ford F-350 pick-up truck, swerved off a suburban road and ploughed at up to 70 mph into a group of people who were helping Breanna Mitchell, whose car had broken down.</p><p>Mitchell, a youth pastor named Brian Jennings, Hollie Boyles, and her daughter, Shelby, were killed. <br></p><p>Couch had seven passengers. Two were riding in the bed of the truck and were seriously injured. One is paralysed and unable to speak. The other suffered broken bones and internal injuries. <br></p><p>Lawsuits seeking damages from Couch and his family have been filed by several of the victims' relatives.</p><p>Aged 16 at the time, Couch's blood alcohol level was three times the adult legal limit and there were traces of Valium and other drugs in his system, according to prosecutors, who said the group had stolen beer from a Walmart.</p><p>\"Money always seems to keep [him] out of trouble. Ultimately today, I felt that money did prevail,\" Eric Boyles, husband to Hollie and father of Shelby, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram after the trial.</p><p>The psychologist, G Dick Miller, told CNN he wished he \"hadn't used that term. Everyone seems to have hooked on to it. We used to call these people spoiled brats.\"</p><p>\"Affluenza\" is not a condition recognised by the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined as far back as the 1950s and <a href=\"http://ideas.time.com/2013/12/14/co-author-of-affluenza-im-appalled-by-the-ethan-couch-decision/\">popularised in the late 1990s</a>, when it referred to the stress caused by obsessive consumerism. </p><p> Last month, Mike Gatto, a California assemblyman, <a href=\"http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2014/01/affluenza-defense-would-be-banned-under-mike.html\">proposed a bill banning the \"affluenza defence\"</a> from being used in the state's courts. \"I just think it really is one of those times where unless we're proactive it could become something that's far more common,\" he said. <br></p>","headline":"Texas teenager suffering 'affluenza' avoids jail for second time","trailText":"Ethan Couch, who killed four people while drunk driving, is ordered to attend rehabilitation centre despite anger of victims' families<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgxe","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391656326631/1144325b-4d06-474f-968b-39f5d3f0e698-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391656326631/1144325b-4d06-474f-968b-39f5d3f0e698-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"601","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429026512","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2f877e4b0ab978b0f973d","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Dart in Houston","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039054","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T03:20:18Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-teenager-affluenza-escapes-jail-second-time","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-teenager-affluenza-escapes-jail-second-time","tags":[{"id":"world/texas","webTitle":"Texas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/texas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/texas","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-dart","webTitle":"Tom Dart","r2ContributorId":"50797","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/9/1336571916728/Tom-Dart-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Dart is a Houston-based freelance journalist.

But shares fell sharply as the company announced it had 241m users at the end of 2013, just 9m higher than the previous quarter.</p><p>Twitter also disclosed that the number of “timeline views” – its equivalent of page views, and a key measure for advertisers – dropped for the first time in the last quarter of 2013 to 148bn from 159bn.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/statuses/431176064996372480\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Twitter Engagement: Q4’13 Timeline Views 148 billion, up 26% y/y. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TWTRearnings&amp;src=hash\">#TWTRearnings</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/JMwcymsmZx\">pic.twitter.com/JMwcymsmZx</a></p>&mdash; TwitterIR (@TwitterIR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/statuses/431176064996372480\">February 5, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>The fall came even as Twitter made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to Tweets. The moves were designed to improve “engagement” – a key measure for advertisers who want to people to spend time on a site. </p><p>According to the earnings report issued on Wednesday, in the three months to 31 December, the company had revenues of $242.7m, an increase of 116% compared to $112m in the same period last year. It made a net loss of $511m for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to a net loss of $9m in the same period last year.</p><p>Twitter said it expected first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $230m to $240m, with revenue for the year of between $1.15bn and $1.2bn, nearly double the $665m it posted in 2013.</p><p>\"Twitter finished a great year with our strongest financial quarter to date,\" said Dick Costolo, Twitter's CEO. \"We are the only platform that is public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed, and I'm excited by the number of initiatives we have underway to further build upon the Twitter experience.\"</p><p>In a conference call with analysts Costolo was quizzed about its slowing user numbers. He said the company was “doubling down on accelerating growth in our core user base” in 2014. Twitter has “massive global awareness” he said but needed to make it easier for new people to “get it”.</p><p>Costolo said changes to Twitter’s products had already made significant differences, increasing the numbers of retweets and favourites. “We believe combined changes over the course of the year will start to change the slope of the user growth curve,” he said. He said the company had a clear “roadmap” for growing user numbers. “I’m delighted with the early results,” he said.</p><p>Twitter went public last November and while its share price has soared, it has attracted some unusually negative coverage. Shares sold at $26 a share during the initial public offering and have traded as high as $74.73. They closed Wednesday at $66.21, before the earnings report was published.  In after-hours trading, the stock fell by as much as 17%,</p><p>Before the results were issued, 30% of the analysts following Twitter had posted sell ratings on the company’s stock, while 27% listed it as buys and 43% were neutral, according to analyst FactSet. By comparison, 89% of analysts following Facebook are recommending a buy and none are posting sell ratings. Sell notes account for just 6% of all the analyst recommendations covering the S&amp;P 500 list of the top US companies.<br></p><p>Analysts are concerned that Twitter’s growth is slowing and that while Twitter’s revenue is more than doubling each quarter, it has yet to make a profit. Shyam Patil, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said for many analysts the company’s share price had risen “too far too fast”.</p><p>Patil, who has a neutral rating on the company, said no new information had come out on the company before the quarterly results, and the share price had been driven up by expectations rather than facts. “I think it’s a good business. It is clearly differentiated from the competition,” he said. He said Twitter had yet to figure out how it was going to make money, and that at the moment the sky-high valuation was based on bets that it would hit on a lucrative plan.</p><p>“You could see an incredible house and think it’s worth half a million only to find out it’s being sold for $2m. It’s still a great house,” he said.</p><p>In recent months, Twitter has made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to tweets. The moves are designed to improve “engagement” – a key measure for advertisers who want to see their content favourited, retweeted and commented upon.</p><p>Twitter is still growing quickly. The disappointing quarterly figures still represents a 30% rise year on year. But it accounts for a very small portion of the overall digital ad market. Twitter accounted for 0.5% of global digital ad revenues in 2013, according to eMarketer, up compared to 0.3% in 2012. Facebook, by comparison, accounts for 5.7% of global digital ad spending.

By now, more than 90% should have been surrendered, according to a timeline prescribed by the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p><p>Neither body would comment on Wednesday, saying the situation \"spoke for itself\". The US secretary of state, John Kerry, warned earlier this week that there would be \"consequences\" if the terms of the deal were not honoured. The agreement had stipulated that all 500 tonnes of \"category two\" chemicals were to have been moved to the port of Latakia on Syria's north-west coast by Wednesday. Another 700 tonnes should have left the country by 31 December.</p><p>Russia, which was instrumental in brokering the deal, played down the delays and said Syria would still move out a large quantity of chemicals by the end of February. The issue of Syria's chemical weapons, one of the largest arsenals anywhere in the world, has been one of the most contentious themes of the civil war, which is now nearing a fourth year and showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>After face-to-face talks in Geneva last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/syria-peace-talks-low-expectations-have-not-been-disappointed\" title=\"\">failed to yield any substantive concessions</a>, Russia said regime officials would attend a second round scheduled to resume next Monday. However, hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough appear dim as fighting continues to rage in several parts of the country, particularly Aleppo.</p><p>Activists in Syria's largest city claim that more than 1,200 people have been killed there since the first day of the Geneva summit on 22 January. Aleppo's high toll has been caused by internecine fighting between rebel groups and a daily barrage of high explosive bombs, filled with shrapnel and fuel, dropped from helicopters high above the city that wreak massive destruction on neighbourhoods below.</p><p>Medics in Aleppo claim that 15 children sheltering in a mosque were killed early on Wednesday when one such bomb struck the building. It was reportedly being used as a school. Kerry said the regime was attempting to boost its battlefield standing before another Geneva round. \"Each and every day that the barrel-bombing of Aleppo continues, the Assad regime reminds the world of its true colours,\" he said in a statement. \"It is the latest barbaric act of a regime that has committed organised, wholesale torture, used chemical weapons, and is starving whole communities by blocking delivery of food to Syrian civilians in urgent need.</p><p>\"Given this horrific legacy, the Syrian people would never accept as legitimate a government including Assad.\"</p><p>Aleppo has also been under heavy ground attack by forces allied to the Syrian army, including the Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas militia, comprised largely of Iraqi Shias who have travelled to Syria to support the regime.</p><p>The opposition held east of the city has remained in a state of chaos in recent weeks as the main al-Qaida group, the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (Isis), has fought a series of battles with other opposition groups, led by a new configuration of militants known as the Islamic Front.</p><p>While the latter has succeeded in chasing Isis out of many of its strongholds, the fighting has exposed Aleppo's defences and allowed Syrian forces and their allies to advance for the first time in more than a year. Regime elements are close to the city's eastern borders and have reopened Aleppo airport, which had been mostly closed since rebels first took half of the city in July 2012.</p><p>Isis, which is largely made up of foreign jihadists, principally Iraqis, claimed on Wednesday to have struck a truce with the Islamic Front to end all fighting. Isis remains in control of the city of Raqqa in northern Syria and the desert region leading to Iraq.</p>","headline":"Syria misses another chemical weapons deadline","trailText":"Officials blame civil war for delay and say they are still committed to destroying arsenal","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfym","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391624848652/Free-Syrian-Army-fighter-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391624848652/Free-Syrian-Army-fighter-006.jpg","wordcount":"681","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428998672","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8650268","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Chulov in Beirut","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038873","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T18:28:39Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/syria-misses-chemical-weapons-deadline","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/syria-misses-chemical-weapons-deadline","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/chemical-weapons","webTitle":"Chemical weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/chemical-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-chulov","webTitle":"Martin Chulov","r2ContributorId":"29038","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290791972910/martin-chulov.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Chulov covers the Middle East for the Guardian.

His colleagues in the armed forces' governing council <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">mandated</a> him to run last Monday – and his popularity is so high among certain sections of the population that he is expected to win by a landslide.</p><p>But throughout all the hype, Sisi had not publicly confirmed his candidacy. That appeared to change in the early hours of Thursday morning, when Kuwaiti newspaper al-Seyasia published what they said was an interview with the man himself.</p><p>In the article, Sisi was quoted appealing to Egyptians for patience amid worsening economic and social conditions.</p><p>\"I shall not refuse the request of the people of my country, but I will ask them to help,\" he reportedly said. \"Egypt is ill, very ill. It's been getting worse in the last few years. People realise that it's a heavy burden and it requires everybody's cooperation to carry it. Therefore, we have to share this load and work to heal our country from its illness.\"</p><p>An army spokesman later claimed that the interview was inaccurate. He said Sisi had not yet declared his intentions, and would only do so in an Egyptian context, \"in front of the sons of the great Egyptian people, in clear and direct words, leaving no room for doubt or interpretation\".</p><p></p><p>Analysts consistently warn that while Sisi currently has the backing of many sections of society, the electorate has proved fickle in the recent past. They say Sisi  risks losing popularity very quickly if he does not find prompt solutions to Egypt's many social problems.</p><p>Public sentiment is hard to quantify in Egypt. Over 98% of participants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/18/egypt-constitution-yes-vote-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">voted</a> for Egypt's new constitution this month, a sign of strong support for Sisi.</p><p>But only 38.6% of those eligible to vote took part – a respectable figure in comparison with past votes, but lower than Sisi might have hoped.</p><p>For their part, Morsi supporters detest the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">field marshal</a> for presiding over a campaign of oppression that has seen more than a thousand Morsi supporters killed, and thousands arrested.

Of those, 505 were men. <br></p><p>Basso was the first female inmate executed in the US since Kimberly McCarthy was put to death in Texas last June. Only four women have been executed nationwide since 2002 - three in Texas, which accounts for more than a third of the total number of prisoners executed in the US.</p><p>Basso declined to make a final statement and was pronounced dead at 6.26pm local time, eleven minutes after the lethal dose of pentobarbital was administered, Associated Press reported. <br></p><p>Basso's lawyer, Winston Cochran, asked the Supreme Court to review Texas's criteria for assessing the mental health of prisoners sentenced to death. <br></p><p>In earlier appeals to state and federal courts, Cochran argued that Basso was delusional and did not meet the standard of mental competency required for an execution to proceed.</p><p>However, last month a judge in Houston ruled that Basso was competent enough to be executed. Cochran also contended that she had not received a fair trial. He said that no mitigating evidence was presented, the testimony of a medical examiner was questionable and no testimony or evidence showed that she personally killed Musso or proves exactly how he died.</p><p>Originally from New York, Basso was found guilty of the 1998 murder of 59-year-old Louis \"Buddy\" Musso.</p><p>According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, she lured the mentally-disabled man from New Jersey to Texas under the pretence that she would marry him. But she the ringleader of a group who tortured and killed him by kicking and beating him with belts, baseball bats and steel-toed boots. He was found by a road in a Houston suburb with extensive injuries.</p><p>Basso's five co-defendants, including her son, were convicted of involvement in Musso's killing but not sentenced to death. At the trial in 1999 it was suggested that Basso hoped to cash in on his life insurance payout.</p><p>Women account for about 10% of murder arrests but only represent 2.1% of death sentences imposed at trial and less than 1% of completed executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. <br></p><p>There are now eight women on Texas' death row, including Linda Carty, a British citizen born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.</p>","headline":"Texas killer Suzanne Basso becomes 14th woman executed in US since 1976","trailText":"Suzanne Basso's last-minute appeal that she was 'mentally delusional' fails and she iskilled by lethal injection<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgxa","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391654150490/a62d5db4-8193-4bb9-84f3-d500edeeb2f7-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391654150490/a62d5db4-8193-4bb9-84f3-d500edeeb2f7-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"431","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429026098","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2f282e4b0530e249db035","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Dart in Houston","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039050","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:45:15+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-killer-basso-woman-executed-us-death-penalty","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/texas-killer-basso-woman-executed-us-death-penalty","tags":[{"id":"world/texas","webTitle":"Texas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/texas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/texas","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","references":[]},{"id":"world/capital-punishment","webTitle":"Capital punishment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/capital-punishment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/capital-punishment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-dart","webTitle":"Tom Dart","r2ContributorId":"50797","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/9/1336571916728/Tom-Dart-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Dart is a Houston-based freelance journalist.

concessions to address regulatory concerns about its search results, the European commission said on Wednesday, taking the company a step closer to settling a three-year investigation and prevent a fine of up to $5bn (£3.1bn).</p><p>The world's dominant search engine has been the focus of a European commission investigation since November 2010, after more than a dozen complainants across Europe accused the company of promoting its own services at their expense.</p><p>Google has now made three attempts to resolve the case, with the latest moves looking like they will be enough to settle it.</p><p>\"I believe that the new proposal obtained from Google after long and difficult talks can now address the commission's concerns,\" said competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia.</p><p>The commission said it would make a final decision after obtaining feedback from Google's rivals.</p><p>Reuters reported on 29 January that the EU's competition authority and Google were close to a deal to resolve the investigation.</p><p>Google's success in escaping possibly heavier sanctions mirrors a similar outcome in the United States last year, where Google received only a mild reprimand from the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Almunia, who has been in charge of anti-trust issues at the European commission since 2009, has developed a track record of resolving cases via settlements rather than fines.</p><p>Google's ability to resolve competition issues in two major regions without a fine stands in sharp contrast to rival Microsoft, whose prickly relations with EU regulators have landed it total fines of more than €2.2bn (£1.8bn) over the past decade.</p><p>Under its latest proposals Google, which has a 75% share of the European search market according to consultancy comScore, will let three rivals display their logos and web links in a prominent box, and content providers will be able to decide what material Google can use for its own services.</p><p>Google will also scrap restrictions that prevent advertisers from moving their campaigns to rival platforms such as Yahoo!'s search tool and Microsoft's Bing.</p>","headline":"Google offers further search result concessions

We're looking at some weekend storms and we have enough for that, but we're going to start to get low. We need some good weather and a chance to replenish our supplies.\" </p><p>As of 26 January, New Jersey had spent $60m on snow removal, putting it in place to break the record of $62.5m spent last year, Dee said. Connecticut was on pace to exceed its $30m budget, but had the means to continue funding snow removal, a department of transportation spokesman said. </p><p>New York City has spread some 346,000 tons of rock salt on its roads so far this year, almost the total for last winter, said Belinda Mager, a spokeswoman for the city department of sanitation. The city has spent $57.3m on snow removal so far this winter, putting it on track to top last year's spending. </p><p>Most US states and major cities do not try to set an upper limit on spending for snow removal, but authorize agencies to spend what is necessary and count on legislatures to cover the cost. \"Before I became governor, I never saw winter in budgetary terms, but now I do,\" Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick told local WBZ radio, adding that he was counting on lawmakers to fund the state's rising snow-removal and salt tab.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e89683e6-40a5-44d7-977d-dbe9f28978cc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391619845093/d45bd6d7-b979-4dd2-8239-1fd40f372a18-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Albany new york snow\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Hundreds of schools closed in New York.

With major rock salt shortages, it's starting to get scary out there,\" said Anthony Scorzetti, a hardware and paint manager for Braen Supply in Wanaque, New Jersey. \"I have people calling from all parts of the East Coast looking for it, and we just have nothing.\"</p><p>Heavy show was expected from the Great Lakes through New England, with freezing rain dominating south of New York. In the Boston area, snow was falling at a rate of 1-2in (2-5cm) per hour, making roads treacherous and causing school closings.</p><p>\"The worst will be along the higher terrain, around central New England,\" said Benjamin Sipprell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \"Southern parts of Vermont and New Hampshire around the border with Massachusetts could see up to around a foot of snow.\"</p><p>By mid-morning, 9.5in (24cm) of snow had fallen in Burlington, in central Connecticut, 9in (23cm) in Southbridge, in southern Massachusetts, and 12.5in (32cm) in Newburgh, New York, north of New York City, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>Connecticut's governor urged people to stay off icy roads. \"With heavy snow falling across the state and a mix of sleet and freezing rain on the way, I am asking residents to avoid unnecessary travel,\" said Dannel Malloy. \"If you can stay home or work from home, please do.\"</p><p>Almost 900,000 homes and businesses were without power in the US midwest and north-east early Wednesday following severe snow and ice storms overnight, according to local power companies. The hardest hit state was Pennsylvania, with over 640,000 customers without power on Wednesday morning. Other hard-hit states include Maryland, West Virginia, Arkansas, New Jersey, Kentucky, Delaware, Ohio, Virginia, Indiana and New York.</p><p>In New York City, schools were open despite the weather. In Brooklyn, parents were walking their kids to class as crews used electric snowblowers to keep sidewalks clear. Renita Stefanec dropped off her seven-year-old for class with her five-year-old in tow. \"It's sloppy, it's messy, but if you live close it's doable,\" she said of the trek. \"If it's too bad out, they just don't come. They keep the kids home. But if you're close, it's doable.\"</p><p>Even with all the bad weather this winter, schools have stayed open, something Stefanec thinks is a good idea. \"I prefer them to come to school. Because if they don't, they take it away from vacation days.\"</p>","headline":"US north-east hit by snow, sleet and ice as states struggle to maintain services","trailText":"Storm drops almost a foot of snow in some states as New York braces for salt shortage and Pennsylvania loses power","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfjq","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391619734980/6ee16f12-187f-4ce2-bbab-d699bd27609c-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391619734980/6ee16f12-187f-4ce2-bbab-d699bd27609c-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"815","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428995155","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f26be1e4b0ab978b0f96c0","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038823","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T12:15:55-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/us-northeast-snow-storm-ice-salt-power","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/us-northeast-snow-storm-ice-salt-power","tags":[{"id":"world/us-weather","webTitle":"US weather","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-weather","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-weather","references":[]},{"id":"world/new-york","webTitle":"New York","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-york","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/new-york","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/new-jersey","webTitle":"New Jersey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-jersey","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/new-jersey","references":[]},{"id":"world/snow","webTitle":"Snow","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/snow","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/snow","references":[]},{"id":"world/pennsylvania","webTitle":"Pennsylvania","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/pennsylvania","references":[]},{"id":"world/massachusetts","webTitle":"Massachusetts","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/massachusetts","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/massachusetts","references":[]},{"id":"world/boston","webTitle":"Boston","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/boston","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/boston","references":[]},{"id":"world/connecticut","webTitle":"Connecticut","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/connecticut","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/connecticut","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-c435b33e-6a6b-4254-9fea-b3a5497e924b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391619705461/49ba9868-e2c5-472d-ad54-d8a8b97eb611-620x372.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391619705461/49ba9868-e2c5-472d-ad54-d8a8b97eb611-620x372.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"Matt Rourke","altText":"philadelphia ice snow","height":"372","credit":"Matt Rourke/AP","caption":"An ice covered tree limb that took out a utility line blocks a road in Philadelphia.

The leader of an extremist religious party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, described Mehsud as a martyr.</p><p>It also energised the campaign of Imran Khan, the charismatic opposition politician strongly opposed to military operations in North Waziristan.</p><p>After a US drone attack on a madrasa just outside the tribal areas on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/senior-taliban-haqqani-killed-us-drone-strike-pakistan\" title=\"\">21 November</a>, Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party launched a blockade against Nato supply convoys travelling into Afghanistan through the Khyber pass.</p><p>US restraint is not unlimited, however. It is understood the CIA will still launch attacks if the opportunity to kill a senior target becomes available.</p><p>The government's gingerly move towards military operations in North Waziristan has faltered however – despite the lack of drone strikes.</p><p>It had been widely assumed that a surge in deadly militant attacks, particularly on army targets, had led the government to finally back military operations, with senior Pakistani officials confirming as much to western officials.</p><p>However, Sharif had a last minute change of mind, announcing last week a four-man committee to try once again to kickstart peace talks.</p><p>An initial meeting between the government team and intermediaries who had agreed to represent the TTP was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/pakistan-talks-taliban-cancelled-imran-khan\" title=\"\">cancelled on Tuesday at the last minute</a>.</p><p>There is little agreement on what exactly triggered Sharif's sudden decision to give peace talks another try, with analysts suggesting an ongoing fear of political attacks by Khan, deep concern over deadly retaliation by the TTP in the cities of Punjab and the dragging on of the trial of former dictator Pervez Musharraf, which has raised tension between Pakistan's politicians and generals.</p><p>\"There is still reluctance because Sharif's entire policy is to somehow protect Punjab province,\" Hussain said. \"It cannot work, however. They can postpone the inevitable but for not very long.\"</p><p>It is not the first time the US has reined in the drones. There was a six-week hiatus in 2011 following the accidental killing by US aircraft of 24 Pakistani troops near the Afghan border.</p><p>In the early days Pakistan enjoyed a veto over drone strikes, although that changed in mid-2008 when President George Bush became fed up with being unable to attack militants responsible for the death of US troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>A dramatic rise in drone strikes continued and increased under Barack Obama, although they have fallen off again in the past 18 months.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university\" title=\"\">rare speech</a> on drone policy last May, Barack Obama hinted US strikes in Pakistan would tail off over the long-term as US troops would require less \"force protection\" provided by drones as they withdraw from Afghanistan.</p><p>Pakistan denies it has any involvement in the drone programme, regularly lodging formal complaints when strikes occur.</p><p>But US officials familiar with the programme say the strikes would be impossible without some level of Pakistani consent.</p><p>Some senior officials in Pakistan regard them as a necessary evil but rarely say so in public.</p><p>Last month Rana Sanaullah, one of Sharif's closest aides, told the Guardian that \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/pakistan-war-footing-taliban\" title=\"\">drone attacks damage the terrorists</a>, very much.\"</p><p>\"Inside, everyone believes that drone attacks are good;

The international community has long ago reached a verdict about it,\" the ministry said. </p><p>\"A handful of people in Japan have tried to blot out, cover up and distort that history,\" it said. \"Such behaviour is in the same line as those of some Japanese leaders who try to reverse history. The international community should be highly vigilant at this.\" </p><p>China's ties with Japan have long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo's failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during the second world war. </p><p>Deteriorating relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been fuelled by a row over a chain of disputed islands in the East China Sea. Ships from both countries frequently shadow each other around the islets, raising fears of a clash. </p><p>Ties have further worsened since China's creation of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the controversial Yasukuni shrine honouring war criminals among Japan's war dead. <br></p>","headline":"China fury at Japanese claim that Nanjing massacre never took place","trailText":"Board member at Japan's state broadcaster denies infamous slaughter in 1937 of at least 140,000 people did not happen<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg2x","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664443307/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664443307/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"339","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429030560","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f319f0e4b0ab978b0f9749","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039068","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T16:45:27+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/china-japanese-nanjing-massacre-never-took-place","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/china-japanese-nanjing-massacre-never-took-place","tags":[{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/china","references":[]},{"id":"world/japan","webTitle":"Japan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/japan","references":[]},{"id":"world/senkaku-islands","webTitle":"Senkaku Islands","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/senkaku-islands","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-4931ed6a-ad99-459c-b04b-2867c160bb57","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664442466/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664442466/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-220x132.jpeg","source":"  Bettmann/CORBIS","altText":"Japanese forces close in on Nanjing in 1937.

As part of the agreement, Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear programme and accept more scrutiny of its activities, in exchange for partial relief from sanctions.</p><p>As Iranian scientists halted all enrichment of uranium to 20% inside the country, the EU reciprocated by announcing moves to ease restrictions on trade in petrochemicals, precious metals and the provision of insurance for oil shipments. This week, the US released $550m to Iran, the first instalment in $4.2bn worth of frozen oil revenues which the Islamic republic is expected to receive over a period of time as part of the Geneva deal.</p><p>Despite these developments, the US has warned France that it will seek fines against any country – ally or not – that breaks the US and EU sanctions.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fd1e250c-8a5c-11e3-9c29-00144feab7de.html\" title=\"\">The 116-strong French business delegation represented many major French international companies</a>, including Total, Peugeot, Citroën, Lafarge, GDF Suez and Alstom. There was even a representative from the football club AJ Auxerre, offering French savoir-faire over the training of players.</p><p>Thierry Courtaigne, vice-president of the French employers' organisation Medef, said the delegation, which arrived in Tehran on Monday, wanted to assess the commercial opportunities there.</p><p>The French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said at the weekend that France would have \"significant commercial opportunities\" in Iran if sanctions were lifted.</p><p>Moscovici said the visit was intended to \"convey the message that, if the situation improves, there will be significant commercial opportunities for France in Iran\".</p><p>Iranian leaders gave the French delegation a warm welcome, promising new measures to encourage foreign investment, particularly in oil and gas.</p><p>Iranian newspapers have given the French visit significant coverage during the past week. \"Tehran's lucrative offer to Paris,\" read the Tuesday headline of the reformist daily Shargh.</p><p>According to Shargh, Mohammad-Reza Najafimanesh, of the Iranian auto parts manufacturer association, said the visit showed French investors and businessmen were opposed to the French government's record of a harsh approach to sanctions.</p><p>Mohammad Nahavandian, the head of the Iranian president's office, said Tehran's relations with the international community had been upgraded to a \"win-win\" situation. \"It's a reasonable decision on their part to become a partner of a strong economy [like Iran],\" he said. \"There's a unique opportunity.\"</p><p>As the EU relaxed punitive measures on Iran as a result of the interim deal, Renault said last week it had resumed exports of spare parts to Iran and that it was hoping production of the Tondar, an Iranian version of the company's cheap Logan model, would increase slowly through the first six months of 2014.</p><p>Medef has defended the visit, saying the Austrians, Germans, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese and even the Americans have been on the business trail to Iran before.</p><p>Pierre Gattaz, the head of Medef, said the delegation had not violated the terms of the interim nuclear accord.</p><p>\"We faultlessly respected the Geneva convention of last November. We're familiar with this framework. There are other European country delegations who were in Iran,\" he said.</p><p>Last month, the US Treasury received $152m (£93m) from Luxembourg after the financial house Clearstream Banking was found to have illegally helped Iran's central bank to access the US finance system in 2007 and 2008 in violation of US sanctions.</p><p>Iran and the world's major powers have announced they will continue talks on 18 February in Vienna over a comprehensive agreement aimed at settling the decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear activities and the complete lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions. But those talks are threatened by hardliners both in the US and Iran. A significant number of US senators want more sanctions while hawks in Iran criticise the president, Hassan Rouhani, for agreeing to the interim deal. The US president, Barack Obama, however, has made clear he will veto any new sanctions bill as long as talks have not failed.</p>","headline":"US warns France against business with Iran after trade trip to Tehran","trailText":"John Kerry issues warning to counterpart after large French delegation travels to Iranian capital","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfb6","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391605231068/Renault-Asia-Chief-Norman-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391605231068/Renault-Asia-Chief-Norman-006.jpg","wordcount":"770","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428970989","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8647348","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kim Willsher in Paris and Saeed Kamali Dehghan","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038587","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T13:09:10Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/us-warns-france-business-iran-trade-tehran","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/us-warns-france-business-iran-trade-tehran","tags":[{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/john-kerry","webTitle":"John Kerry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/john-kerry","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"business/renault","webTitle":"Renault","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/renault","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/renault","references":[]},{"id":"business/automotive-industry","webTitle":"Automotive industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/automotive-industry","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kim-willsher","webTitle":"Kim Willsher","r2ContributorId":"38215","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/30/1317399986248/kim.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kim Willsher is an award-winning foreign correspondent based in Paris</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kim-willsher","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/kim-willsher","references":[]},{"id":"profile/saeedkamalidehghan","webTitle":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan","r2ContributorId":"27142","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/29/1359471686287/Saeed-Kamali-Dehghan_2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Saeed Kamali Dehghan is an Iranian journalist for the Guardian.

comedy?","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-06T12:00:08Z","sectionName":"Culture","sectionId":"culture","id":"culture/2014/feb/06/jimmy-fallon-jay-leno-tonight-show-nbc","fields":{"standfirst":"<p>NBC hopes social media-savvy Fallon will revive Tonight Show by attracting young viewers while retaining Jay Leno loyalists</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-06T12:00:06.668Z","body":"<p>Earlier this week, Jimmy Fallon, the newly crowned king of American late-night TV comedy, was asked by reporters at the Television Critics Association to describe his feelings about taking over the helm of the legendary Tonight Show. He recalled, twinkly-eyed, how as a kid he had begged his parents to let him watch the show under its then host Johnny Carson “because I knew it was on really late and I was getting away with something”.<br></p><p>When Fallon takes over the reigns from Jay Leno, who broadcasts his final Tonight Show after 22 years on Thursday night, he knows that much more is at stake than childhood nostalgia. He faces the supreme challenge of instilling in a new generation of young Americans that same mildly naughty desire to stay up late and watch him.</p><p>There is a great deal riding on that, including nothing less than the sustainability of the late-night comedy genre that was pioneered by the Tonight Show in 1954 but is now a pale reflection of its former glory, battered by fierce competition from Jon Stewart’s Daily Show and the like as well as the chill blast of the internet.  The financial wellbeing of NBC is also in play, with advertising revenue slumping almost to half its 2007 level by 2012 to <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/21/entertainment/la-et-ct-jimmy-fallon-late-night-20130321\">below $150m</a>.</p><p>Then there’s the fate of the 40-year-old Fallon himself, who graduates from his current late-night slot to the Tonight Show on 17 February. Will he mature into the job to become another feature of the US cultural landscape, his face carved into the Mount Rushmore of late-night comedy alongside Carson, who hosted 4,531 episodes of the Tonight Show, and Leno, who has hosted 4,610 since 1992?</p><p>Or will he crash out like Conan O’Brien, whose catastrophic attempt to replace Leno came to a <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-says-he-wont-do-tonight-show-following-leno/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">spectacular end in 2010</a> after just 146 episodes?</p><p>Bill Carter, author of The War for Late Night, and who reports on television for the New York Times, gives Fallon two or three years to prove himself. “He has to keep the Tonight Show in its number one slot. But he also has to be hip enough to get the critical reaction that NBC wants – Jay Leno had lost that entirely; he was denigrated by critics for being too mainstream.”</p><p>On one level, Fallon’s brand of comedy is quite conventional, as befits an alumnus of Saturday Night Live who quit in 2004 to mount a failed bid to break into Hollywood. He has largely dispensed with the irony bordering on sarcasm on which so much modern comedy depends, returning instead to a prelapsarian humour drawing on his good-natured style and taste in silly costumes. On the other hand, he is a master at divining what will go viral – a crucial skill in the age of TV recording devices and social media.</p><p>Take his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/chris-christie-aide-new-jersey-lane-closing \">recent lampoon </a>of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor under fire because of those traffic problems over the George Washington bridge. Fallon’s remake of Born To Run, in which he mimics Bruce Springsteen and is then joined on stage by the Boss himself, was not just sublime television, but had the benefit of attracting more than 4 million views on YouTube<a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-says-he-wont-do-tonight-show-following-leno/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\"> </a></p><p>His riff on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA \">hashtags</a> with Justin Timberlake<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA\"> </a>has been viewed more than 21m times on YouTube, and his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ajQ-foj2Q \">lip sync battle</a> with Stephen Merchant almost 11m times. Both were helped along the way by Fallon’s 11m Twitter followers.</p><p>Eric Deggans, TV critic for National Public Radio, says that Fallon’s popularity on social media is not a fluke, as his strain of humour is in tune with the 18-35 demographic that all late-night TV producers are desperate to reach. “He has a comedy that mixes up cultures and musical sounds in a way that feels distinctly millennial,” Deggans says.</p><p>Instead of a bland confected studio band, Fallon is supported by the hip-hop band the Roots. Instead of a faintly sycophantic guest interview with Barack Obama, Fallon persuaded the president last April to<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\"> “slow jam” the news</a> to the Roots’s R&amp;B backing, notching up another 8m views on YouTube . Instead of reciting a list of hit-or-miss jokes in the comfortable mould of his competitors, Fallon will perform a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\">“</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWsBirqxEjA\">history of rap</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4\">”</a> with Timberlake<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWsBirqxEjA\"> </a> that is, depending on your taste, either strikingly accomplished or remarkably childish. Or both.</p><p>The billion-dollar question is whether Fallon’s social media largesse will feed back into ratings. The latest ratings figures from Nielsen have the Tonight Show hosting enjoying an average nightly audience of about 3.8 million people – well down from the 6 million Leno used to attract a decade ago.</p><p>The show remains the most viewed late-night programme, but among the most sought-after viewership of 18- to 49-year-olds, Jimmy Kimmel on ABC is gaining ground, and is now drawing nightly on average 0.9 million in that demographic compared to Leno’s 1.1m. That statistic alone helps explain NBC’s decision to finally – and presumably permanently this time – ditch its veteran star and jump a generation to Fallon.</p><p>As in so much of late-night television, age is key. The median age of Leno’s audience as he brings his era to a close is a shocking 57.8 years – on a par with his great rival David Letterman on CBS. Fallon and Kimmel hover around the 50-year mark, while only O’Brien paradoxically attracts an audience with a median age below 40.</p><p>O’Brien’s problem was that, though he performs well among the young, he alienated Leno’s ageing following, thus bringing the Tonight Show to the edge of the precipice of losing its prime position. Fallon will now be under pressure to hang on to as many loyal Leno viewers as he can, while gradually transitioning to a younger crowd.</p><p>“My hunch is that many of Leno’s older fans will not take readily to Jimmy Fallon and many will switch to Letterman,” cautions Deggans.</p><p>Despite the heavy task ahead, Fallon is going into the new job wearing his trademark cheery face. “I’ll do whatever it takes,” he told Vulture. “If you want me to sing, I’ll sing. You want me to dance, I’ll dance. You want me to dress as a woman, I’ll dress like a woman.”</p>","headline":"Jimmy Fallon takes the Tonight Show baton: can he  save late-night comedy?","trailText":"NBC hopes social media-savvy Fallon will revive Tonight Show by attracting young viewers while retaining Jay Leno loyalists","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfz4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391635620110/538e912b-4108-4d12-a40f-8d402a602cc4-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391635620110/538e912b-4108-4d12-a40f-8d402a602cc4-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1018","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429004922","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f28acde4b0530e249dafdc","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ed Pilkington in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038936","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:00:08Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/06/jimmy-fallon-jay-leno-tonight-show-nbc","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2014/feb/06/jimmy-fallon-jay-leno-tonight-show-nbc","tags":[{"id":"culture/jimmy-fallon","webTitle":"Jimmy Fallon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-fallon","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/jimmy-fallon","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity","references":[]},{"id":"media/jay-leno","webTitle":"Jay Leno","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jay-leno","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/jay-leno","references":[]},{"id":"media/nbc","webTitle":"NBC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/nbc","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/nbc","references":[]},{"id":"media/ustelevision","webTitle":"US television industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ustelevision","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/ustelevision","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/edpilkington","webTitle":"Ed Pilkington","rcsId":"GNL038863","r2ContributorId":"15609","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/3/27/1332862968426/edpilkington_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ed Pilkington is the chief reporter for Guardian US.
