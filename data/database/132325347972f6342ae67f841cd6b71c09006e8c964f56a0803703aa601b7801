The opening scene features real grass, real ploughs, real soil and – said Boyle – real clouds that would supply \"rain\" if there was none in order to ensure an authentically British atmosphere. With no Glastonbury festival this year, the event will be evoked with a replica of Glastonbury Tor and mosh pits at either end of the arena.</p><p>One of those pits will have a Last Night of the Proms theme and the other a festival atmosphere, with around 100 young people in each.</p><p>While the show will open with a rural pastoral vision that evokes William Blake and Jerusalem, it is expected to evolve to take on a more urban hue. Boyle said he would not reveal how the \"puzzle fits together\" and he refused to confirm any of the acts taking part, although Sir Paul McCartney has already confirmed his involvement and the likes of Take That and The Who are also expected to feature.</p><p>But the director underlined that it was not a musical show, but a narrative set to music. The electronic group Underworld have already recorded two lengthy tracks at Abbey Road to score the action. The closing ceremony will be a more traditional celebration of British music.</p><p>Boyle had already revealed that the three-hour opening ceremony would be titled Isles of Wonder, a title based on a speech by Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest that will be referenced throughout the four ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Stephen Daldry, the Billy Elliot director who is overseeing all four ceremonies, said the ceremony was Boyle's \"singular vision\" rather than being developed by committee. In all, the ceremonies will cost £81m – a figure that doubled from the original budget.</p><p>If the jubilee weekend was a festival of pageantry and heritage, it already appears that Boyle's opening ceremony will be a more playful and anarchic treatment of British culture.</p><p>\"You're bound to fail, that's built in. But you hope that on the journey, you hope people will find enough in it to feel that it is representative of us,\" said Boyle.</p><p>He said there would be British humour and that the country's history would be represented but \"not in a box-ticking way\", and the show would reflect \"parts of our heritage but looking forward as well\".</p><p>A troupe of NHS nurses will appear in one sequence, but Boyle said the show would not be overtly political.</p><p>\"This is a festival of celebration of an Olympic ideal. But it's not a naive show. We're trying to show the best of us, but we're also trying to show many different things about our country. The growth of cities is an extraordinary phenomenon that is clearly linked to the growth of the Olympic Games.\"</p><p>The cast and crew, which will number 10,000 once volunteers are taken into account, have one more weekend of rehearsals in Dagenham before moving into the stadium – where the replica of Glastonbury Tor and the giant bell are already in position. There have already been 157 rehearsals.</p><p>The BBC confirmed that it would supply two short films to the opening ceremony and Boyle said it would differ from previous Games in being more cinematic in tone, rather than relying on scale alone.</p><p>\"We're trying to make you feel like you're watching a live film being made,\" said the Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting director. \"It feels like when you're planning a big sequence in a film. We're trying to make it feel like a live recording of a film that all happens on one evening. We're trying to shoot it in a very visceral way.</p><p>One of the major challenges will be keeping the athletes, who will parade around a circuit designed to evoke the M25 or London's north circular road, moving.</p><p>\"There is an hour of culture, then there is the parade of athletes and the lighting of the cauldron and the fireworks. In between that, there is the protocol – the speeches and the raising of the flags. All of that is preceded by the arrival of the head of state,\"</p><p>Boyle said the giant bell, hanging at one end of the stadium, sounded \"absolutely amazing\". It will ring to begin the show.</p><p>\"You will feel different when you're in there and you hear it ring. When you hear it it's very sweet. It's ancient, so it reminds you of the past. It's also timeless, so it evokes the future. That was how communities notified each other something important was about to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Boyle also teased that there would be \"real clouds\" over the stadium.</p><p>\"They will be real clouds that will be hanging over the stadium. Work that out if you can. We know we're an island culture and an island climate. One of these clouds will provide rain on the evening, just in case it doesn't rain.\"</p>","headline":"Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals","trailText":"Director Danny Boyle reveals plans for London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, including village cricket, maypoles and rain<br />","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/12/1339496084154/Olympic-opening-ceremony--003.jpg","wordcount":"893","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"391466427","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6289877","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Gibson, Olympics editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1758359","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-15T10:33:11Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/danny-boyle","references":[]},{"id":"culture/cultural-olympiad","webTitle":"Cultural Olympiad","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682482177/Owen-Gibson.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

It will start with what she calls a &ldquo;friendly hedge, framed in a diamond, in recognition of the queen&rsquo;s jubilee&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s called the Diamond Jubilee Hedge, and on Monday will launch the eventers on their 10-minute journey over 28 oddly shaped obstacles.<br /><br />Obstacle six, called the Planet and inspired by the nearby Greenwich Observatory, is particularly bizarre, and it will be intriguing to see how the riders orbit it. If they get past that, their next obstacle will be a crescent moon. Benson holds out great hope for this fence, saying &ldquo;the photographic opportunities will put equestrian sports on the map forever&rdquo;. &ldquo;Jumping into space requires a leap of faith,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;but Olympic competitors are used to this.&rdquo; With a backdrop of the Queen&rsquo;s House and Canary Wharf across the river, this could be the picture that Locog will say justifies the &pound;60m-plus spent building the temporary equestrian facilities at Greenwich.<br /><br />Further down the course, riders will encounter the River Bank, Saxon Village, Ancient Market Place, East End Barrows, and the Tower of London &ndash; Danny Boyle is not the only one making the Olympics an excuse to reflect on British history. There&rsquo;s a fence in honour of Greenwich, another called the Altar whose meaning is not entirely clear, a homage to cricket with a fence featuring bats and stumps, and best of all from my point of view as a chess nut a fence called the Chess Table with a chessboard and huge hand-made pieces. Naturally, the knights are prominent. The course ends with the Olympic Horses &ndash; two horses made of recycled horseshoes, framing a giant horseshoe. The riders have to jump through the horseshoe. The course is strange, elegant, eccentric and should be fun both to ride and decode.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50129baf95cb5fcda7f95216\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-03T14:38:14.369+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hockey</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Team GB&rsquo;s women hockey players are in peak form, according to goalkeeper Beth Storry, 34, a former bronze medalist at the European Championships, the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games.<br /><br />From not qualifying for the Athens 2004 Olympics, to ranking ninth at Beijing 2008, the team are now considered fourth best in the world and Storry told Press Association Sport the players &ldquo;really believe that we can beat all the teams out there.&rdquo;</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-501297efb579c24ed04374b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-03T14:38:14.369+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Laura Robson gets tennis place</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Laura Robson, who had been loitering nervously at the gates of the Olympic village as first alternative, has been handed an Olympic spot after the withdrawal of Croatia's Petra Martic, and will play Czech Lucie Safarova in the first round on Sunday.

Bolt chatted openly with Jackson and fans from across the world about developing a love of sport by watching cricket with his dad. </p> <p>His sprinting talent was noticed by his cricket coach, who encouraged him to run by offering to buy Bolt's lunch.</p> <p>Although he is now more of a football fan, Bolt would like to see Twenty20 introduced for future Olympics. </p> <p>Bolt was keen to talk about his early career, especially winning the 2002 World Junior Championships in Jamaica, which he rates as his most memorable achievement: \"That's one of the greatest moments for me. People say Beijing, but it's not. It was being at home and I've never been so nervous in my entire life. I won and that was a moment that defined my whole life. I cannot forget that moment. It was so much fun - so much awesome.\"</p> <p>Turning to the present day, Bolt gives an insight to his rivalry with Yohan Blake, his training partner. After <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNm6ZUuQTvk\">Blake won the 200m in the Olympic trials</a>, Bolt warned him: \"This is never going to happen again.\"</p> <p>\"I said that to him as I work so hard on my 200m and, when I watched the replay of that race, I was so disgusted I could not watch it again. My technique and years of practice went out the window in that race. It was really bad for me and really sad.

What kind of nation are we anyway?<br /><br />&bull; Usain Bolt has admitted for the first time that he has been suffered from a slight injury, but claims he is now fully recovered and ready to &ldquo;become a legend&rdquo;, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-olympics-usain-bolt\">Owen Gibson reports</a>.  Bolt was greeted with whoops and yelps from his fellow athletes, who seemed to recognise him as first among equals, when he turned up for a leisurely lunch at the athletes&rsquo; village yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-usain-bolt-olympic-canteen\">writes Robert Booth</a>. <br /><br />&bull; The Games may actually be David Cameron&rsquo;s economic strategy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-economic-strategy%20\">muses Marina Hyde</a>.</p> <p>&bull; Kings, queens and presidents will get the chance to experience a bit of British queuing tonight, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/diplomatic-niceties-world-leaders\">reports Julian Borger</a>, as they line up outside Buckingham Palace to travel from the Queen&rsquo;s reception to the Olympic Stadium. &ldquo;It will be first come, first served, and if you do not recognise &ndash; or are officially at war with &ndash; the country whose potentate you end up alongside, that will be too bad.&rdquo; <br /><br />&bull; No 10 was stunned by what my American colleagues are calling the &ldquo;Romneyshambles&rdquo; yesterday, when the US presidential candidate Mitt Romney, visiting London, made some negative and cautious comments about how the Games might turn out. Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney-olympics-blunder\">responded at last night&rsquo;s Olympic concert at Hyde Park</a>: \"I hear there's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready,\" the mayor yelled from the stage to a cheering crowd. \"He wants to know whether we're ready.

Yes, we are.\"<br /><br />&bull; Barney Ronay <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jul/26/great-britain-senegal-olympic-football\">marvels at the creation of the Team GB men&rsquo;s football team</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British amateur teams competed regularly at the Olympics until the Munich Games, but these are the first real, actual professional players to appear under the union flag. They will also probably be the last, so great are the assorted tensions in the wings of Team GB, chiefly the fear of loss of influence within football's governing body Fifa. Which is a shame as in the hours before kick-off Manchester seemed surprisingly hospitable to this footballing flag of convenience, the streets of the Piccadilly area thronging with newbie fans and the procession towards Old Trafford producing an eclectic pageant of mingled union flag-ishness, reminiscent of a high-Britpop music video or an extended Benny Hill credits sequence.</p> </blockquote> <p>&bull; And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-team-gb-senegal\">here is Andy Hunter&rsquo;s match GB v Senegal report</a>.

Daniel Craig's James Bond is also said to feature.</p> <p>Short video footage of rehearsals for the opening ceremony was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19000273\">shown on the BBC yesterday</a>. Scenes showing what appeared to be people with illuminated wings riding bicycles were broadcast under an agreement that allowed a 30-second clip to be shown by rights holders including the BBC 24 hours before the ceremony started.<br /><br />Today&rsquo;s events started off at around 6.55am when the <strong>Olympic torch</strong> began to make its stately way down the Thames on Gloriana, the Queen&rsquo;s rowbarge that featured in her jubilee flotilla, from Hampton Court Palace in south-west London to City Hall beside Tower Bridge, where it is due to arrive at around 12.55pm. The torch will then set off from City Hall to Stratford at 9pm and is due to appear at the Olympic Stadium at 11pm. It is still not known who will light the flame in the stadium, signalling the start of the Games, although bookmaker William Hill suspended betting yesterday on Roger Bannister, the first man to run a four-minute mile, after a run of big bets. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/26/olympic-opening-ceremony-flame\">Guardian readers have made their suggestions here</a>.<br /><br />And at 8.12am, open a window and see if you can hear Martin Creed&rsquo;s national artwork <a href=\"http://www.allthebells.com/\"><strong>All the Bells</strong></a>, which involves as many people as possible around the country ringing bells as loud as they can at the same time.<br /><br />The Olympic <strong>football</strong> tournament has already begun &ndash; with Great Britain's women starting in style with a 1-0 victory and the men's team drawing 1-1 in a bruising game against Senegal last night &ndash; and the <strong>archery</strong> gets going today, with men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s individual ranking rounds at Lord&rsquo;s at 9am and the team ranking rounds at 1pm.</p> <p>We'll have live coverage of all today's Olympic events here throughout the day, and tonight my colleague <strong>Xan Brooks</strong> will be on hand to guide you through the opening ceremony.

Boyle, the director of the London 2012 opening ceremony, has admitted it will be impossible to satisfy everyone","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T05:21:27Z","body":"<p>It must distil thousands of years of history into just over an hour, reflect a nation unto itself, promote Britain to the world, satisfy the demands of politicians and organisers, entertain 1bn viewers and bring the curtain up on the planet's biggest sporting event. So no pressure.</p><p>Film director Danny Boyle, the creative director of Friday night's £27m London 2012 opening ceremony, has already admitted that it will be an impossible task to satisfy everyone.</p><p>Instead, he has produced what has been described by overall ceremonies creative chief Stephen Daldry as a \"singular vision\", with music by electronic duo Underworld and other top British acts and with a denouement they are confident will stay secret despite the best efforts of the media.</p><p>The identity of the person who will light the Olympic cauldron is also a closely guarded secret, but bookmaker William Hill suspended betting on Thursday on Roger Bannister, the first man to run a four-minute mile, after a run of big bets.</p><p>Earlier, Team GB chef de mission Andy Hunt, who has some input into the decision, said a number of Britain's \"truly great Olympians\" would be involved in the \"final sequence\" of the ceremony, but would not reveal the identity of the cauldron lighter. British Olympic Association chairman Lord Moynihan was keen for Sir Steve Redgrave, winner of five Olympic gold medals for rowing, to light the cauldron, but Hunt's comments suggest he will be part of the final countdown rather than the ultimate bearer of the flame.</p><p>Boyle this week paid tribute to the 10,000 volunteers who have rehearsed for months, first in the old Ford plant in Dagenham, Essex, and then in the stadium, often in atrocious weather, to bring his script to life.</p><p>\"This is a show that has been built out of our volunteers – 10,000 people who've turned up in rain and terrible conditions. This show is theirs, this country is theirs, they really are the best of us,\" he said.</p><p>A troupe of nurses are among those appearing, even though culture secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to have questioned their inclusion at a time when government NHS reforms have provoked controversy. Footballer David Beckham will also play a role, he has confirmed.</p><p>\"The ceremony is an attempt to capture a picture of ourselves as a nation, where we have come from and where we want to be,\" the director of Trainspotting and the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire has said.</p><p>The show, titled Isles of Wonder after a speech by Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest, begins with a pastoral vision of a \"green and pleasant land\" complete with real sheep, pigs and goats, before transforming into a more urban landscape to reflect the \"dark satanic mills\" of William Blake's Jerusalem.</p><p>It will begin at 9pm with the ringing of the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, which hangs at one end of the stadium.</p><p>Preceding the main event, beginning at the symbolic time of 20.12, will be a warm-up show, chiefly designed to get the crowd in the mood.</p><p>The prime minister, David Cameron, said on Thursday he had no fears about Boyle's ability to deliver.</p><p>\"I've had some presentation meetings with Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry and others and spoken to people lucky enough to go to the rehearsals. I've always had that tingling feeling on my spine and the hairs standing on the back of my neck with the treatment they're giving it,\" he said.Whereas Beijing's opening ceremony was remembered for its jaw-dropping scale, Daldry said Boyle would employ creativity and humour.</p><p>Cameron acknowledged the size of the task, but said Boyle was up to it.</p><p>\"We have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential Britain has in the future. There are so many things to celebrate about our country that packing all that in must be a pretty tough task.\"</p><p>Asked whether the message of the opening ceremony would be Beefeaters or Blur, he said: \"Both.\"</p><p>The three-and-a-half-hour ceremony, which has had to be tightened up by 40 minutes to avoid overrunning, comprises the hour-long cultural showcase, the parade of athletes and officials from 204 nations and the protocol of flags, anthems and speeches, before the lighting of the cauldron and the obligatory fireworks.</p><p>The International Olympic Committee has issued a no dawdling edict, asking for athletes to maintain a steady pace around the track in order to keep the show on time. Some of Team GB's biggest names will be missing because they have not yet checked into the athletes' village or because they are competing within 48 hours of the ceremony.</p><p>Hunt said 260 of Team GB's 542 athletes would take part in the parade, led by flag bearer Sir Chris Hoy. Only 40 British officials will parade because numbers have been limited for the first time to speed proceedings along.</p><p>About 120,000 people who attended dress rehearsals on Monday and Wednesday have been asked to \"save the surprise\" and not reveal what they had seen. The campaign has been largely successful, although organisers had to step in to have a handful of videos removed from YouTube.</p>","headline":"Olympic Games 2012: 'Singular vision' as £27m worth of secrets unveiled","trailText":"Danny Boyle, the director of the London 2012 opening ceremony, has admitted it will be impossible to satisfy everyone","newspaperPageNumber":"7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/26/1343336934350/Danny-Boyle-003.jpg","wordcount":"837","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"393665157","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6467884","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Gibson, Olympics editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-07-27T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1779484","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-29T21:09:31Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/olympics-2012-danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jul/26/olympics-2012-danny-boyle","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/danny-boyle","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682482177/Owen-Gibson.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

Don't forget to stay active for as long as you can before it begins, to drink lots of water and to move around as much as possible during the ceremony, maybe by mimicking the dancers or decanting all your Pepsi into old Coke cans so as not to offend any sponsors.</p><h2>Ignore the bit with the athletes</h2><p>When people talk about the Beijing opening ceremony, what do they always mention? The levitating rings? Yes. The millions of perfectly syncronised drummers? Yes. The really long bit in the middle where all of the athletes competing in the Olympics trundled around the stadium really slowly in what basically amounted to single file? No. Be honest – on television it is always the least essential part of the ceremony, and you'd do well to avoid it completely. Yes, you'll miss Chris Hoy carrying a flag, but everyone knows what Chris Hoy looks like. He's the man from all the Bran Flakes adverts, right?</p><h2>Forget the storyline</h2><p>On paper, the opening ceremony will be the realisation of Danny Boyle's grand vision – an epic opera about a land recovering from its industrial legacy. Who knows whether that will translate to your television screen. But if not – don't worry: even if the concept goes out the window within a minute or two, we'll still have a load of people in silly costumes charging about and flapping their arms around a lot in an entertaining manner.</p><h2>Be social</h2><p>Look, you're not going to make it on your own. The ceremony was designed as a communal experience, so you'll need company. Ideally this company will be real-life and tangible, but if that's not possible you can always machine-gun out your pithy string of observations on Twitter. Failing that, you can anthropomorphise a volleyball like Tom Hanks did in Castaway. He'll appreciate your bon mots, even if nobody else will.</p><h2>Drinking games</h2><p>The traditional response to televised spectaculars looks rather dangerous in this case – the ceremony is on TV for five and a half hours, after all – so proceed with caution. You'll also need a lot of booze if you're going to drink whenever the words \"glorious\", \"spectacle\", \"majestic\" or \"pinnacle\" are used, whenever Huw Edwards looks vaguely like he's losing the will to live, whenever a wacky Fearne Cotton-alike presents a kooky segment from backstage, whenever one of the farm animals defecates on camera, whenever anyone struggles to pronounce the name of a foreign athlete and – just to promote responsible drinking – whenever the Queen looks visibly happy to be there. You're probably safe with that last one.</p><p>There. Now you can enjoy the Olympic opening ceremony the way it was meant be enjoyed – begrudgingly, on a sofa, possibly half drunk. It's how Danny Boyle meant you to watch it.</p>","headline":"How to watch the London Olympic opening ceremony","trailText":"<p><strong>Stuart Heritage: </strong>The BBC coverage goes on for over five hours, so here are some top tips on how to prepare – what bits to focus on, and what to ignore</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/gallery/2012/7/27/1343390194715/Beijing-2008-Olympic-Game-003.jpg","wordcount":"604","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"393687826","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6470660","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Stuart Heritage","internalPageCode":"1779655","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-03T13:50:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/27/how-to-watch-olympic-opening-ceremony","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/27/how-to-watch-olympic-opening-ceremony","tags":[{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/sport-tv","webTitle":"Sport TV","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sport-tv","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/sport-tv","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/danny-boyle","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"culture/tvandradioblog","webTitle":"TV and radio blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/tvandradioblog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stuart-heritage","webTitle":"Stuart Heritage","r2ContributorId":"32922","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749340462/StuartHeritage.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Stuart Heritage writes about film, TV and music for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuart-heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/stuart-heritage","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-393699207","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/gallery/2012/7/27/1343390192178/Beijing-2008-Olympic-Game-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","source":"REUTERS","photographer":"Adrees Latif","altText":"Beijing 2008 Olympic Games opening ceremony","suppliersReference":"OLYPEK515","height":"54","credit":"Adrees Latif/REUTERS","caption":"It's difficult to top the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony's synchronised drummers, but as long as you ignore athletes parade you should be fine.

Lord Coe was showing Princess Anne around his new place with broad sweeps of his arms while John Armitt, the chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority that built the Olympic park looked patrician. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, bumbled out just in time to see the jets with his wife Marina Johnson. Former prime minster John Major, and Scottish first minister Alex Salmond stood centre stage. Ed Miliband, doing<br />nothing to dispel a reputation for awkwardness, stood alone a good five yards along from the rest of them. It was perhaps understandable given the Tory-bias of the balcony. Then Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary arrived, fresh from his bell-ringing blunder, and greeted the Labour leader warmly.

inquiry into allegations that Olympic officials and agents have been caught selling tickets for the London 2012 Games on the black market.</p><p>The IOC has held an emergency meeting of its ruling executive following an undercover newspaper investigation. It has referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission, which could lead to a review of how Olympic tickets are distributed among member countries in the future.</p><p><em>Sunday Times </em>reporters posing as envoys of a Middle Eastern ticket tout claim to have found 27 officials and agents representing 54 countries who were willing to breach the rules on selling tickets. One, from Serbia, offered 1,500 tickets for £80,000, while China's official ticket agency agreed to sell the best seats in the stadiums for up to £6,000 each, according to the newspaper. It also alleges that Spyros Capralos, the president of Greece's Olympic committee, breached regulations.</p><p>The IOC said it has moved \"quickly\" to deal with the allegations. \"After claims that several NOCs [National Olympic Committees] and ATRs [authorised ticket resellers] were reportedly willing to break the rules by offering to buy or sell tickets outside their territory, sell tickets at inflated prices, or sell tickets to unauthorised resellers, the IOC has ordered an immediate inquiry and referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission,\" it said.</p><p>\"The IOC takes these allegations very seriously and has immediately taken the first steps to investigate. Should any irregularities be proven, the organisation will deal with those involved in an appropriate manner. The NOCs are autonomous organisations, but if any of the cases are confirmed the IOC will not hesitate to impose the strongest sanctions.\"</p><p>The IOC said it will take on board any recommendations from the inquiry to improve the way tickets are allocated and sold internationally.</p>","headline":"IOC to investigate 'black market' Olympic tickets","trailText":"Olympic officials and agents accused of offering tickets in breach of the rules","newspaperPageNumber":"15","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/17/1339889823034/The-aquatics-centre-003.jpg","wordcount":"295","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"391744639","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6310919","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Cass Jones","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-17T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1760857","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-19T23:38:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/17/black-market-olymipc-tickets-allegations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/17/black-market-olymipc-tickets-allegations","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/international-olympic-committee","webTitle":"International Olympic Committee","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/international-olympic-committee","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/international-olympic-committee","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/cass-jones","webTitle":"Cass Jones","r2ContributorId":"47865","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/cass-jones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/cass-jones","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/uknews","webTitle":"News","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-391744909","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/17/1339889819259/The-aquatics-centre-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Rex Features","altText":"The aquatics centre","height":"54","credit":"Rex Features","caption":"The aquatics centre at the Olympic Park.

A project twice the size of Heathrow's Terminal 5 was built in half the time and half a billion pounds under budget,\" said Jowell in a speech to the Euroconstruct industry conference.</p><p>\"It was also a success story in terms of the benefit that it brought to the nation. Seventy-five pence in every pound was spent on regeneration. Efforts were made to invest in individuals, with 3,500 training opportunities offered on site, 457 apprenticeships on offer and 11% of the jobs going to the formerly unemployed.\"</p><p>Jowell said the successful construction project, which has helped banish the ghosts of Wembley and the aborted attempt to build a stadium for the world athletics championships at Picketts Lock, held a number of lessons for future major public projects.</p><p>\"The first lesson is that a public-private partnership should seek to create a higher purpose than the bottom line. During the Olympic construction project, this allowed the management to create an ethos that went beyond the simple objectives of the construction project. The focus on regeneration and local benefit not only built better relationships with local residents, but it also created a supportive culture within the workforce that 'failure was not an option' and that everything had to be done to make the project a success,\" she said.</p><p>\"The second lesson is that the employer and trade unions need to be engaged in co-operation rather than confrontation.

The opening scene features real grass, real ploughs, real soil and – said Boyle – real clouds that would supply \"rain\" if there was none in order to ensure an authentically British atmosphere. With no Glastonbury festival this year, the event will be evoked with a replica of Glastonbury Tor and mosh pits at either end of the arena.</p><p>One of those pits will have a Last Night of the Proms theme and the other a festival atmosphere, with around 100 young people in each.</p><p>While the show will open with a rural pastoral vision that evokes William Blake and Jerusalem, it is expected to evolve to take on a more urban hue. Boyle said he would not reveal how the \"puzzle fits together\" and he refused to confirm any of the acts taking part, although Sir Paul McCartney has already confirmed his involvement and the likes of Take That and The Who are also expected to feature.</p><p>But the director underlined that it was not a musical show, but a narrative set to music. The electronic group Underworld have already recorded two lengthy tracks at Abbey Road to score the action. The closing ceremony will be a more traditional celebration of British music.</p><p>Boyle had already revealed that the three-hour opening ceremony would be titled Isles of Wonder, a title based on a speech by Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest that will be referenced throughout the four ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Stephen Daldry, the Billy Elliot director who is overseeing all four ceremonies, said the ceremony was Boyle's \"singular vision\" rather than being developed by committee. In all, the ceremonies will cost £81m – a figure that doubled from the original budget.</p><p>If the jubilee weekend was a festival of pageantry and heritage, it already appears that Boyle's opening ceremony will be a more playful and anarchic treatment of British culture.</p><p>\"You're bound to fail, that's built in. But you hope that on the journey, you hope people will find enough in it to feel that it is representative of us,\" said Boyle.</p><p>He said there would be British humour and that the country's history would be represented but \"not in a box-ticking way\", and the show would reflect \"parts of our heritage but looking forward as well\".</p><p>A troupe of NHS nurses will appear in one sequence, but Boyle said the show would not be overtly political.</p><p>\"This is a festival of celebration of an Olympic ideal. But it's not a naive show. We're trying to show the best of us, but we're also trying to show many different things about our country. The growth of cities is an extraordinary phenomenon that is clearly linked to the growth of the Olympic Games.\"</p><p>The cast and crew, which will number 10,000 once volunteers are taken into account, have one more weekend of rehearsals in Dagenham before moving into the stadium – where the replica of Glastonbury Tor and the giant bell are already in position. There have already been 157 rehearsals.</p><p>The BBC confirmed that it would supply two short films to the opening ceremony and Boyle said it would differ from previous Games in being more cinematic in tone, rather than relying on scale alone.</p><p>\"We're trying to make you feel like you're watching a live film being made,\" said the Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting director. \"It feels like when you're planning a big sequence in a film. We're trying to make it feel like a live recording of a film that all happens on one evening. We're trying to shoot it in a very visceral way.</p><p>One of the major challenges will be keeping the athletes, who will parade around a circuit designed to evoke the M25 or London's north circular road, moving.</p><p>\"There is an hour of culture, then there is the parade of athletes and the lighting of the cauldron and the fireworks. In between that, there is the protocol – the speeches and the raising of the flags. All of that is preceded by the arrival of the head of state,\"</p><p>Boyle said the giant bell, hanging at one end of the stadium, sounded \"absolutely amazing\". It will ring to begin the show.</p><p>\"You will feel different when you're in there and you hear it ring. When you hear it it's very sweet. It's ancient, so it reminds you of the past. It's also timeless, so it evokes the future. That was how communities notified each other something important was about to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Boyle also teased that there would be \"real clouds\" over the stadium.</p><p>\"They will be real clouds that will be hanging over the stadium. Work that out if you can. We know we're an island culture and an island climate. One of these clouds will provide rain on the evening, just in case it doesn't rain.\"</p>","headline":"Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals","trailText":"Director Danny Boyle reveals plans for London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, including village cricket, maypoles and rain<br />","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/12/1339496084154/Olympic-opening-ceremony--003.jpg","wordcount":"893","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"391466427","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6289877","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Gibson, Olympics editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1758359","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-15T10:33:11Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/danny-boyle","references":[]},{"id":"culture/cultural-olympiad","webTitle":"Cultural Olympiad","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682482177/Owen-Gibson.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

Something between a pageant, a procession, a theatre show, a concert and a film. It contains diplomacy, politics, flag-waving (literally), sport and art. None of these are easy bedfellows, but one feels that in Danny Boyle's confident hands, the London Games curtain-raiser has a strong chance of melding those disparate elements into something intimate as well as spectacular, edgy as well as celebratory, funny as well as grand. It may even be moving.</p><p>If the bucolic vision of rolling hills, a cricket match, 70 sheep, horses, ducks, cows and actual ploughing that Boyle has unveiled seems a little English and pastoral, rather than British and urban, I predict that surprises will be in store. From this opening scene – intended to invoke a \"mythic landscape\", presumably on to which the actor Mark Rylance will appear to proclaim that \"the isle is full of noises\" – a \"thematic narrative\" will evolve, Boyle said, devised with the writer Frank Cottrell Boyce. According to the ceremonies' executive producer, Stephen Daldry, the narrative will invoke \"who we were, who we are and what we will be\". Both Boyle and Daldry used the word visceral.</p><p>The terrifying splendour of the Beijing opening ceremony, with its massed ranks of highly disciplined participants, still looms large in the memory. Reading between the lines of Boyle's cryptic remarks (not unreasonably, he wants the detail of the event to unfold \"like a puzzle\" on the day), the British event will be small as well as big; invoke the individual as well as the collective; and have a touch of anarchy amid the tightly controlled choreography. He described the ceremony as like a film that will be shot live – crucially, using not only wide angles but also close-ups.</p><p>There may be tremendous spectacle and glamour (clouds emitting rain on demand in the event that nature fails to provide; exciting aerial work from the wire strung across the stadium), but I suspect that some moments will zero in on lone figures. At the same time, Boyle is keen to make the event feel communal and inclusive, hence the two audience-filled pits beneath the twin stages, which have been dubbed the moshpit and the posh pit: one is intended to recall the audience at Glastonbury; the other reflects the other the crowd at the Last Night of the Proms. Boyle said these people would be drawn into the action of the event: \"You will feel very involved.\"</p><p>The key to the success or failure of the ceremony is whether Boyle's integrity of vision has been allowed to remain unsullied or turns out to have been diluted by the dead hand of the committee. Boyle spoke of the many representations he had had, not just from officials but from strangers grabbing him on the tube to pass on their ideas. He had been doing a lot of listening, he said, but also noted that whatever he did he was bound to fail, to an extent: there was no way that everyone's idea of Britain could be realised.</p><p>With luck, Boyle will have clung on to the spikiness and wit that characterises his work, alongside his gift for the spectacular visual moments that were a such an enjoyable feature of Slumdog Millionaire. He admitted that some aspects of British humour might be lost on overseas viewers, but said: \"I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us.\" If he manages that, he will have pulled off the job.</p>","headline":"London 2012 opening ceremony promises spectacle and surprises","trailText":"<p><strong>Charlotte Higgins: </strong>Danny Boyle has been doing a lot of listening, but it is crucial his integrity of vision is allowed to remain unsullied</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/12/1339512227746/Olympic-opening-ceremony-003.jpg","wordcount":"589","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"391485732","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6291388","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Charlotte Higgins, chief arts writer","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1758586","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-15T14:49:41Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-opening-ceremony-spectacle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-opening-ceremony-spectacle","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"culture/cultural-olympiad","webTitle":"Cultural Olympiad","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/cultural-olympiad","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"culture/charlottehigginsblog","webTitle":"Charlotte Higgins on culture","description":"Charlotte Higgins tours the UK and blogs on the latest developments in the arts, classical music, theatre and books","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/danny-boyle","references":[]},{"id":"profile/charlottehiggins","webTitle":"Charlotte Higgins","rcsId":"GNL465906","r2ContributorId":"15476","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749330213/CharlotteHiggins.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736088/CharlotteHiggins.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Charlotte Higgins is the chief arts writer of the Guardian.

But aren't the Games about more than just us?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:01:29Z","body":"<p>Patriotism becomes daft when you expect other countries to share your national pride. America nearly got away with it in the age of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/moonlandings/\" title=\"\">moon landings</a>, when children of my generation accepted it as fair enough for the stars and stripes to hang out there in space. But it has been <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colaadv.html\" title=\"\">a long time since even the land of Coke could teach the world to sing</a>. Why should the entire world be expected to embrace the British self-love that appears to be at the heart of the Olympics opening ceremony? Are we offering ourselves as the new America, a land so marvellous it can export its self-image?</p><p>A billion people around the planet are expected to witness the £27m ceremony conceived by film director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a> to start the Games. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">In details announced today</a>, it emerges that he will turn the stadium into a vast model of an ideal and somewhat mythic British countryside. Complete with landmarks like Glastonbury Tor and entitled Green and Pleasant, the spectacle will treat the world to a romantic vision of our national landscape. Real farmyard animals will be grazing; in total there will be 70 sheep, 12 horses, three cows, two goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, nine geese and three sheepdogs. There will also be clouds with fake rain in case the night is clear. \"If it doesn't rain, we have created our own,\" said Boyle at the announcement, pointing to four huge clouds hanging from wires over a model of the stadium.</p><p>Look, I am not a huge athletics fan. Sometimes I watch the Olympics on TV, sometimes I don't. Is it the done thing to obsess about one's own national identity quite so overtly in the opening ceremony? By the sound of it, though, Boyle's spectacle will be far from complacent: with references to the aftermath of the industrial revolution and a cast that includes NHS nurses, it does sound as though he is offering an alternative, radical style of patriotism, not to mention laughing at national traits and the soggy climate. But radical navel-gazing is navel-gazing nonetheless.</p><p>There seems to be a unfortunate blur between this summer's jubilee and the Olympics. It is a culmination of a boom in self-regard that has made modern Britain ever more inward-looking. Waving flags for the jubilee was logical: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154671/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-Crowd-500-000-flag-waving-royalists-cheered-sang-danced-night-Britain-showed-world-party.html\" title=\"\">the Queen is nothing if not British</a>. But the Olympics? Surely, the Games are international.</p><p>The British Museum in London currently has <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2012/winning_at_the_ancient_games.aspx\" title=\"\">a modest display of 12 objects recalling the ancient Greek Olympics</a>. The highlight – which no one who visits London this summer should miss – is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurendill/422021748/\" title=\"\">Motya Charioteer</a>, one of the masterpieces of ancient Greek art. Contemplating this sensuous statue of an athlete in a clinging robe, I could not help wishing the British Museum would put on a full-scale show about the history of the Olympics to celebrate us hosting the world's greatest sporting event. Instead, its big exhibition for the Olympic summer, in the same flag-waving mood as Boyle's sceptred-isle landscape, will be about <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/shakespeare_staging_the_world.aspx\" title=\"\">Shakespeare</a>. I am looking forward to it. But then I am British.</p><p>Is Britain playing host to the world this summer – or to itself? Why on Earth is the romantic Little England of Boyle's opener the appropriate way to begin a festival celebrating the human planet?</p><p>There's something very 1930s about all this. When we remember the Depression, we see the vicious hyper-nationalism of Hitler and Mussolini as nightmares never to be repeated – yet democratic countries too became inward-looking and self-obsessed in that age of austerity. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-piper-1774\" title=\"\">British artists harped on about the landscape</a>. <a href=\"http://www.pgwodehousesociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Novelists feasted on British eccentricity</a>. Now, in this new age of austerity, imaginations are once more preoccupied with homegrown qualities and known landscapes. Isn't the Olympics meant to be bigger and more generous than that?</p>","headline":"The Olympics are exposing Britain as a self-obsessed nation","trailText":"<strong>Jonathan Jones: </strong>Plans for the opening ceremony are to be a mixture of celebration and gentle jibes about our nation.

The other members of the team are expected to be William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Tina Cook and Piggy French, who won last year's test event in Greenwich.</p><p>Phillips' chances of making the Games had been virtually written off following the retirement of Toytown last year, but she boosted her selection chances when she came third at Bramham Horse Trials on High Kingdom.</p><p>Phillips won the 2006 world championships on Toytown, and was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year the following December. However, injuries to the horse in 2004 and 2008 meant that she never competed in an Olympic Games.</p><p>The news will doubtless please many of those with tickets to watch the eventing in Greenwich Park, as well as Olympic sponsor Samsung. Along with David Beckham, who is expected to make the Team GB football squad, she acts as an ambassador for the electronics brand.</p><p>Her new mount, which she has ridden sporadically throughout her career, is not considered to be in the same class as Toytown. But after finishing third at Bramham, she spoke of High Kingdom's rapid improvement and that, combined with her experience as a rider in major competitions, is likely to have tipped the balance in her favour.</p><p>Phillips, who is married to former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, said: \"It's awesome to be given this opportunity.</p><p>\"I am really excited and can't wait to kick on and get him there. Hopefully, we will make it this time.\"</p><p>Phillips's mother, Princess Anne, competed in the 1976 Olympic Games as a member of the British team in Montreal on the Queen's horse Goodwill. As a representative on the International Olympic Committee, she was a vocal advocate of the campaign to bring the Games to London. Phillips's father, Captain Mark Phillips, won a gold medal in 1972 and a silver in 1988.</p><p>A BOA spokesman said: \"I can't comment on who has been selected until the team has been officially announced later this week.\"</p><p>Phillips will take one of five slots on the eventing team in a sport expected to deliver medals for Team GB.</p><p>Part of the rationale for holding the equestrian events in central London in Greenwich Park as opposed to a venue further from the athletes' village is to appeal to spectators and TV viewers who have not considered watching it before.</p><p>The presence of the 13th in line to the throne in eventing competition is only likely to add to the interest and anticipation around an event that was among the first to sell out when tickets went on sale last year.</p><p>• This article was amended on 12 June 2012 to make clear that it was Zara Phillips's father, not Princess Anne's, who won Olympic medals in 1972 and 1988.</p>","headline":"Zara Phillips to compete in 2012 Olympics","trailText":"<p>Queen's granddaughter will compete in Greenwich Park this summer as part of the British equestrian team</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/11/1339445302193/Zara-Phillips-Competes-In-004.jpg","wordcount":"544","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"391447200","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6288621","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Gibson, Olympics editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-12T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1758223","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-14T20:10:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/11/zara-phillips-compete-2012-olympics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/11/zara-phillips-compete-2012-olympics","tags":[{"id":"sport/zara-phillips","webTitle":"Zara Phillips","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/zara-phillips","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/zara-phillips","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012-equestrian","webTitle":"Olympics 2012: equestrian","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-equestrian","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012-equestrian","references":[]},{"id":"sport/equestrianism","webTitle":"Equestrianism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/equestrianism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/equestrianism","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682482177/Owen-Gibson.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

What have I missed here?' Cook said. \"It was getting closer to the Olympics and I was thinking 'this is not right'.</p><p>\"I emailed the performance manager and asked to be let known what was going on because I had not received any information. I got one back saying it was to do with not giving your email address and phone number – and I said 'you must be joking'.</p><p>\"I have had constant emails, text messages and phone calls from the performance manager, I was part of the team who have been there for six years. They have got my phone number. I said 'no way are you going to do it on a technicality like that'.</p><p>\"Basically they have broken their own process. The process is that everybody is supposed to have the emails about rankings and also they are supposed to say 'have you got anything else you want to add to your case for Olympic selection?'</p><p>\"I can't argue about who they have picked because it is discretionary places, but they did not give me a chance and did not follow the process of Olympic selection.\"</p><p>British Fencing maintains its selection process is transparent and robust. The communications director, David King, said in a statement: \"British Fencing strongly denies any bias or inappropriate action in the non-selection of Keith Cook for a discretionary Home Nation place at the London 2012 Olympics.</p><p>\"British Fencing has fully supported Mr Cook in his Olympic ambitions, selecting him for every international competition where he met the qualifying standard and choosing him to participate in the Olympic test event in November.</p><p>\"Like the other 25 athletes in contention for an Olympic spot, Mr Cook would have been fully aware of what was required to achieve consideration.</p><p>\"At the time of selection Mr Cook was in 19th position across all athletes and weapons for eight host nation places. He was the sixth highest-rated men's foilist with a world ranking of 94.</p><p>\"We certainly understand the disappointment that any athlete feels when devoting one's life to training and working to achieve a goal like this and coming short.</p><p>\"While we regret that Mr Cook has felt it necessary to make these statements, British Fencing will continue to support Mr Cook's future ambitions.\"</p><p>There was some controversy surrounding the individual squad announcement at the start of June, with only two of the seven fencers having qualified by right.</p><p>King, though, added: \"We have made what we think are the best decisions, both for 2012 and 2016. We have a good squad and it is time for everyone to get behind them and let's go forward.\"</p>","headline":"London 2012: Keith Cook appeals against omission from GB fencing team","trailText":"The Scottish fencer Keith Cook has questioned the selection procedures for the GB fencing team","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/11/1339452556691/British-Fencing-003.jpg","wordcount":"671","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"391450755","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6287668","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Press Association","internalPageCode":"1758252","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-14T23:01:06Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympics-fencing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympics-fencing","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012-fencing","webTitle":"Olympics 2012: fencing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-fencing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012-fencing","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-gb","webTitle":"Team GB","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-gb","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-gb","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"sport/fencing","webTitle":"Fencing","description":"The latest news and comment on fencing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/fencing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/fencing","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-391450940","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/11/1339452553238/British-Fencing-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Tom Jenkins","photographer":"Tom Jenkins","altText":"British Fencing","height":"54","credit":"Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","caption":"British Fencing have selected a seven-strong squad for the Olympics which does not include Keith Cook.

Their biggest star was the heavyweight Teófilo Stevenson, who has died after suffering from heart disease aged 60. Stevenson was the second boxer, after the Hungarian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/18/guardianobituaries.boxing\" title=\"\">László Papp</a>, and the first heavyweight, to become a three-time Olympic gold medallist. (His fellow Cuban heavyweight Félix Savón has since accomplished the same feat.)</p><p>Stevenson famously turned down a potential million-dollar payday for a fight against Muhammad Ali, which would have been billed as an epic confrontation between American democracy and Soviet-style communism. \"What is a million dollars,\" asked Stevenson, \"compared to the love of eight million Cubans?\" The match would have been intriguing; tall, handsome and formidable, with a seemingly unmarked face, Stevenson was the amateur Ali. But he was rarely tested by the three-round amateur bouts.</p><p>I was at the Montreal Forum in 1976 when Stevenson won his second Olympic gold medal. His opponent, the Romanian Mircea Simon, was respectful of Stevenson's dominance and edged warily around the ring for two rounds, landing the occasional long-range jab, to the delight of his corner. In the third and final round, he tried to land a punch. Stevenson deployed a powerful right-handed counter, and SSimon's corner threw the towel into the ring immediately.</p><p>Stevenson was born in Cuba's eastern Las Tunas province. His father was an immigrant from Saint Vincent; his mother was a first-generation Cuban whose parents had come from Saint Kitts. Big for his age, and otherwise seemingly unfocused, he began sparring seriously at nine and by his early teens, coached by John Herrera, had won his first junior title.</p><p>Soon he was training in Havana under the Soviet coach Andrei Chervonenko, who began teaching him the style perfected in eastern Europe to take advantage of amateur scoring, which counted all punches landed equally. Combined with the more professional style he had already learned, Stevenson quickly established himself. He lost in the national finals at 17 and won bronze at the Pan American Games in 1971, after losing to the highly touted American Duane Bobick.</p><p>At the 1972 Munich Olympics, Stevenson and Bobick met in the quarter-finals, in what was probably the greatest fight of Stevenson's career. The fight went into the decisive third round, and he won after putting Bobick down three times. Stevenson then easily won his semi-final, and he took the gold when Romania's Ion Alexe withdrew due to injury. This began Stevenson's unprecedented run of domination in the amateur ranks. He won the 1974 World Championships before a wildly partisan crowd in Havana and the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico City before his Olympic victory in Montreal. These were heady times for Cuban sport –  Stevenson and the athlete Alberto  Juantorena were arguably the biggest stars of the 1976 Olympics.</p><p>Stevenson's only losses during this time came in dual meets with the Soviets, in 1973 and 1976, to <a href=\"http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=9323&amp;more=1\" title=\"\">Igor Vysotsky</a>, but he won further World, Pan American and Olympic titles, the latter achieved in Moscow in 1980. His streak ended at the 1982 World Championships, with a loss to Italy's Francesco Damiani, but he would likely have won a fourth Olympic gold had Cuba not boycotted the 1984 Games in Los Angeles; Stevenson had beaten Tyrell Biggs, who won the Olympic gold, in a Cuba-US dual meet before the Games.</p><p>Stevenson won the 1986 World title at super-heavyweight, but retired in 1988 after another Cuban boycott – this time of the Seoul Olympics – cost him another chance for a fourth gold. He ended his career with 302 wins and only 22 losses. Stevenson then lived in relative luxury in Havana. He became a coach with the national team, and rose to the vice-presidency of the national boxing federation. It was while travelling with the national team from a match against the US in 1999 that he was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/sports/plus-boxing-stevenson-of-cuba-arrested-in-miami.html\" title=\"\">arrested at Miami airport</a>, accused of headbutting an airline employee. Released on bail, he returned to Havana, and never faced trial, but said that he had been provoked by Cuban exiles in Miami, because he was an internationally successful Cuban sports figure.</p><p>In January this year, Stevenson was hospitalised with a blood clot. He was gladdened by the outpouring of support he received from around the globe – \"even from Miami,\" he said.</p><p>He is survived by two children.</p><p><em> </em>• Teófilo Stevenson, boxer, born 29 March 1952; died 11 June 2012</p>","headline":"Teófilo Stevenson obituary","trailText":"Cuban heavyweight and three-time Olympic gold medallist who turned down  the chance to fight Muhammad Ali","newspaperPageNumber":"24","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/12/1339511188848/Te-filo-Stevenson-003.jpg","wordcount":"746","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"391484336","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6290788","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Michael Carlson","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1758571","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-15T14:29:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/teofilo-stevenson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/12/teofilo-stevenson","tags":[{"id":"sport/boxing","webTitle":"Boxing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/boxing","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michael-carlson","webTitle":"Michael Carlson","r2ContributorId":"35018","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-carlson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/michael-carlson","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/cuba","webTitle":"Cuba","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/cuba","references":[]},{"id":"world/fidel-castro","webTitle":"Fidel Castro","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/fidel-castro","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-391485000","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/12/1339511186526/Te-filo-Stevenson-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","altText":"Teófilo Stevenson","height":"54","credit":"AP","caption":"Teófilo Stevenson takes on Soviet opponent Pyotr Zaev to win the heavyweight bout at the Moscow Olympics in 1980.
