The danger of armed clashes across mutual borders is rising too.</p><p>The incident also highlights the grim lesson that armed conflicts usually intensify when peace negotiations are on the agenda. All sides ramped up their offensives in the run-up to and during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/syrian-regime-and-opposition-begin-new-round-of-talks-in-geneva\" title=\"\">Geneva talks on Syria</a> in January and February, in the hope that military advances would give them stronger bargaining power. That&nbsp;lethal momentum has not slowed.</p><p>At the weekend western-supported rebels, along with their jihadist allies, the al-Nusra front, seemed to have captured Kasab – the last border crossing to Turkey still controlled by Bashar al-Assad's forces. The Syrian warplane's bombing runs were part of Assad's counter-attack. In nearby clashes on the ground the president's cousin, Hilal al-Assad – a&nbsp;leader of the National Defence Force militia – was killed on Sunday.</p><p>Elsewhere in the north, Syrian forces are slowly managing to capture rebel-held ground around the divided city of Aleppo, and might soon surround it. Meanwhile the US is stepping up its&nbsp;arms supplies to opposition fighters on the southern Jordanian front.</p><p>The government's indiscriminate artillery and air attacks on rebel parts of&nbsp;Aleppo, and the villages that lie north of it, have produced a huge surge of refugees. In the Turkish border town of&nbsp;Kilis, aid officials told me that a camp they help just inside Syria hosted 10,000 refugees at the beginning of this year. Now it hosts 50,000.</p><p>Turkey has shouldered an amazing burden, virtually without complaint. Kilis has a Turkish population of 80,000. Almost 40,000 Syrians now live there as well. Some are there because they are not given space in any of the three local camps. Others prefer a flat, at least until their funds for rent run out. Many are then forced to risk going back to Syria. At the border I approached four families at random. Two were returning to Aleppo. Abu Mohammed cradled a three-month-old baby in his arms. His burqa-clad wife stood a few yards off as he said: \"We left Aleppo four days ago because of fierce bombing night after night. We're thinking of going back because at least we have our own home and it's not yet destroyed.\"</p><p>Abu Omar was standing beside massive piles of suitcases, bulging black plastic bags and rolled up mattresses. His wife was sitting on one of the piles, their four children beside her. They had been in Kilis for four months, he said. Their home village of al-Bab recently fell under the control of fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (which is in constant conflict with other rebel groups), and&nbsp;they had heard that clashes were over and it was safe to return.</p><p>Syria's war is a strategic stalemate that no side can win, but the ebb and flow of the battlelines creates waves of misery that confront civilian families every day with the need to make life-and-death decisions about staying, moving or returning. The wrong choice can be fatal.</p><p>Hoping for a resumption of the Geneva talks seems futile, as the chief&nbsp;UN negotiator, Lakhdar Brahimi, acknowledged on Monday. The west's shrill and short-sighted reaction to Russia's takeover of Crimea has poisoned relations with the Kremlin and undermined any chance of US-Russian co-operation over Syria for several months at least. It will also have reinforced the Kremlin's determination not to see Assad toppled. Similarly, the west's refusal to invite Iran to join the Geneva process remains in force, and this only increases Tehran's support for Assad.</p><p>So the picture is bleaker by the day. The view among analysts in Turkey, as well as among Syrian refugees I talked to, is that this horrendous war could last&nbsp;another five or even 10 years.</p><p><em>Jonathan Steele is a former chief foreign correspondent for the Guardian</em></p>","headline":"The Syria conflict has lethal momentum","trailText":"<p><strong>Jonathan Steele:</strong> Bloodshed, not just refugees, is crossing the border from Syria – and the picture gets bleaker by the day</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395751490113/Free-Syrian-Army-is-repor-006.jpg","wordcount":"650","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T07:29:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/26/syria-conflict-lethal-momentum-bloodshed-refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/26/syria-conflict-lethal-momentum-bloodshed-refugees","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/refugees","webTitle":"Refugees","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/14/1326543075769/Guardian-Open-Weekend-Jon-002.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

That rebel attack led to the killing of around 200 civilians, an act <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/10/10/syria-executions-hostage-taking-rebels\" title=\"\">labelled a war crime by Human Rights Watch</a> and other international observers.</p><p>Rebel groups, among them the jihadist Jabhat al-Nusra, say they are trying to reach the Mediterranean coast, where they hope to open a supply line, a difficult thing to achieve with the Syrian military maintaining dominance over air and sea.</p><p>Regime warplanes continued to bomb opposition positions on Tuesday, two days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/turkey-shoots-down-syrian-plane\" title=\"\">Turkey downed a Syrian jet which it claimed had flown into its air space</a> while on bombing runs near the border.</p><p>Syrian television reported on Tuesday that the pilot of the downed jet had been received on Monday as a hero in his home village near Hama, 60 miles south of the latest fighting.</p><p>The downing of the Syrian jet marked the third aerial clash between the two former allies since an uprising against Assad began in March 2011. Syria shot down a Turkish jet in 2012, and Turkey downed a Syrian helicopter last year. All three clashes have been in the same bitterly contested corner of the war ravaged country.</p><p>Opposition groups have mounted several offensives in northern Syria after ousting radical jihadist fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq in Sham (Isis) over three months of brutal battles.</p><p>Isis had maintained a stronghold in the northern Latakia region. Its influence spread across the countryside and into Aleppo, Syria's largest city. However, the recent battles have seen the group retreat to the town of al-Bab, just east of Aleppo, from where it controls much of eastern Syria and Anbar province in Iraq.</p><p>The opposition is now in control of the Kassab border crossing to Turkey, and the Armenian Christian town of the same name.</p><p>Attacks on the Alawite areas to the east have so far been sporadic; however, a cousin of the Syrian president, Hilal al-Assad, was killed on Sunday in a nearby village, apparently by a rebel rocket attack.</p><p>Assad led a local unit of the National Defence Front (NDF), a loyalist group drawn mainly from the Alawite sect, which is deployed in large numbers in the area. The NDF, the Syrian military, and an Iraqi militia, Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas, are also defending the area.</p><p>The renewed fighting in the north has been matched by relative quiet elsewhere in Syria. Battered forces from both sides appear to have drawn breath in Damascus and the south. And regime forces continue mopping-up operations in the Qalamoun mountains near Lebanon, where Hezbollah and regime troops last week succeeded in ousting opposition groups after more than four months of brutal fighting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, one of two main backers of the Syrian opposition, on Tuesday said the world had betrayed Syria's rebels. Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz said the Syrian crisis was a catastrophe, and called for \"changing the balance of forces\" on the ground.</p><p>A central driver of the war, which has killed in excess of 150,000 people and displaced up to nine million, is a battle for influence between Saudia Arabia and Iran, which has staunchly backed the Assad regime throughout the crisis.</p>","headline":"Bashar al-Assad's home village under threat from Syrian opposition forces","trailText":"Second sustained attack mounted on area around Qardaha, as government troops protect Syrian leader's ancestral village.","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395774478196/Clashes-in-Kasab-town-006.jpg","wordcount":"611","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T19:30:52Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/bashar-al-assad-home-village-syrian-opposition-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/25/bashar-al-assad-home-village-syrian-opposition-attack","tags":[{"id":"world/bashar-al-assad","webTitle":"Bashar al-Assad","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/bashar-al-assad","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-chulov","webTitle":"Martin Chulov","r2ContributorId":"29038","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290791972910/martin-chulov.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Chulov covers the Middle East for the Guardian.

I'm not listening,\" he said to cheers.</p><p>Erdogan, tackling a corruption scandal that could damage his AK party at local polls next Sunday, used a speech in the western city of Izmit also to announce Turkish forces had shot down a Syrian fighter that had crossed into Turkish air space.</p><p>Supporters waved red Turkish flags and blue and gold emblems of the AK party he founded in 2001 and led to power a year later, vowing to root out the corruption that had dogged rivals.</p><p>Western nations and rights groups have<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\" title=\"\"> accused Turkey of intolerance for closing down the Twitter networking site </a>over anonymously posted audio tapes that implicate Erdogan in graft. Erdogan says tapes of phone conversations had been manipulated as part of a smear campaign.</p><p>\"The usual media are attacking us. What do they call it? 'Intolerance of freedoms',\" he said. \"I don't care who it is, I'm not listening. Even if the world stands up against us, I am obliged to take measure against every attack that threatens my nation's security.</p><p>\"This entity called Twitter, this YouTube, this Facebook, they have shaken families to their roots...I don't understand how people of good sense could defend this Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. There are all kinds of lies there.\"</p><p>Erdogan accuses Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally who helped him drive reforms including the taming of the armed forces, of leading a campaign to blacken his name and topple him. At a campaign speech on Saturday he described Gulen's network, which has influence in the police and judiciary, as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>The dramatic power struggle that has broken out between Erdogan and Gulen has undermined western perceptions of N member Turkey as an exemplary Muslim democracy and a possible anchor of stability in the Middle East.</p><p></p><p>Erdogan, his picture shown on banners across the country, draws heavily on his image as the strong leader Turkey has long lacked. His supporters still cherish the idea, while many critics feel strength has mutated to authoritarianism.</p><p>With familiar flourish Erdogan announced to the crowd Turkish forces had shot down a Syrian plane</p><p>\"A Syrian plane violated our airspace … Our F-16s took off and hit this plane. Why? Because if you violate my airspace, our slap after this will be hard.\"</p><p>Rebels have been fighting for control of the Kasab crossing, the border region, since Friday, when they launched an offensive which Syrian authorities say was backed by Turkey's military.</p><p>Syria said Turkish air defences shot down the jet while it was attacking rebel forces inside Syrian territory, calling the move a \"blatant aggression\".</p><p>While Erdogan spoke in Kocaeli, hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered on the shores on the Sea of Marmara in Istanbul on the approaches to the Bosphorus strait for what will be the climax of the electoral campaign.</p><p>Next Sunday's vote could yet decide the future of a man who at first won plaudits in the west and Middle East for his economic success and reforming drive, but has more recently come under heavy criticism as, in the eyes of many, an authoritarian, increasingly intolerant leader.</p><p>Not that all would share that view or be swayed by the accusations of corruption against him and his party. Erdogan remains by far the most popular politician and hopes to match or exceed the 40% vote AK received at local polls in 2009.</p><p>There is widespread expectation of further postings intended to damage Erdogan, who denies all graft accusations. These could emerge ahead of the local polls, where any result significantly below 40% could undermine his position and his prospects of election to a powerful presidency later this year.</p><p>But they could also emerge during the presidential election period itself. There is no open sign of any move against Erdogan in the AK party but a poor result next week could revive concern that emerged over his hard line against protesters last summer.</p><p>Ultimately, much could hinge on the opposition regaining the leadership and momentum it has lacked since 2002. Then, Erdogan drew on public anger over corruption in Turkey's old political elite, naming his new party AK, an acronym for justice and development, but also a word meaning clean or white.</p>","headline":"Erdogan tells critics: 'I'm not listening'","trailText":"Turkish PM announces shooting down of Syrian jet in speech on plans to 'take measure against every attack' on national security","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/23/1395590781302/Turkeys-PM-Erdogan--004.jpg","wordcount":"713","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T16:08:27Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/erdogan-turkey-election-speech-syria-jet-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/23/erdogan-turkey-election-speech-syria-jet-attack","tags":[{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432783267","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/23/1395590778188/Turkeys-PM-Erdogan--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Murad Sezer","altText":"Turkey's PM Erdogan ","height":"54","credit":"Murad Sezer/Reuters","caption":"Erdogan is tackling a corruption scandal that could damage his AK party at local polls next Sunday.

But be wary of assuming the net is always a liberating force","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Here we go again: authoritarian ruler finds that social media are making life uncomfortable for him in the run-up to elections; finds Twitter particularly annoying; instructs local authorities to shut off access for his citizens; announces that he is unbothered by international criticism of this act of censorship which, he says, will demonstrate the power of his republic.</p><p>Welcome to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\" title=\"\">Turkey</a>, our staunch ally in the fight against jihad and the Forces of Darkness. There is a certain grim familiarity in the story of Prime Minister Erdogan's battle against social media. He leads the AKP, the \"justice and development party\", that has been in power since 2002. It's now in its third term, having been returned in 2011 with just under half of the popular vote, but Erdogan rules as though he had the 99.9% share beloved of strong leaders everywhere.</p><p>Last December, in the course of a corruption investigation, Turkish police arrested <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/twitter-ban-erdogan-bringing-down-democracy-in-turkey-24643\" title=\"\">scores of people</a>, including three cabinet members and some of their offspring. The accusations of sleaze and corruption which lay behind the arrests are particularly annoying for a prime minister whose party lists \"fighting against corruption\" as one of its main goals.</p><p>Erdogan's response to the prosecution followed the authoritarian rule book to the letter: the prosecutors in charge of the investigation were summarily fired, as were a large number of police officers. A compliant parliament then amended the law to hand powers hitherto exercised by judges and prosecutors over to the justice minister. And it has also passed a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26311770\" title=\"\">new law</a> giving the authorities extensive powers to monitor internet use in Turkey.</p><p>In the old days, given that Erdogan seems to have control of Turkey's mainstream media, that would have been job done. But Twitter turned out to be a real thorn in his side, because links to leaked audio recordings of wiretapped phone conversations between journalists, business people and cabinet ministers were being regularly tweeted.</p><p>So in the end Erdogan's patience snapped and he lashed out. Turkey's telecommunications department announced that a \"protection measure\" had been taken for Twitter, \"according to Decision Nr dated 03.20.2014 of Istanbul Public Prosecutor (Article 10 With TMK Guard).\" You can guess what happened. Within seconds the ban was being openly flouted, circumvented and ridiculed, both within Erdogan's fiefdom and abroad. Twitter rapidly provided instructions (in both English and Turkish) on how to tweet using SMS. (\"Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 255.\") Many Turkish people <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/20/how-to-tweet-from-turkey/\" title=\"\">circumvented the ban</a> either by changing their DNS settings or by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p><p>EU Commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/neelie-kroes\" title=\"\">Neelie Kroes</a> tweeted that \"The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.\" And from Thursday evening onwards <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/21/twitter-ban-turkey-graffiti/\" title=\"\">graffiti </a>began appearing on buildings in Istanbul giving instruction about the new DNS settings that would circumvent the ban. Erdogan has become a laughing stock in less than a week.</p><p>So: authoritarian ruler nil, internet 1? Maybe, but it's really only a half-time score. It would be unwise to extrapolate too far from this little spat. Some commentators were quick to draw comparisons between Erdogan's Twitter ban and Hosni Mubarak's decision during the uprising against his rule to shut off Egypt's access to the net.</p><p>That particular experiment in isolationism ended after five days, and even today it's not clear why. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/02/mubaraks-digital-dilemma-why-egypts-internet-controls-failed/\" title=\"\">Some argue</a> that the regime's U-turn was forced by the realisation of the Egyptian military that their vast commercial interests were being harmed by the ban; others argue that the closure had the counter-productive effect of encouraging even more people on to the streets to find out what was going on.</p><p>In that context, it's even possible that Erdogan knew what he was doing. In a perceptive blog <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/paul-mason-blog/reasons-turkeys-twitter-ban-matters-world/587#more-587\" title=\"\">post</a> on the Twitter decision, for example, Paul Mason argues that the ban may have been a gambit \"designed to force the secular, young and leftist opposition on to the streets during the election, boosting the turnout of their opponents, the conservative Islamist masses\".</p><p>Even so, Mason sees Erdogan's ploy as just the latest indication of a deeper trend. \"This is not about Turkey,\" he says, \"it's about the right to be modern.\" The ageing elites of the pre-internet age he says are slowly realising what young people are born knowing: you can't turn off the social media without turning off modernity and economic life.</p><p>The workaround Turkish tweeters are using exploits the fundamental strength of the internet: it is a network of networks, containing non-hierarchical pathways that simply do not allow you to switch part of it off. This is a signal moment in that process: a moment where a once-respected statesman turns into a Canute-like clown.\"</p><p>There is a whiff of technological determinism about this that makes me uneasy. Ever since the internet appeared on the scene in the 1980s the really big question that it posed was whether it would prove a powerful enough force to overthrow the established order.</p><p>Would the central elements of that order – the state, transnational corporations, military and hierarchical institutions generally – be \"disintermediated\", dissolved or bypassed by this new decentralised, empowering, liberating, democratising technology?</p><p>The honest answer is that it's too early to say. There have, of course, been some heartwarming examples of how the corrupt old order has been discombobulated and outmanoeuvred by the technology and its resourceful users. But in the last decade we have also seen how the internet has been commandeered by the established order – for example in the way the NSA and GCHQ have turned it into an Orwellian dream machine, and in the way the Chinese have invented a new form of tech-savvy governance – what the internet freedom campaigner Rebecca Mackinnon named <a href=\"http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/6349/MacKinnon_Libtech.pdf\" title=\"\">\"networked authoritarianism\"</a>.</p><p>Erdogan may or may not be a clown, but he's not really a serious player in this particular game. And hubris is a luxury that only fools can afford.</p>","headline":"As Turkey's Erdogan has discovered,  you can't turn off Twitter","trailText":"<p><strong>John Naughton: </strong>Users easily circumvented Erdogan's Twitter ban.

Erdogan blames social media for helping to publicise leaked tapes allegedly linking him to a corruption scandal that has rocked his government. He has threatened similar action against YouTube and Facebook. \"This thing called social media is currently the worst menace to society,\" he declared last year during nationwide demonstrations against his increasingly authoritarian rule. Announcing his Twitter ban, he said: \"The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all.\" In the event, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\" title=\"\">Twitter use rose 138%</a> in 24 hours as users easily circumvented his ban.</p><p>Foolish or not, it would be daft to dismiss Erdogan. His self-confidence is impressive. After three consecutive general election victories and more than 10 years in power, when Turkey's economy grew by 5%, per capita productivity almost doubled, and its regional influence expanded, Erdogan seems to think he has a right to rule. But the shine has gone off his leadership in the past 12 months. His strong leader image has been supplanted, for many, by that of bad-tempered bully.</p><p>The immediate spark for the Twitter furore is local elections due a week today, viewed as a key test of Erdogan's enduring appeal. He has been campaigning hard, rallying the rural and urban working-class voters who care little for social media and corruption scandals, but like the ruling AKP's trademark handouts and subsidies. On these results may depend Erdogan's expected run for the presidency in August.</p><p>But additional obstacles loom. One is the now open hostility of the influential Sunni cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whose opposition has split Erdogan's conservative base. Another is Turkey's popular president, Abdullah Gul, whom Erdogan hopes to replace. Gul is showing signs of independence. He reacted to the Twitter ban by publicly deploring it – on Twitter. And Gul is no fool.</p>","headline":"Erdogan's shabby attempts to stifle his critics are doomed","trailText":"<p><strong>Observer editorial: </strong>Recep Tayyip Erdogan's attempted ban on Twitter

Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's birthday present to the social media giant, and to millions of Turks who use it daily, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\" title=\"Guardian: Turkey blocks use of Twitter after prime minister attacks social media site\">was to block the site</a>. At about 11.20pm last night, those who wanted to use Twitter were greeted by a message from the Telecommunications Presidency referencing a court order that blocked access to it.</p><p>Within minutes, detailed methods of bypassing the block by changing DNS numbers and using VPNs were shared via Facebook, WhatsApp and text message. Hashtags using the Turkish for \"Twitter Is Blocked in Turkey\", \"Turkey Blocked Twitter\" and \"Dictator Erdoğan\" began trending worldwide almost immediately. When the official Turkish account of Twitter tweeted, \"Turkish users can send Tweets using SMS\" and gave detailed instructions, Turks were already ahead of the game.</p><p>Actually, there were no shortage of tweets sent from Turkey at all. <a href=\"http://twitturk.com/\" title=\"TwitTurk website\">TwitTurk</a>, a website that records statistics of Turkish Twitter users, reported that more than 500,000 tweets were sent in the first two hours of the ban. Ironically enough, star names of Erdoğan's Justice and Development party (AKP), such as deputy prime minister Bülent Arınç and mayor of Ankara Melih Gökçek, continued tweeting well into today.</p><p>What's more, the AKP also continued to create promoted tweets and trends – services Twitter provides for a hefty amount of money. The hashtag \"Gökçek Kuzey Yıldızı\" (Gökçek North Star), a campaign sponsored by AKP's Ankara branch to promote Gökçek's controversial project to build a giant mosque in the capital, became the number one trending topic in Turkey in the first couple of hours of the ban. Another pro-AKP account promoted the ruling party's recent television broadcast, depicting hundreds running towards a Turkish flagpole – in the fashion of zombies from World War Z – after hearing Erdoğan's voice reading the national anthem.</p><p>As they did during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/whats-happening-in-turkey-occupy-gezi\" title=\"Guardian: What's happening in Turkey?\">Occupy Gezi days</a>, Turkish citizens created memes mocking the Twitter ban. However, neither the jokes nor the fact that tech-savvy Turks bypassed the ban without batting an eyelid are enough to shield us from the grim reality behind recent censorship. Twitter has become pivotal in organising anti-government dissent in the past year: the Occupy Gezi movement, which marches against the recently passed internet censorship bill that allows the government to block any content within four hours without a court order, and the massive street protest and the funeral attended by hundreds of thousands after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/turkish-police-teargas-crowds-mourning-berkin-elvan\" title=\"Guardian: Turkish police fire teargas at crowds mourning boy injured in protests\">death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan</a>, were initiated via social media.</p><p>Twitter has also become the main channel for talking about corruption allegations implicating Erdoğan and his family. Anonymous accounts leak alleged phone recordings of Erdoğan. Waiting for new recordings to surface around 9pm each night has become the most popular pastime of millions of Turks, who then spread the news like wildfire. These accounts have been announcing that the mother of all recordings will come out on 25 March, a mere five days before the upcoming local elections. Erdoğan, aware of this, said yesterday in an election rally hours before the block took effect: \"We will eradicate Twitter. I do not care what the international community says.\"</p><p>It looks like the Turkish public does not care what Erdoğan says either. Recent history around the world and in Turkey shows that social media is a serious threat to autocrats. Ancient censorship mechanisms, archaic politics and Orwellian threats do not work in the face of technological dissent and the voice of the streets.</p><p>When your old uncle gets you something out-of-touch for your birthday, what do yo do? You say thank you and then return it. Well, thank you Erdoğan, but we do not want your gift of censorship. Here is the receipt.</p>","headline":"We tech-savvy Turks are more than a match for Erdogan's Twitter ban","trailText":"<strong>Binnaz Saktanber: </strong>Ancient censorship mechanisms are no longer a problem for the young Turks who co-ordinate anti-government dissent","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395420095789/Turkish-women-using-mobil-006.jpg","wordcount":"605","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T17:04:58Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/21/tech-savvy-turks-erdogan-twitter-ban-censorship","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/21/tech-savvy-turks-erdogan-twitter-ban-censorship","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"world/censorship","webTitle":"Censorship","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/censorship","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"media/blogging","webTitle":"Blogging","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blogging","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/blogging","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/binnaz-saktanber","webTitle":"Binnaz Saktanber","r2ContributorId":"53797","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395422400898/binnaz_saktanber.jpeg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Binnaz Saktanber is a Turkish blogger and political scientist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/binnaz-saktanber","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/binnaz-saktanber","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432683445","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395420085578/Turkish-women-using-mobil-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Amaryah Paul/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Turkish women using mobile phones at a protest against  police violence","height":"54","credit":"Amaryah Paul/Demotix/Corbis","caption":"National protests in Turkey's Taksim Square over police violence: 'Twitter has become pivotal in organising anti-government dissent.'

Last week, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/03/12/russian-news-editor-fired-after-interviewing-ukrainian-nationalist/\">Galina Timchenko was ousted as editor</a> of the Russian news site Lenta.ru, after publishing an interview with a right wing Ukrainian nationalist. She was replaced with an editor much more friendly toward Putin and his allies. The websites of opposition leaders Garry Kasparov and Alexei Navalny have also been targeted, along with <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-russia-internet-idUSBREA2C21L20140313\">other sites critical</a> of the Russian president. </p><p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the embattled Turkish prime minister, recently pushed new censorship legislation through parliament, making it easier for the government to block web content – and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\">now Twitter is restricted across the country</a>. </p><p>Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro has <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/venezuela-cracks-down-on-internet-as-economy-implodes/\">blocked websites</a> covering topics that might be a bit uncomfortable for his government, such as skyrocketing inflation and anti-government protests. </p><p>World leaders may be cracking down on dissenting voices online – if ever there were a global trend, it’s that the revolution will be tweeted, and then restricted – but research shows there are reasons to be very optimistic about the future of internet freedom.</p><p>According to Freedom House (<a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013%20Summary%20of%20Findings.pdf\">pdf</a>), 24 nations have added new laws or regulations that restrict online speech since May 2012. Three years after the Arab Spring began in earnest, and a quarter century after he invented the world wide web, the foundation of Tim Berners-Lee <a href=\"https://thewebindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Web-Index-Annual-Report-2013-FINAL.pdf\">has found</a> that “targeted blocking and filtering of politically sensitive Web content by governments is also on the rise across the globe”. </p><p>Indeed, governments are becoming more clever about how to restrict speech in cyberspace, using laws against cybercrime, blasphemy or terrorism. But in a remarkably short period of time, people around the world have embraced the idea of an internet free from censorship. <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/03/19/emerging-and-developing-nations-want-freedom-on-the-internet/\">A new report here from the Pew Research Center</a> shows that majorities in 22 of 24 emerging and developing nations from across the globe say it is important that people have access to the internet without government censorship. This includes solid majorities in Putin’s Russia (63%) and Erdogan’s Turkey (58%). And in Maduro’s Venezuela, a stunning 89% oppose internet censorship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-80167292-80f1-4830-871a-6babb2064fb7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395414075890/0c03cf6c-a399-414d-b1ec-cc4e795b5e44-196x420.png\" alt=\"Turkey Twitter graphic\" width=\"196\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A recent survey by the Pew Research Center shows that for most people, access to the internet without government censorship is important. Image: Courtesy of Pew Research Center</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The data also show why autocrats might have reason to fear open discussions in cyberspace. Internet usage, participation in social networking and support for internet freedom are generally more common among young people, the college educated and those with higher incomes – exactly the groups who are often at the forefront of protest movements and political change. For example, when  Hosni Mubarak fell from power in 2011, only <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/04/25/chapter-1-views-of-political-change/\">23% of Egyptians said</a> they were getting news and information about the political situation in their country via social networking – however, among college-educated Egyptians the number was 67%.</p><p>Overall, there is a strong relationship between internet adoption and support for internet freedom: the higher the percentage of people online in a given country, the greater the opposition to censorship.</p><p>Among the emerging and developing nations we surveyed in 2013, support for an uncensored internet is high in places like Chile and Argentina, where roughly two-thirds of the population goes online; meanwhile, it’s relatively low in countries such as Pakistan, Uganda and Indonesia, where internet penetration remains limited. </p><p>Our research shows that once people get access to the internet, they quickly begin incorporating it into their lives. In 19 of 22 nations we polled, half or more of internet users said they go online daily. The data on views about censorship suggest that people not only begin to include the internet in their daily lives, they also bring it into their political thinking, and make free expression on the internet a political priority, just like other civil liberties. </p><p>Speaking in 2010, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton updated Franklin Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms by <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/21/internet_freedom\">adding one for the 21st century</a>: the freedom to connect – “the idea that governments should not prevent people from connecting to the internet, to websites, or to each other. The freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly in cyberspace.” </p><p>It may be a while before the freedom to connect trumps <a href=\"http://www.fdrfourfreedomspark.org/pages/the-four-freedoms\">Roosevelt’s original four</a> – freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. But the internet has already become an important public gathering place, and as access spreads to more and more people around the globe, it will become a central feature of politics nearly everywhere – not just a meme but a reality. Even Putin and Erdogan may not be able to shut down sites quickly enough.</p>","headline":"Turkey's Twitter block and propaganda be damned: revolutions will be tweeted","trailText":"<b>Richard

Only Turkcell supports MMS, which means only users on this carrier will be able to send pictures with their tweets.</p><h2>Change the domain name settings (DNS)</h2><p></p><p>After Erdogan announced the Twitter ban, many Turkish news websites published instructions on how to change the domain name settings (DNS) on computers and mobile devices to conceal their geographic whereabouts. In short, using just two numerical codes,&nbsp;users are tricking their device into thinking they’re using it from somewhere other than Turkey. </p><p>Users can change their DNS by changing two codes which act as an identifier for the device they are using. Head of the webspam team at Google Matt Cutts tweeted the codes for Google’s Public DNS:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mattcutts/statuses/446939287733280768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Google Public DNS is fast with great uptime.

In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeelieKroesEU/status/446784267541291008\" title=\"\">The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly</a>. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.\"</p><p>Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: \"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards.\"</p><p>The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.</p><p>Shortly after the Twitter ban came into effect about midnight, the microblogging company tweeted instructions to users in Turkey on how to circumvent it using text messaging services in Turkish and English. Turkish tweeters were quick to share other methods of tiptoeing around the ban, using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow internet users to connect to the web undetected – or changing the domain name settings on computers and mobile devices to conceal their geographic whereabouts.</p><p>Some large Turkish news websites also published step-by-step instructions on how to change domain name system (DNS) settings.</p><p>On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets –  17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting  records for Twitter use in the country. \"Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan,\" posted @Fakir_Bey. \"And yours?\"</p><p>But it was not just critics of the government who took to Twitter after the site was closed. The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökcek, famous for his extensive and rather bullish use of the micro-blogging site, was the first politician from Erdogan's ruling AK party to breach the ban. \"I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it. That will probably be banned tomorrow as well. I hope that all those who are cursing and using fake accounts will have learnt their lesson,\" he tweeted, as usual all in capitals.</p><p>The first cabinet member to post a tweet after the ban came into effect was the deputy prime minister, Bülent Arinç, who informed his 1.34 million followers of an election rally in the city of Manisa. His message was retweeted more than 1,000 times in the first hour, causing much ridicule:</p><p>\"Oh dear, be careful, Twitter has been banned by the \"national will\",\" replied Ayse Cavdar, an academic and journalist. \"Don't show up here. Otherwise the \"national will\" will close you down, too.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, said he expected the ban to be temporary. \"I don't think this will last too long. A mutual solution needs to be found,\" Babacan told a local TV channel on Friday.</p><p>In a rare act of defiance, the Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, openly criticised the ban – via his Twitter account. \"The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,\" he tweeted. \"Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.\"</p><p>Later on Friday afternoon several Twitter users in Turkey reported that they were able to access the site again while Turkey's Telecommunications Authority (TIB) denied that the ban had been removed.</p><p>Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Işik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.</p><p>Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.</p><p>Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter \"a menace to society\".</p><p>Twitter has also been used to disseminate a series of  apparently incriminating audio recordings suggesting massive corruption inside the Turkish government.</p><p>Turkish officials stressed their discontent about Twitter's \"refusal to obey Turkish laws\" and to remove individual Twitter accounts that, according to court rulings, breached \"privacy rights\".</p><p>Many expect more explosive revelations to be made via Twitter in the week running up to local elections on 30 March. Two weeks ago Erdogan threatened to ban Facebook and Twitter, accusing social media users of abusing these platforms for a \"smear campaign\" against his government.</p><p>Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.</p><p>\"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism,\" said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.</p>","headline":"Turkey Twitter users flout Erdogan ban on micro-blogging site","trailText":"<p>Twitter use breaks new record in country as

It said that action had been taken against Twitter as a \"protection measure\".</p><p>But Turkish telecoms watchdog BTK said on Friday that the ban came after complaints were made by citizens that the social media platform was breaching privacy. </p><p>The watchdog had previously asked Twitter to remove some content but Twitter had failed to do so, the BTK said in a statement on its website. </p><p>\"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,\" it said. </p><p>The company made no formal statement but published a message on Thursday advising users in Turkey that it was possible to send tweets using mobile phone text messaging.</p><p>Erdoğan had made repeated threats to shut down social media sites after audio recordings of his alleged conversations suggesting corruption were leaked.</p><p>Two weeks ago he suggested that a total ban on sites like Facebook and YouTube were in his thoughts. The point was dismissed days later by the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, but Erdoğan then repeated his claims. \"We will wipe out all of these,\" Erdoğan told thousands of supporters at a rally in the north-west province of Bursa.</p><p>\"The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,\" he said.</p><p>Previously, he said that his government was determined to stem the leaks he insisted were being instigated by followers of an influential US-based Muslim cleric, Reuters reported.</p><p>The agency said Erdoğan accused supporters of Fethullah Gülen of infiltrating police and the judiciary and of engaging in \"espionage\" saying that the group even listened in on his encrypted telephone lines. The Gülen movement denies involvement.</p><p>\"We are determined on the issue, regardless of what the world may say,\" Erdoğan said. \"We won't allow the people to be devoured by YouTube, Facebook or others. Whatever steps need to be taken we will take them without wavering.\"</p><p>Asked if the steps could include shutting those sites down, Erdoğan reportedly replied: \"That included. Because these people or institutions are [using social media] for all kinds of immorality, all kinds of espionage and spying.\"</p><p>Following his speech, Erdoğan's office said in a statement that Erdoğan was referring to what it called Twitter's failure to implement Turkish court orders seeking the removal of some links and that they may be left with no option but to ban the platform.</p><p>\"If Twitter officials insist on not implementing court orders and rules of law ... there will be no other option but to prevent access to Twitter to help satisfy our citizens' grievances,\" the statement said.</p><p>Turkish internet users were quick to come up with their own ways to circumvent the block. The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly moved among the top trending globally.</p><p>The disruption sparked a virtual uproar with many comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls to take to the street to protest, although some users equally called for calm.</p><p>Nazli Ilicak, a columnist who used to work for the pro-government Sabah newspaper described the move as \"a civil coup\" in an interview on broadcaster CNN Turk.</p>","headline":"Turkey blocks use of Twitter after prime minister attacks social media site","trailText":"<p>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatens to 'root out' social media network where wiretapped recordings have been leaked</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395361207293/-Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-tal-003.jpg","wordcount":"608","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T00:23:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/youtube","references":[]},{"id":"technology/facebook","webTitle":"Facebook","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/facebook","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"media/blogging","webTitle":"Blogging","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blogging","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/blogging","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevin-rawlinson","webTitle":"Kevin Rawlinson","r2ContributorId":"58554","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Rawlinson is a freelance reporter who writes for the Guardian and other publications.

Last summer, Recep Tayyip Erdogan went so far as to brand social media \"the worst menace to society\" in this secular Islamic republic of 74&nbsp;million, where between 50% and 60% are under the age of 30. He laments a \"robot lobby\" – nefarious forces, which aim to take down his government with tweets on social media (his own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_Erdogan\" title=\"\">Twitter profile</a>, I suspect, is run by a communications team, and has 4.16 million followers).</p><p>Even his wife has chimed in to express her concerns over \"technology addiction\". Where Michelle Obama fights obesity, or Samantha Cameron glides around fashion councils, Emine&nbsp;Erdogan has said that social media is worse&nbsp;than alcohol, drugs and gambling.</p><p>Last week marked the funeral of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old boy died nine months after being hit by a police canister during the Gezi Park protests, reigniting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent\" title=\"\">a new wave of protests</a>. Erdogan did not utter a word of condolence. Ironically he emphasised his tech credentials instead, claiming that his role was to \"give children tablet computers\", not supply them with&nbsp;\"molotov cocktails, stones or slings\".</p><p>But<strong> </strong>who are these mighty robots launching \"hashtag wars\" on Twitter? Images from Battlestar Galactica spring to mind. Is my sister a soldier in the robot lobby? Will her eyes turn to lasers and fry our next family lunch?</p><p>Maybe the Erdogans have a point – are we just narcissistic millennials? Last week two guys in Istanbul even took and tweeted a selfie at a major police crackdown. The picture of protesters grinning defiantly as they were packed into the back of a police van became known as the \"<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/14/turkish-protest-ellen-selfie/\" title=\"\">Ellen selfie</a>\" and went viral.</p><p>Engin Önder is one of these \"technology addicts\" rattling the prime minister's offline cage. A co-founder of Turkey's popular citizen journalism network, <a href=\"http://140journos.com/\" title=\"\">140journos</a>, he and his friends have been documenting news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/140journos\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> since early 2012. They have tweeted ferociously from left, conservative and LGBTQ protests, as well as courtrooms where accredited journalists were not allowed in. Önder does not strike me as a member of some kind of robot lobby – but I remain sceptical.</p><p>\"I'd only attended one rally before 140journos,\" he says – a Don't Touch My Internet protest in June 2011. So if these twentysomethings are not really conspiring against the government, what exactly are they trying to achieve? His fellow co-founder Cem Aydogdu wanted to cover citizen news because his father had kicked him out of the house for reading alternative newspapers. \"Cem wanted to hack his parents and sway his father,\" says Önder.</p><p>As the Gezi protests kicked off, the 140journos network grew by six times almost overnight. The grievances of young people all around Turkey streamed through their timeline. Verifying and curating thousands of tweets 24/7, they did not leave his small apartment in Istanbul for days.</p><p>For Turkey's Generation Y, who grew up with the internet, defending the freedom to share information online becomes at least equally, if not more, important than individual politics. <a href=\"http://www.denizergurel.net/internet-in-turkey-2013/\" title=\"\">Just under 50% are online</a> every day. They are often willing to put themselves at personal risk to capture images from the frontline of protests.</p><p>Many are trying to hack a way out of the political crisis closing in on them. The deepening polarisation is intensified by Erdogan's bellicose rhetoric. Generation Y tweets through teargas to expose how absurd the reductive narratives of the political elite are. They poke fun at the dismissive language of government officials. They mock the mainstream media that is complicit in misrepresenting them.</p><p>The country's young protesters do not document their struggle on social media because they are narcissistic millennials. Yes, they want to be visible, but not for likes or pokes or friends; they document their resistance to cultivate social empathy for everyone. They are not a self-affirming group who bury their heads in the sand when violence hits other homes. They are aware that preaching to the young and already-converted, and ignoring the rest of Turkish society out in the analog cold generates a dangerous sense of \"us v them\". They do not want to be portrayed in these divisive terms, which cement their differences. There is no need.</p><p>Cem's father, for example, who used to read just one newspaper, has since become an activist who now encourages young people at protests to send reports to 140journos.</p><p>\"We are just like everyone else,\" says Ali Emre Mazlumoglu, one of the 13 protesters from the \"Ellen selfie in the police van\". \"But what makes us peculiar in the midst of all the pressure and violence is that we can still laugh our way through it all.\" Governed by a prime minister who can't stand political satire in cartoons, or thinks <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/woman-detained-over-gesture-at-turkish-pm-erdogan-claims-misunderstanding.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=63714&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">passersby who give him the middle finger should be detained</a>, young people in Turkey are holding on tight to their mobile phones – and to their sense of humour.</p><p>• This article was amended on 19 March.

Uncovering abandoned sex museums and decrepit amusement parks</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett\">Urban exploration</a> has been gaining adepts for a while now, and it seems to be the go-to-hobby for the adventurous souls who need tangible and risky thrills in city environments. Now, the Japanese have given it a name, haikyo, and are taking it to structures such as abandoned amusement parks and old sex museums. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/12/travel/japan-urban-exploration/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5\">This CNN reportage</a> follows the steps of German Florian Seidel, who has been seeking out and visiting crumbling Japanese infrastructures for five years. He visited two abandoned sex museums which have been deserted for a decade – after the advent of the Internet, he says – but still maintain quite a lot of their charm, so to speak. “The one in Hokkaido he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys”, writes Kate Whitehead.

Cities we lost</a></h2><p>This Al-Jazeera article follows the history of cities that were once pan-Mediterranean hubs such as Alexandria and which, in the last century, have been losing a lot of their character though demolition. In the context of political and economic crises in Turkey and Greece or the strife in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere, “why cry over the eradication of an era that is anyway irretrievably extinct?” <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/cities-lost-20143125644720862.html\">asks Iason Athanasiadis</a>. “I believe we should care because the story of how the cosmopolitan era ended allows us to uncover the threads of the narrative that brought us to the current precipice: a largely homogenised region facilitated by the expulsion of minorities and fostering of so-called ‘pure’ Turkish, Greek or Arab nations”, he writes<a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/cities-lost-20143125644720862.html\"></a>.

Shipping containers reinvented as new homes for Shanghai’s migrant workers </a></h2><p>Many migrant workers in Shanghai have long been living in deplorable conditions – some of them even in homes built out of containers, and for years. While some of these communities <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/90882/8178623.html\">have faced relocation</a>, a new container village endorsed by the government and created by a non-profit company is ready to open. Dubbed Community Cube, this two-storey 150 square-metred structure was completed last year and is formed by a number of used shipping containers joined together by metal plates, as reported in Gizmag. These plates can actually be detached, explains <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113037543665572785764/posts\">Adam Williams</a>, “allowing the separate containers to be transported more easily if the migrants need to move on”.<br></p><h2><a href=\"http://cairobserver.com/post/78217823320/7-documentaries-about-life-in-cairo-you-need-to-watch#.UyMflfY2Te7\">4.

The changing face of Asian cities</a><br></h2><p>It’s hard to keep up with the changes going on in many Asian cities. Some of them have skylines that change drastically every year. Dutch photographer Marcel Heijnen, here <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26565009\">interviewed by the BBC</a>, took to Singapore – where “you blink and there’s a new building”–, Hong Kong and other cities to capture these quickly evolving cityscapes. He explains that he has two habits: one is look out for walls with interesting damage or decay, which “almost look like nature’s coincidental abstract paintings”, and another habit of his is to look for reflections in windows or rain puddles.

After Thursday's funeral, violent clashes broke out in several cities, with riot police deploying water cannon and teargas against mourners in Istanbul.</p><p>In the eastern province of Tunceli a police officer suffered a heart attack during protests. In Istanbul the death of Burakcan Karamanoglu, 22, followed clashes between police and protesters on Wednesday night. He was allegedly killed by a bullet to the head in his neighbourhood of Okmeydani, a few metres from the house of Elvan's family.</p><p>His death was announced on live TV by Aziz Babuscu, the ruling AK party's Istanbul provincial head. \"There were two groups attacking the police and one youth suffered a head injury … and lost his life,\" he told CNN Turk. He said at the time of Karamanoglu's death no police were present.</p><p>The dead man's father, Halil Karamanoglu, said a bullet was fired from the direction of protesters involved in the clashes following the funeral of the teenage boy. \"People were walking up from these protests. [My son and his friends] were standing outside, watching them. They came towards him and his friends. Everything happened in only five, 10 minutes. A bullet hit him out of nowhere. From the direction of the protesters.\"</p><p>He urged everyone to unite, and underlined that too many parents had suffered already.</p><p>Other witness reports cited in Turkish media have alleged that an angry verbal exchange between \"two opposing groups\" preceded the shooting and that pro-government football fans were involved in the fight on Karamanoglu's side. The police have not confirmed any of these reports. The Guardian was unable to independently verify any of these statements.</p><p>At the funeral – the second burial in two days – hundreds of mourners, many of whom came from the neighbourhood of Karamanoglu's family, carried red carnations and Turkish flags. Angry protesters brandished photos of the killed youth.</p><p>Prior to a series of elections starting this month the rift between the government and the local opposition has widened. Mourners responded with hostility to the foreign press.</p><p>\"We don't want to tell you what happened last night,\" one woman said. \"You, the foreign press, you have done enough damage, we are sick of you.\"</p><p>Other protesters shouted slogans targeting the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP): \"Killer CHP,\" some chanted, and others: \"Killer Kilicdaroglu,\" referring to the party's leader.</p>","headline":"Turkey protests: two more deaths feed growing discontent","trailText":"<p>Police officer has heart attack and young man allegedly shot in head during clashes following funeral of teenage boy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394738595930/Protesters-attack-a-Turki-006.jpg","wordcount":"487","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T19:24:37Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"publication/guardianweekly","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly","type":"publication","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/guardianweekly","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432290911","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394738589640/Protesters-attack-a-Turki-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Demotix/Corbis","photographer":"Ahmed Hadrovic","altText":"Protesters attack a Turkish police van following the funeral of a teenager","height":"54","credit":"Ahmed Hadrovic/Demotix/Corbis","caption":"Protesters in Istanbul attack a Turkish police van following the funeral of a teenager who died nine months after being hit by a police teargas canister.

Hatice's son, Onur, was a talented young architect – a graduate of one of the leading universities. In&nbsp;2010 Onur was taken into custody on suspicion of selling drugs. He was allegedly tortured, verbally and sexually abused and, on his release, put under pressure by police to become an informer. After weeks of anguish the architect jumped from the balcony of his home, ending his life. This month his 57-year-old mother followed suit. The family's efforts to bring the police officers responsible for&nbsp;Orun's death to justice had all come&nbsp;to&nbsp;nought.</p><p>This week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/mar/13/berkin-elvan-funeral-protests-in-turkey-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Turkey also buried Berkin Elvan</a>. The 14-year-old was on his way out to buy bread last year when he was hit in the head by a gas canister fired during a police crackdown on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/tornistan-turkey-animated-film-gezi-park\" title=\"\">anti-government protesters in Gezi park</a>. After months in a coma, he became the eighth victim of the brutality used by police to put down last year's unrest.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out for Berkin's funeral but the police used teargas and water cannon on the mourners. So his death has brought a wave of new protests and clashes across the country. Two people died in the trouble on Wednesday night. As&nbsp;the film director Umit Unal tweeted of the vicious spiral of violence and grief: \"Living in this country has turned into an agonising futility.\"</p><p>While Turkey's mainstream papers and TV channels are reluctant to give full coverage to these tragedies, the internet is awash with public anger. Via YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, Turkey's young, urban population are increasingly voicing their discontent and frustration. An irreversible transformation is taking place as corruption scandals involving government officials, businessmen, and even prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family are&nbsp;brought to light.</p><p>Every day a new tape recording is leaked, usually in the evening when internet use is at its peak. Millions of people, instead of going out to movies or to eat with friends, turn on their computers and go online to learn about the latest scandal. Both Erdogan's supporters and opponents agree that the&nbsp;AK&nbsp;party is facing its biggest challenge in&nbsp;11 years of power.</p><p>Among the leaks was a tape that allegedly involved the prime minister talking to his son about meddling in elections for the chairmanship of Fenerbahce, one of the top football clubs. In another tape, Erdogan is heard discussing the continuing trial of media giant Dogan with the justice minister. Erdogan has not only confirmed but defended the conversation, saying it was natural for him to follow the matter, even though it is being seen as interfering with the judicial process.</p><p>If the tapes are shocking, the way in which they have been obtained is also problematic. It is now claimed that officers close to the Gulen movement, inspired by US-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-turkey-gulen-idUSBREA291SL20140310\" title=\"\">Erdogan's chief adversary</a>, have secretly and illegally tapped thousands of phones, and recorded thousands of conversations over the years. Pro-government newspapers are&nbsp;publishing details of the tapping, which in itself is another scandal.</p><p>Erdogan and Gulen, allies in past battles against the Turkish military, are now embroiled in an epic feud. It first surfaced in 2010 after Gulen attacked Erdogan's handling of the Gaza aid flotilla crisis, but Erdogan now blames Gulen for whipping up an anti-government plot. Already divided between conservatives and secularists, Turkey is facing yet another polarisation. But Turks themselves are increasingly tiring of this battle of wills. People&nbsp;from different ideological and cultural backgrounds are now united in&nbsp;profound distrust of their rulers.</p><p>From childhood, Turks learn to hold&nbsp;the state in high esteem, so much so that some people even name their children \"Devlet\"– state. Respect for the state today is the lowest it has ever&nbsp;been. As the power struggle rages,&nbsp;the people of Turkey feel betrayed&nbsp;and forsaken. When elephants&nbsp;fight it is the grass that suffers. Whichever side wins, Turkey's democracy is already a casualty.</p>","headline":"Whoever wins Turkey's power struggle, democracy is already a casualty","trailText":"<strong>Elif Shafak:</strong> With mainstream media reluctant to cover it, the unfolding turmoil is being played out on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394725980372/People-protesting-about-t-008.jpg","wordcount":"645","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T16:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/turkey-democracy-power-struggle-democracy-youtube-facebook-twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/turkey-democracy-power-struggle-democracy-youtube-facebook-twitter","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elif-shafak","webTitle":"Elif Shafak","r2ContributorId":"43358","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/21/1300711935444/Elif.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elif Shafak is an award-winning novelist.

In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeelieKroesEU/status/446784267541291008\" title=\"\">The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly</a>. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.\"</p><p>Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: \"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards.\"</p><p>The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.</p><p>Shortly after the Twitter ban came into effect about midnight, the microblogging company tweeted instructions to users in Turkey on how to circumvent it using text messaging services in Turkish and English. Turkish tweeters were quick to share other methods of tiptoeing around the ban, using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow internet users to connect to the web undetected – or changing the domain name settings on computers and mobile devices to conceal their geographic whereabouts.</p><p>Some large Turkish news websites also published step-by-step instructions on how to change domain name system (DNS) settings.</p><p>On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets –  17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting  records for Twitter use in the country. \"Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan,\" posted @Fakir_Bey. \"And yours?\"</p><p>But it was not just critics of the government who took to Twitter after the site was closed. The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökcek, famous for his extensive and rather bullish use of the micro-blogging site, was the first politician from Erdogan's ruling AK party to breach the ban. \"I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it. That will probably be banned tomorrow as well. I hope that all those who are cursing and using fake accounts will have learnt their lesson,\" he tweeted, as usual all in capitals.</p><p>The first cabinet member to post a tweet after the ban came into effect was the deputy prime minister, Bülent Arinç, who informed his 1.34 million followers of an election rally in the city of Manisa. His message was retweeted more than 1,000 times in the first hour, causing much ridicule:</p><p>\"Oh dear, be careful, Twitter has been banned by the \"national will\",\" replied Ayse Cavdar, an academic and journalist. \"Don't show up here. Otherwise the \"national will\" will close you down, too.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, said he expected the ban to be temporary. \"I don't think this will last too long. A mutual solution needs to be found,\" Babacan told a local TV channel on Friday.</p><p>In a rare act of defiance, the Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, openly criticised the ban – via his Twitter account. \"The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,\" he tweeted. \"Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.\"</p><p>Later on Friday afternoon several Twitter users in Turkey reported that they were able to access the site again while Turkey's Telecommunications Authority (TIB) denied that the ban had been removed.</p><p>Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Işik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.</p><p>Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.</p><p>Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter \"a menace to society\".</p><p>Twitter has also been used to disseminate a series of  apparently incriminating audio recordings suggesting massive corruption inside the Turkish government.</p><p>Turkish officials stressed their discontent about Twitter's \"refusal to obey Turkish laws\" and to remove individual Twitter accounts that, according to court rulings, breached \"privacy rights\".</p><p>Many expect more explosive revelations to be made via Twitter in the week running up to local elections on 30 March. Two weeks ago Erdogan threatened to ban Facebook and Twitter, accusing social media users of abusing these platforms for a \"smear campaign\" against his government.</p><p>Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.</p><p>\"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism,\" said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.</p>","headline":"Turkey Twitter users flout Erdogan ban on micro-blogging site","trailText":"<p>Twitter use breaks new record in country as

He was hit in the head by a teargas cartridge fired by the police and had been in a coma ever since.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, police fired teargas to disperse protesters gathered outside the Istanbul hospital where Berkin died, after some people started throwing objects at an armoured police vehicle.</p><p>In Ankara, riot police used water cannon and teargas against a crowd of about 2,000 who blocked a highway to mourn the teenager's death and to contest continued police impunity. In several cities, there were sit-ins and silent protests.</p><p>According to doctors, Berkin's health had deteriorated gravely and his weight had dropped to 16kg (two and a half stone) in recent weeks.</p><p>Announcing his death on Twitter, Berkin's parents wrote: \"To our people: We lost our son Berkin Elvan at 7am this morning. Condolences to us all.\" Gülsüm Elvan, the boy's mother, expressed her anger towards the Turkish government: \"Not God took my son away, but [Prime Minister Recep] Tayyip Erdoğan,\" she said, according to the Turkish press.</p><p>President Abdullah Gül, who was the first senior politician to inquire after the teenager's health on Monday, publicly extended his condolences towards the family this morning.</p><p>\"He was only 14 when the incident happened. I share the family's sorrow,\" Gül said.</p><p>Istanbul governor Hüseyin Avni Mutlu's expression of regret at the \"loss\" on Twitter was met with outrage on social media. \"We did not 'lose' Berkin; you killed him,\" several people tweeted.</p><p>Throughout last June, hundreds of thousands took to the streets when an environmental protest aimed at saving an inner city park snowballed into a nationwide display of anger at Erdoğan's increasingly authoritarian stance.</p><p>The teenager's death raises the number of deaths from last summer's protests to seven, at least four directly resulting from police violence. Turkish police have been accused of using excessive force against the protesters in Istanbul's Gezi Park and in demonstrations that spread all over the country.</p><p>According to the Turkish Medical Association, about 8,000 people were injured as a result of the police's heavy-handed interventions: 104 sustained serious head injuries and 11 lost an eye, mostly after being hit by plastic bullets fired by the police.</p><p>Rights groups have repeatedly condemned the use of excessive police violence during the protests. A Human Rights Watch dispatch published on Tuesday stressed that the firing of teargas directly at protesters violated international legal standards.</p><p>\"The case of Berkin Elvan has become a symbol for Turkey's record of police violence and impunity,\" said Emma Sinclair-Webb, a senior Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch.</p><p>\"The enormous outpouring of anger at these horrors is also due to the silence of the government on Berkin Elvan's death and on this issue in general.\"</p>","headline":"Turkish police fire teargas to quell protests after boy, 15, dies","trailText":"Berkin Elvan has been in coma since June last year when he was hit by a teargas cartridge during anti-government protests in Istanbul","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394558958267/Berkin-Elvan-coffin-006.jpg","wordcount":"497","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-14T17:34:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/turkish-police-teargas-protests-boy-15-dies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/11/turkish-police-teargas-protests-boy-15-dies","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431829864","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394558949539/Berkin-Elvan-coffin-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Emrah Gurel","altText":"Berkin Elvan coffin","height":"54","credit":"Emrah Gurel/AP","caption":"The coffin of Berkin Elvan is carried through Istanbul.

If we bow to this, we will be doing injustice to all coming prime ministers and ministers.\"</p><p>In the recording, a man alleged to be Erdogan tells his son to dispose of tens of millions as investigators are searching the homes of relatives of three cabinet ministers \"for a big corruption operation\".</p><p>\"OK, so what I am saying is, get all that stuff in your house out. OK?\" he says.</p><p>A voice alleged to be that of his son, Billal replies: \"Dad, could that be? There is your money in the safe.\" The older man's voice responds: \"That's what I mean.\"</p><p>Later, the person alleged to be the prime minister asks: \"Did you make most of it vanish?\" He is answered: \"We haven't been able to do all of it yet. There are about 30m euros left. We haven't been able to get that out yet.\"</p><p>Erdogan described the recordings as \"blackmail, being spread via Twitter\".</p><p>But he admitted his phone had been tapped in what he called \"Turkey's biggest eavesdropping scandal of all times\".</p><p>Pro-government newspapers have claimed that thousands of government officials, academics, business people and journalists have been listened to illegally. It has been impossible to verify the authenticity of the recordings, which first appeared on YouTube but quickly spread across social media sites. Even so, they are likely to inflict a painful political blow.</p><p>The alleged conversation is said to have taken place on 17 December last year – a day on which police conducted a series of surprise raids that resulted in the arrest of the sons of three government ministers and several high-profile businessmen.</p><p>Since December, Erdogan has removed or fired the key people involved in these investigations, reappointed thousands of police officials and prosecutors, and rushed through laws tightening government control over the judiciary and prosecution services.</p><p>He has repeatedly blamed the US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen – a former ally – for orchestrating what he says is a campaign aimed at toppling the government.</p><p>Erogan has held emergency meetings with the head of the Turkish secret intelligence agency, Hakan Fidan, since the recordings emerged, Turkish media has reported. The prime minister's office has issued a statement threatening legal action against anyone who circulated them.</p><p>The main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) has demanded that Erdogan resign. Speaking at a party meeting on Tuesday, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said there was little doubt about the authenticity of the recordings and that the government had lost its legitimacy.</p><p>\"Take your helicopter and flee, go abroad, or resign from the prime ministry. Someone who robs the country cannot sit in the seat of a prime minister,\" he said.</p><p>Devlet Bahceli, head of the right-wing National Movement party (MHP), used equally damning words in local election rally speech on Tuesday: \"This is a very critical moment for Turkey. Hunger, injustice, immorality, corruption and bribery are amongst Turkey's main problems. This is the image we have of eleven years of [the AKP's rule].</p><p>said: \"There are signs that the prime minister is at the head of corruption in Turkey. The prime minister speaks of a plot. If it really is a lie and a plot, it should be proven to the people. But if any of this is true, he cannot remain prime minister for even one second longer. The prosecution has to act.\"</p><p>Others in the opposition, however, cautioned against action that would plunge Turkey further into chaos. The co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party, Selahattin Demirtas, said that all responsible parties should be brought to justice.</p><p>\"The only things the prime minister should do is to let justice take its course. You might not save yourself, but you might save this country, with more transparency and more democracy.\"</p>","headline":"Leaked tapes prompt calls for Turkish PM to resign","trailText":"Recordings appear to capture Recep Tayyip Erdogan instructing son to dispose of hidden funds amid corruption investigation","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393356871405/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-006.jpg","wordcount":"778","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-28T19:35:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm","tags":[{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430737178","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393356863938/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Burhan Ozbilici","altText":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","height":"54","credit":"Burhan Ozbilici/AP","caption":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses MPs in Ankara.

The good jobs, the better pay, the promotion prospects all depended on your dedication to a shadowy Islamic network with its headquarters based in Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"They kept tabs on every recruit, had a grading system from zero to five – five being the ones who prayed, fasted, never drank alcohol,\" the policeman said, referring to the movement founded by the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, who lives in exile in the US.</p><p>\"Everything starts in the police schools,\" said Yilmaz. \"They came to me once, I said no. But it's very subtle. One day a friend will ask you to go to breakfast at a certain friend's house, to read a certain book, go for dinner. These appointments become more and more regular. When you're in school, you have very little money. They organise a few things to make it easier. Free meals, for example, free accommodation. Once you're inside, they organise your life; you just get sucked in. And once you graduate, you can start working in whichever unit you like.\"</p><p>The power and the influence of the elderly cleric is the defining issue of Turkish politics. Recep Tayyıp Erdoğan, the prime minister, has declared war on Gülen – previously a key ally of his conservative, Islamic ruling party – following the eruption of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/turkish-ministers-sons-arrested-corruption-investigation\" title=\"\">corruption scandal in December</a> that implicates the government, the prime minister's closest associates and his family.</p><p>Erdoğan responded ferociously, purging the police of thousands of officers, transferring prosecutors linked to the investigation and tightening control over the judiciary. A fortnight ago, according to senior officials in Brussels, he told EU leaders that his fight with Gülen was a matter of political survival. \"He was gripped with this obsession of killing the parallel state, as he called it,\" said a well-placed EU official.</p><p>In Turkey it has long been assumed that Gülen's network exercised unaccountable influence inside the judicial and security apparatus. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jan/09/press-freedom-turkey\" title=\"\">investigative journalist Ahmet Şık</a> was jailed for writing a book about it, as was Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief. But that was when Erdoğan and Gülen were allies.</p><h2><strong>Assertion</strong></h2><p>In 2009 the then US ambassador in Ankara, James Jeffrey, wrote in a cable to the state department: \"The assertion that the Turkish national police is controlled by Gülenists is impossible to confirm but we have found no one who disputes it.\"</p><p>Yilmaz and other police officers who spoke up confirmed the scale and degree of penetration by adherents of a movement that is religious, cultural and educational as well as political.</p><p>Oğuz Gün* has been working in the Istanbul police force for more than seven years. \"Such opaque groups are very dangerous. And [Gülen's] is a group that discriminates against those who don't share the same values and the same lifestyle. I have seen how they started to mistake sins for crimes, both inside and outside the force,\" he said.</p><p>He sought transfers to other units: secret intelligence, anti-terror, organised crime. To no avail. Gün was never affiliated with the Gülenist movement. \"Sometimes they openly asked for a reference. Without it, I didn't stand a chance.\"</p><p>Yilmaz said: \"If you asked someone how did you manage to get into the secret intelligence unit, they would answer: I prayed and got in. We had friends who spoke six languages, were top of their class, and were standing guard outside police stations. And others who were a lot less qualified got the top jobs only because they were connected with the Gülenists.\"</p><p>The assumption in Turkey and abroad is that the corruption allegations against the Erdoğan administration originate with Gülen, and that they are likely to be well-founded because of the quality of the intelligence the movement commands. Erdoğan is seen to be trying not only to destroy the cleric but also to bury the corruption allegations.</p><p>Şık, the journalist jailed in 2011 for writing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/turkey-censorship-ahmet-sik-perrier\" title=\"\">book on Gülen's penetration of the police</a>, highlighted what many see as the problem. \"The attempt to purge Gülenists doesn't mean that [Erdoğan] is right. There is also a real witchhunt going on. We have massive corruption on the one hand, but the investigation against it also violates democratic and judicial principles. It's a choice between a rock and a hard place, pest and cholera. One is not better, or cleaner, than the other.\"</p><p>The officers welcomed the backlash against the network inside the police but stressed that it should not serve to legitimise corruption. \"Of course I want those who are corrupt to be punished. I am not defending corruption at all. But these purges were long overdue,\" said Yilmaz. \"The government knew about this. It was the government in the first place who enabled them, who helped them, they came to power together. Helping them was the government's biggest mistake.\"</p><p>Gün spoke of a huge sense of relief among his colleagues that the police were being cleared of the network. \"It really was an atmosphere of deep paranoia. Even if it seemed technically impossible for every single officer's phone to be tapped, we were all afraid of being spied on all the time.\"</p><p>The pressure was subtle, but constant: \"Nobody would force you to pray, or fast during Ramadan. But they kept tabs on all of that, on everyone. Nobody talked about it. Everybody knew, but nobody dared to discuss the issue. This has started to change.\"</p><p>Erdoğan's offensive represents a sea change. The domination of his Justice and Development party (AKP) for more than a decade was aided by his alliance with Gülen, the cleric's formidable organisation, money and influence.</p><p>Those who dared to criticise the Gülen movement before were swiftly punished. Şık was accused of being a member of a nationalist network, although he and his colleagues had previously disclosed plans by the same network to stage a military coup against the AKP government. He was released from jail in 2012, but his trial is ongoing.</p><h2><strong>Phone-tapping</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief and former Gülen supporter, was arrested on charges of being a member of a terrorist organisation after publishing a book in which he described the infiltration of the Turkish police force by the Gülenists and accused them of illegally tapping phones and falsifying evidence. Last year the self-described rightwing sympathiser was sentenced to more than 15 years in jail for membership of the armed leftwing group Revolutionary Headquarters.</p><p>Erdoğan's current purges are dramatic and far-reaching. But the officers say such purges have been taking place more quietly for years. According to both Yilmaz and Gün, internal investigations have been conducted against tens of thousands of police officers over the past four years alone. \"If someone was suspected of going against [Gülen] they were often hit with made-up disciplinary charges, transferred to bad posts, or even suspended,\" Gün said. \"The removals we see today are not new. They just hit the other camp.\"</p><p>Not all police officers, however, are as happy with the current purges. The Police Reform Group, an organisation campaigning for police rights, tweeted: \"How do you know that the officers who were transferred are Gülenists and members of an organisation? Do you have a detector? Where is justice?\"</p><p>EU officials monitoring the drama say Erdoğan is deploying an indiscriminate dragnet in the belief that it will catch all the Gülen appointments. Yilmaz agrees. \"I am guessing that not all of these guys were Gülenists. And not all sympathisers were bad, either. And no police officer should ever be punished just for doing a good job.\"</p><p>Faruk Sezer, a founding member of the unofficial police union Emniyet-Sen, argued that a transparent inquiry into the alleged shadow organisation was indispensable. \"If an officer committed a crime, it needs to be brought to light and that person needs to be suspended and punished. But those who were transferred without reason and proof should of course be reinstated.\"</p><p>Last month Istanbul prosecutors started an investigation into officers who took part in anti-corruption raids in December. Do police officers fear doing their job in such a loaded atmosphere? Yilmaz shrugged: \"We have started to tell jokes among ourselves like: oh dear, you caught a shoplifter, you'd better start packing your bags, you'll get transferred for that.\"</p><p>\"The war between Gülen and the government will not end any time soon,\" said Şık. \"Turkish people caught in the middle will suffer.

It’s repression. But the young will not be repressed. We won’t take it lying down.” </p><p>Protesters threw stones at police, smashed windows — including at a US fast-food outlet — and sprayed anarchy signs on banks. They were pursued by police down side streets off the central Istiklal boulevard. </p><p>Earlier in the day the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vehemently rejected criticism of the new curbs, passed on Wednesday by parliament, to a crowd of several thousand supporters in Istanbul.</p><p>“These regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the internet ... On the contrary they make it safer and freer.” </p><p>He denied that authorities would have access to internet users’ personal information: “Never. It is out of the question that people’s private data will be recorded.” </p><p>Critics have said the new curbs are an attempt by Erdogan to stifle dissent and stop evidence being seen online of high-level corruption. </p><p>They give the telecoms authority the power to order a webpage blocked without a court order if the content is deemed to infringe privacy or is offensive. </p><p>The timing has raised eyebrows because it comes as Erdogan deals with a graft scandal that erupted in December and implicates his inner circle. Erdogan has portrayed the investigation as a plot against him by people within the Turkish police and judiciary loyal to Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher living in the United States. </p><p>Human Rights Watch said the restrictions raised concerns that a “defensive government is seeking to increase its power to silence critics and to arbitrarily limit politically damaging material online”. </p><p>The European parliament’s president, Martin Schulz, has called the laws a “step back in an already suffocating environment for media freedom”. Washington has also expressed misgivings. </p><p>Erdogan’s government has sacked or moved to different jobs thousands of police and prosecutors ahead of important local elections on 30 March that could determine whether he runs for president in August. </p><p>Burak, a young demonstrator in Istanbul, said: “One of the few remaining liberties we have is the internet and being able to communicate. This is what they want to constrain … they are really scared of social networks and the internet.” </p><p>Erdogan, 59, who has been in power since 2003, is also seeking to push through legislation reforming the judiciary, which critics will say will increase government control. There also are worries for the freedom of the press. </p><p>On Friday an Azeri journalist and blogger was deported from Turkey because of tweets criticising the government, according to his newspaper, Zaman, which is close to Gulen. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said Mahir Zeynalov’s ejection “is a further setback for the dire state of media freedom in Turkey’’. </p><p>The US-based rights group Freedom House said that over the past year in Turkey “dozens of journalists have been fired because of government pressure, and government officials’ threats against journalists have become common”.</p>","headline":"Turkish police crack down on internet freedom protest","trailText":"Teargas and water cannon used as Erdogan government’s internet restrictions spark violent street scenes and global outcry<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866876/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"573","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-12T15:00:15+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-crack-down-on-internet-freedom-protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-crack-down-on-internet-freedom-protest","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"world/censorship","webTitle":"Censorship","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/censorship","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-701c702b-cd71-43f9-9784-90d62805dece","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866421/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866421/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-220x132.jpeg","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"OZAN KOSE","altText":"Istanbul riot","height":"132","credit":"OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"A protester clashes with riot police during the protest on Saturday.

In London the FTSE 100 closed slightly lower at 6544 following a 28-point fall, while the dollar weakened against two traditional safe-haven currencies – the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.</p><p>The Russian rouble hit a record low on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that the slow-growing commodity-dependent economy was likely to be one of the next countries to feel the impact of the emerging market sell-off.</p><p>\"The fact that currencies have continued to weaken even in countries that have started to raise interest rates opens up a new, and potentially more worrying, phase of the recent turmoil in EM financial markets in which beleaguered policymakers find themselves unable to defend their currencies,\" said Capital Economics.</p><p>The London-based consultancy said, however, that not all emerging markets were likely to be caught up in the deepening crisis and expressed confidence that countries such as Mexico, Poland and the Philippines were likely to shrug off the effects of weakening currencies.</p><p>Turkey was again the centre of attention on Wednesday after Erdogan made it clear he vehemently opposed the decision to raise interest rates and that the central bank would be responsible for any damage caused to the economy.</p><p>The lira gained almost 4% after the central bank finally decided on Tuesday to ignore Erdogan's opposition and adopt a more aggressive policy stance, but the gains rapidly melted away as investors reacted with alarm to the political schism.</p><p>Michael Hewson of CMC said: \"The bumper rate hike by the central bank of Turkey had a shelf life of less than 18 hours after Turkish prime minister Erdogan criticised the decision by saying that he would blame central bank officials for any damage caused to the economy by a slowdown in growth. As a result. the lira reversed all of last night's gain, after last night's initial spike higher.</p><p>\"The South African rand has also weakened sharply despite a 0.5% rate hike by the South African Reserve Bank. The net effect was the equivalent of standing in front of a runaway truck as after a brief spike, the move lower continued apace.\"</p>","headline":"Emerging markets crisis sees rush for safe
