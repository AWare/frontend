The literal meaning of \"paedophile\" should be someone who loves children, but few would say it is love that drives such a person. A paedophile does not love children; he abuses them. Still, paedophile is the word we are stuck with, this week especially. Exhumed from the 1970s has been the Paedophile Information Exchange and its unexpected link to the National Council for Civil Liberties, a disinterment that has discomforted senior figures in the Labour party and brought a reminder that when it comes to the past, especially of politicians, it is, as Faulkner said, never dead. It is not even past. Instead it can return decades later, with venom.</p><p>It's a reminder too that what can seem&nbsp;enlightened and progressive in one era can look very different years later. It's a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/17/eugenics-skeleton-rattles-loudest-closet-left\" title=\"\">shock now to read</a>, for example, that the great luminaries of the pre-war intellectual elite, especially on the left, were in thrall to eugenics, a theory of human selection which strikes us today as morally indefensible but which, at the time, was nothing less than the common sense of the age.</p><p>Merely saying, \"It was a different time\" doesn't work as a defence, a point that Patricia Hewitt has wisely understood. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/27/patricia-hewitt-paedophile-information-exchange\" title=\"\">She has apologised</a> for the decision she took, as general secretary of the NCCL, to put her name to a March 1976 press release, proposing that the age of consent be lowered to 14 or even 10 \"where consent of a child … can be proved\". The NCCL document further argued that incest between consenting persons was no crime. Now Hewitt admits: \"I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so.\"</p><p>Some will praise Hewitt for being smarter than Harriet Harman, the former legal officer of the NCCL whose responses to the PIE revelations have been more tortured. But this is not a matter of superior judgment. Hewitt surely had no option but to admit her error and show contrition. As the boss, and with her name on that document she was much more closely implicated than Harman has been. Proposing that a 10-year-old can consent to sex with an adult is far more serious than any action so far attributed to Labour's deputy leader. Still, it would have cost Harman nothing to say, the instant this story broke, that the NCCL's affiliation arrangements were clearly a mess if they allowed a group such as PIE to join. Perhaps the fear of conceding even an inch to the Mail enemy blinded her to that obvious point.</p><p>What neither Hewitt nor Harman can quite say is that the Mail's attack depends on an unspoken assumption that the NCCL crowd were uniquely indulgent of PIE and paedophilia – that, while everyone else back then shared the revulsion we feel today towards child abusers, these crackpot lefty libertarians were inexplicably permissive. But that assumption is wrong.</p><p>The clue is in the name. The activists of the PIE did not hide who they were: they put the word \"paedophile\" on the tin. They had named spokesmen and a letterhead (featuring a line-drawing of two bare-limbed children on a rock). The existence of such an unashamed group is unimaginable now. \"Paedophile\" is the worst possible insult, languishing in the moral hierarchy somewhere between \"racist\" and \"murderer\", if not, in fact, below both of them.</p><p>Yet it was clearly not that way 40 years ago. The PIE men felt they could hold their heads up, not just among the libertarians of the NCCL but in British society in general. PIE did interviews with the media. A colleague recalls seeing a PIE stall at a university conference. If you called the PIE members' hotline, it was answered by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/26/lobbying-paedophile-campaign-revealed-hewitt\" title=\"\">a chap who worked at the Home Office</a>.</p><p>It's hard for us to credit it, but it seems paedophilia did not carry quite the radioactive stigma it does today. Or maybe it's not so hard to understand. For what was one of the recurring themes of the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall revelations? That these men hid in plain sight, that their excessive interest in very young people was barely concealed: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AGoPZK_mEI\" title=\"\">in Savile's case, he all but molested one girl</a> on camera.</p><p>By their actions, these men signalled their confidence that society was ready to look the other way, if not to indulge their behaviour. That they got away with their crimes for so long suggests they were not wrong.</p><p>This is perilously awkward territory, but a look back at the popular culture of earlier eras reveals the difference with today. When Shirley Temple died earlier this month, several critics noted that her best-known performances – say, the toddler singing The Good Ship Lollipop before a watching group of adult men – now look downright creepy. Some noticed it at the time. In 1938 Graham Greene was sued for libel after writing <a href=\"http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/our-man-in-london-20090821\" title=\"\">a review</a> of one Temple movie that argued that the child was presented as a sex object: \"Her admirers – middle-aged men and clergymen – respond to her dubious coquetry, to the sight of her well-shaped and desirable little body, packed with enormous vitality, only because the safety curtain of story and dialogue drops between their intelligence and their desire.\" When Hewitt and Harman were at the helm of the NCCL, one of the hit songs of the age was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU9fClvdo5s\" title=\"\">Gilbert O'Sullivan's Clair</a>. Doubtless, it was no more than an innocent tribute to a friend's young daughter but no singer would dare write such <a href=\"http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/gilbert_osullivan/clair.html\" title=\"\">lyrics</a> today: \"You're more than a child, oh, Clair … But why in spite of our age difference do I cry each time I leave you / I feel I could die / Nothing means more to me / Than hearing you say / I'm going to marry you.\"</p><p>The point is, it's more than the attitudes of the NCCL that strike us now as alien: it's the attitudes of that whole era. Our shock is infused with a kind of generational smugness: look how much we've evolved since then. Some of that is richly justified. It's a step forward that we now understand what clearly eluded many liberals at the time: that there can be no such thing as meaningful \"consent\" from a child when it comes to a sexual encounter with an adult. It is abuse.</p><p>But there should be a limit to our generation's self-satisfaction. We have our own confusions. We believe a child cannot consent to sex until 16; yet we say they are old enough to be criminally responsible at 10. Nor is today's pop culture free of the habit of seeing children sexually: witness, as Harman has rightly pointed out, the Mail's <a href=\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhTepDKCYAA4SgP.jpg\" title=\"\">drooling coverage</a> of celebrity kids and their bodies.</p><p>Above all, while we may be better at shunning paedophiles, we're not so good at convicting them. We may have succeeded in driving child abusers underground, but the problem is still there – manifested in the proliferation of child porn on the internet, in underage sex-tourism and, tragically, in thousands of families every day of the week.</p><p>The glum truth is that this is a sickness that clings to our society. It did then and it does now. Exposing the blind spots of would-be politicians 40 years ago allows us to pretend that this ailment somehow belongs in our past. It&nbsp;doesn't. It lives with us still.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@Freedland</em></a></p>","headline":"This generational smugness about paedophilia is wrong","trailText":"<p><strong>Jonathan Freedland: </strong>Yes, the NCCL's tolerance of PIE in the 1970s is shocking.

A spokesperson for Harman (who was not working for NCCL at the time of the lobbying for lowering of the age of consent) has dismissed the allegations as \"untrue and ridiculous\".</p><p>Certainly, there's a whiff of mischief about the sudden reappearance of this story (first rehearsed in the <em>Mail</em> late last year). You can almost picture the rightwing hatchet gleefully swinging at the \"Labour grandees\"-cum-\"paedophile apologists\". And yesterday, the paper's coverage moved from stories about PIE into large-scale child sex abuse and infiltration of children's care homes; where none of the three Labour figures are implicated in any way.</p><p>And yet the mischief does not invalidate the stories, nor mean that there are not questions to answer.</p><p>Of course, events at the NCCL need to be placed into context – taking into account the ideological spirit of the times. This was at the height of the much-lampooned \"woolly\" radical-left, boundary-smashing, ultra-inclusive freethinking – often admirable, but also, at times, misguided, even disastrous (as we might be seeing). Is it fair to take decisions made during this fluctuating, charged period (even very poor ones) out of context?</p><p>Then again, helping a paedophile group lobbying to lower the age of consent so drastically (and the rest) – what could they have been thinking? If what amounted to an almighty contest of progressive thought went too far, and the NCCL in any way legitimised a gruesome group such as the PIE, then this needs to be addressed.</p><p>So, while this should not turn into a witch–hunt, it does not matter that it was a long time ago (the&nbsp;pros and cons of \"historical\" issues have been amply covered with Savile, among other issues). Likewise, while the Labour trio should not be branded \"paedophile apologists\" on the strength of an old story, it would also be a grave mistake for them to stay silent or curtly dismissive, perhaps hoping that the claims will magically disappear. (Dream on.)</p><p>While context is required, the fact remains that some very disturbing things went down, including the legitimising of a group that wasn't even bothering to hide the word \"paedophile\" in its name. Who would want their own good name indelibly attached to something like this, especially without sufficient reply?</p><p>There is still space here for Hewitt, Harman and Dromey to \"grab the conch\", as it were, to calmly tell their version of events, in context, explaining exactly what happened at the NCCL, and, where applicable, expressing regret. A calm, thorough, intelligent response is required to cut through the smokescreen of mischief and hysteria; they should answer the myriad important questions and issues arising from that time.</p><h2>It was the worst of times for a tale of two Ziggys</h2><p>So David Bowie asked Kate Moss to say: \"Scotland, stay with us\" on his behalf while collecting his award at the Brits.</p><p>Some Scottish people were infuriated, but I'm sure that many others rolled about laughing.</p><p>What is interesting is that Bowie completely miscalculated the new life cycle of celebrity controversy, in that you can no longer just say stuff, cause <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/david-bowies-plea-scotland-stay-3168336\" title=\"\">a bit of a stir</a> and that's the last anyone hears of it.</p><p>As Bowie found out, these days, you get a huge, instant, and (ahem) robust response from people who are not averse to attacking your legend and back catalogue. The moral of the tale: show up to awards ceremonies, or don't show up, but the era of the stand-alone statement has passed.</p><p>As a side issue, I'm not sure about Moss in the vintage Ziggy Stardust outfit. It resembled one of those towelling jobs mums stick on their kids if they can't be bothered to dry them properly after swimming.</p><p>It was also a tad predictable to do Ziggy. A little creative thinking, taking in Bowie's lengthy varied career into account (Mossy dressing as Tin Machine or the Laughing Gnome, perhaps?), wouldn't have gone amiss.</p><h2>For heaven's sake, won't someone give George a hug?</h2><p>Is George Osborne all right or is he crying out for a cuddle from his so-called political friends? I ask because it's as if he's hell-bent on scoring gold in the male midlife crisis Olympics.</p><p>He's gone on the <a href=\"http://thefastdiet.co.uk/the-weight-loss-is-good-but-the-rest-is-great-as-well/\" title=\"\">5:2 diet</a>, which, for the non-initiated, is where you eat normally for five days, and fast for two. Does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\" title=\"\">Osborne</a> realise that many people are doing the same diet the other way around – not eating properly for most of the week, but because they can't afford to?</p><p>Osborne has also messed with his delightful \"<a href=\"http://www.annerice.com/Bookshelf-VampireLestat.html\" title=\"\">Vampire Lestat</a>\" locks, which have long been admired chez Ellen. If a politician can't slightly remind you of a foppish vampire character from an Anne Rice novel, then what's the point of them?</p><p>Osborne is going for a more serious \"prime ministerial\" cut that, unfortunately, resembles a hair-lawn mown by an over-zealous bob-a-jobber.</p><p>Then there is all that sweaty public jogging, which led to Ed Balls challenging Osborne to a marathon. Have a heart, Ed. Look at George pumping away, brazenly flaunting his body, in his tight little shorts, and tell me: is this really just jogging or, rather, a man-cry for help? I'm gravely concerned that Osborne has become confused about his place in the world. What he needs now is some validation and support. Someone gruffly to tell him: \"Don't worry, Georgie, you've still got it. We still love you, we still think you're really good at sums and, hey, whatever rug rethink you go for, you're the cutest!\" Is this happening or has George been coldly abandoned to his fate? You have to wonder, where are all the touchy-feely metrosexual Conservatives now that their chancellor really needs them?</p>","headline":"Labour trio can't stay silent on this paedophile

Let me be clear from the outset that I have never supported PIE, being one among many radical feminists who were beginning to recognise child sexual abuse in the 1970s. But we knew so little then about its scale, and were debating sexologists and others who argued it was not necessarily harmful; this was not just a discourse of abusers, it was articulated in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports\" title=\"Wikipedia: Kinsey Reports entry\">Kinsey Reports</a> and by a range of respected academics.</p><p>From a different direction, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Liberation_Front\" title=\"Wikipedia: GLF entry\">Gay Liberation Front</a> (GLF) was struggling against widespread disgust at the existence and visibility of lesbians and gay men, not to mention routine discrimination. They saw themselves as the voice of \"sexual minorities\", and PIE cleverly attached itself to this banner, partly aided by the widespread conflation at the time of gay men with paedophilia. These were the days of gay liberation, women's liberation and, yes, children's liberation. \"Children's rights\" was an oxymoron in those times, which also created a space in which their \"right\" to sexuality could be articulated. So PIE literature at the time focused on this, and their status as a sexual minority, which in some peoples' eyes was legitimated through the alliance with GLF.</p><p>Libertarians of all political stripes were involved in these discussions. There were many unholy alliances in the debates about sexuality which appear now, 40 years later,  unfathomable. But we are reading the past through the present – through a present in which the word paedophile has become incendiary rhetoric, evoking monstrous others who have placed themselves outside the bounds of humanity. This is <a href=\"http://www.troubleandstrife.org/articles/issue-33/\" title=\"Trouble and Strife website\">why I called it a \"weasel word\" in 1996</a> – it expresses outrage at sexual abuse of children at the cost of understanding: understanding that children are abused by men that they know, men that are part of our families, communities, institutions and neighbourhoods.</p><p>Feminists began to learn about child sexual abuse in consciousness-raising groups, the first survey on the extent was <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sexually_victimized_children.html?id=fWpHAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"Google books: Sexually victimized children, by David Finkelhor\">done in the US in 1979</a>, and when I began my PhD in 1980 it was not yet on the radar of social workers and police as a significant issue in the lives of children.</p><p>This is the context in which PIE and NCCL were operating. Harriet Harman has been excoriated for the position NCCL adopted on \"indecent images of children\" – but here too the times were ones where expanding sexual freedoms was an important thread in progressive politics, and a distinction made between images and actions. It was only in the late 1980s that the argument that child pornography (now known as child abuse images) was a record of abuse was accepted, and it took even longer for legislation to reflect this.</p><p>Radical feminists were among those who critiqued PIE, not in the words of a 1979 article in the Sunday People as \"the vilest men in Britain\", but through what we were learning about the harms of sexual abuse and our analysis that power relations between adults and children make all sexual contact abusive.

She's angry too, she tells Decca Aitkenhead, and rethinking everything from MP selection to proportional representation","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2009-06-06T18:08:07Z","body":"<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday 6 June 2009.</strong></p><p>The profile below said that Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, did the impossible ... \"trained as a QC\". In any case, she qualified as a solicitor</p><p><hr /></p><p>'Come over here and meet Bob,\" Harriet Harman beckons. \"He's been telling me how he feels about MPs' expenses. Tell Decca,\" she says, turning to Bob, \"what you've just been telling me.\"</p><p>Has Harman managed to find the one voter in Britain who thinks MPs have been unjustly maligned? This will be interesting, I think. </p><p>We're outside a primary school in the minister's south London constituency, where Harman is leafleting as parents drop their kids off in the morning - not canvassing, \"just making myself visible\". She does something like this at a local school most weeks, but seldom, if ever, in a more hostile public mood. Had her own expenses claims not been revealed as relatively blameless, I doubt the mums would be smiling at her. Bob isn't smiling, though, and nor is Harman as she listens.</p><p>\"I've been a Labour voter all my life,\" Bob says. \"I always vote, always have, at every election. So does my wife. And I tell you this, I won't be voting this time. We're shocked, disgusted, angry and hurt. I cannot believe what MPs have been doing. I'm so upset about it, I don't know what to do.\" </p><p>I glance across at Harman, and she is nodding. \"I'm so sorry, Bob,\" she says quietly. \"It is awful.\"</p><p>Since the revelations of expenses claims broke, many ministers have been conspicuous by their absence, but Harman has been more like a human shield, touring TV studios, absorbing the rage, struggling to maintain what's left of an election campaign in the face of Armageddon. I'd never met her, but over the years had digested an impression of a somewhat humourless, tightly wound attack dog. Here on the street, though, is someone quite unexpected - open, warm and willing to take all the anger this voter has to vent. \"It's still building up,\" she offers frankly when Bob has gone. \"It's getting more, getting worse rather than better.\"</p><p>When we meet again later that day in her Whitehall office, she says she can't remember the last time she had a day off. She should look shattered, but like a surprising number of politicians, she's better looking than she appears on TV: softer, less staring-eyed, more human. There's not a trace of the pomp of high office in the room; her aides are a Scottish former stand-up and a smiley young man in skinny jeans and trainers, and when she talks about the technical details of expenses claims, she jokes, \"Anorak on\" and mimes pulling one over her head. She plonks herself down on the sofa as if we were just here for a chat, then gets up to fetch her specs. \"If I get my glasses, my brain will operate more dynamically,\" she smiles briskly. \"Right!\"</p><p>Did she have any idea what was coming in the expenses revelations? \"Well, I ... I knew I didn't know. It's Donald Rumsfeld's known unknown. It was definitely a known unknown.\" As an inner London MP, she'd never had any dealings with the second home allowances, she stresses, and \"if there are discussions going on somewhere, where people discuss how to maximise your income by flipping or something like that, if there's a kind of network and sharing of worst practice, I've never come across it.\" </p><p>So was she shocked? \"Yeah, I have been shocked. I did think that when it came out it might be ...\" She lets the sentence fall away. \"I don't want to sit in judgment on people but, no, my imagination has not been equal to the task of anticipating. And there's still more to come out - there's the office costs, then there's the travel, so we're still in the process. I think the distrust is going to deepen.\"</p><p>She is choosing her words with care, not only, I suspect, for fear of appearing to sit in judgment. Having been one of just 10 women MPs when first elected in 1982, at seven months pregnant, she has long been a critic of the gentlemen's club culture, and while many of her colleagues are calling this crisis a catastrophe, to reformers it is also an unmistakable opportunity. Is she secretly glad that it's all come out? \"I think, um, I think it's going to be ... ultimately, I think it's going to be ... it's going to have been the spur for a very fundamental root and branch review of the allowances, and putting them on a statutory footing, and making sure the system is proof against abuse, and the system will be better, and the public will be able to have more confidence.\" </p><p>That sounds like a yes. \"I don't want to be saying this is a great opportunity,\" she says, looking uncomfortable. </p><p>But it is a great opportunity, isn't it? She hesitates for a moment. \"It is a moment to be seized, yes,\" she says softly. \"There's no doubt about it.\"</p><p>Then something surprising happens. I'd expected to have to make the argument for some radical catharsis - a lancing of the boil - before the detail of any reform can begin to be discussed, but she makes it for me. \"You can't begin to mobilise that moment, or take that opportunity, whilst the electorate are so utterly disillusioned. Until such time as the public join in with that discussion, it's not one worth having. And at the moment they don't want to be joining in. You can't even begin to have a discussion with somebody about\" - she adopts a silly voice - \"'Oh, let's renew our democracy' when they wouldn't want to talk about it to us. Bob doesn't want to be having a discussion about how you'd engage in all the wider issues, because that trust has got to be rebuilt first, before people will engage in how we can use this moment to strengthen democracy. Democracy is not for us, it's for them. And until they're prepared to have a discussion with us about how we renew democracy, there's no renewing to be done.\"</p><p>She has already announced interim expenses reforms, including a new Parliamentary Standards Authority, but the implication of what she's just said is that first something much more drastic has to happen. This is what her critics are demanding - and if she agrees with them, I can't see the argument against calling for a wholesale reselection of every single sitting MP. \"But that process is happening,\" she protests. Labour MPs whose claims have brought the party into disrepute will face a scrutiny panel, and the prospect of deselection. \"But it's not going to happen in respect of every single MP, because what's the point?\"</p><p>The point would be that if the public now think all MPs are on the make, and Harman is insisting they're not, only wholesale reselection would restore faith in the surviving MPs. \"But I'm not quite sure how it helps the public's mind for me to go through that procedure,\" she says, \"because it would just be a 'tick box' thing. What's the point?\"</p><p>In her case, I agree, it would be a short process. And across the country, any inconvenience would be modest compared with the magnitude of the crisis in trust. Like all reselected MPs, Harman would then be able to look voters in the eye, say she'd been through the same scrutiny as everyone else and proved that her hands were clean. There is a thoughtful pause. \"Hmmm,\" she says. Then, \"Mmmm. You mean, we'd get a sort of charter mark? Like Ofsted. Ofpol, it would be like Ofpol.\" </p><p>Exactly. After all, even when we know a school is excellent, Ofsted still does an inspection. \"I'll have to think about that ... But there's a whole load who've done absolutely nothing wrong. And we don't want to create a climate where we encourage the notion that everybody is under suspicion.\" </p><p>But that climate already exists. Surely it can be dispelled now only by making everyone go through that process. She thinks again. \"It might be that actually, instead of us not encouraging the notion, we're not responding to the level of reassurance people need,\" she says thoughtfully. Then she looks up at me. \"It might be that you're right.\"</p><p>The other option, of course, would be a general election. Why not just be done with it and call one? \"But there is going to be a general election within the year anyway, so I feel my responsibility as leader of the House is to work hard to sort out the system to put it on a better footing, and then all parties of the political system will be on a better footing to face the electorate and say we've cleared out the system. We've got a problem and we've got to sort it out, and I feel it's our responsibility collectively to sort out the problem.\"</p><p>But when a school is failing, the government always says get rid of the head and put in a new team, because the old one clearly doesn't know how to turn the school around. \"But this is not just an issue for the Labour party, this is an issue that has affected all parties.\" </p><p>Yes, but even though the Tories and Lib Dems are implicated, they're still calling for a general election, so why isn't she? \"If there was a big choice for the voters - here's the party that wants to clean up politics and here's the one that doesn't - then that would, you know, then that would - I mean - I think that when the ...\" She breaks off, looking less than convinced by her own words. \"There will be a general election within a year,\" she begins again more firmly, \"but I think really our task is to sort out the problem, and not throw everything up into the air and say, right, let's call an election. I'm absolutely convinced that our responsibility is to sort the situation out, definitely.\"</p><p>It's such a bafflingly weak argument that it can't be what she really means. Isn't the worry that voter turnout would be so low that whoever won would have a pitiful mandate - yet, like all new governments, would have little enthusiasm for reforming a system that had just delivered them to office? \"Perhaps you've made an argument for sorting it out before an election.\"</p><p>But why is she not making it? \"Oh, right. Gosh. Well, it was a very good point. I was intending to make it myself, you understand,\" and we both laugh. She makes a brief note, looks up and adds: \"Actually, I think if we don't sort out the situation before the next general election, there will be a very low turnout, there's no doubt about it. And therefore we've got to win back their confidence and trust in order to make the general election something that delivers a mandate.\" </p><p>Harman is the cabinet's second longest serving MP, has served in all but three years of the Labour government, and currently holds no fewer than four jobs - deputy leader, secretary of state for women and equality, chair of the Labour party and leader of the Commons. Now 58, she trained as a QC before becoming legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty) in the late 70s, and her closest admirers include some of the brightest in cabinet, such as Ed Miliband. </p><p>Yet for years she has been dogged by the charge that she is not very bright. Frank Field famously described her as \"thick\", while to others she is too posh to be quite credible: the daughter of a Harley Street consultant and a niece of Lord Longford, she was privately educated at St Paul's Girls' School. Her decision to send her three children to selective, though state, schools enraged some Labour loyalists, and when the late Tory grandee Alan Clark was asked whom he found more attractive, Harman or Edwina Currie, he replied, \"Oh, Harriet, of course. It's simply a matter of class.\"</p><p>But in a government that has featured no shortage of millionaire men, it would be odd to single out as some sort of upper-class infidel a woman who once said she has \"never spent more than &pound;50\" on a handbag and who for 27 years has been married to the trade unionist Jack Dromey, whom she met on a picket line. </p><p>If anything has hampered Harman, it has probably been her feminism. Mocking incredulity that her first parliamentary question to Margaret Thatcher concerned after-school clubs led to lobby jokes about \"Hattie Harperson\", which continue to this day, despite, as she points out, the transition of women's concerns into mainstream politics. She once joked that, should she become prime minister, \"There aren't enough airports in the country for all the men who would want to flee\", and her equality bill currently going through parliament would give employers the right, on grounds of gender, to choose an equally qualified woman over a male candidate. The only serious contender to have categorically ruled herself out of any future leadership race, Harman has been a loyal Kinnockite, Smithite, Blairite and now Brownite, yet still a whispering campaign persists against her, and she's accused of exploiting her deputy leader's mandate to pursue some militant feminist agenda of her own. </p><p>But you don't get to be where Harman is today without sacrificing your feminism unless you are, in fact, very smart. Those critics who think she has her eye on the main job may interpret her warnings that \"things will get worse\", and her very public sympathy for Bob, as evidence of opportunistic ambition. I certainly don't find her stupid; on the contrary, what she seems to be doing is thinking - with a more open mind and greater willingness to listen than most ministers I've met, and a world away from the pointless point-scoring of a New Labour automaton. Our meeting is a rare and surprising thing - less like an interview than an exchange of ideas, an actual conversation. </p><p>For example, when I ask if she would support the addition of \"None Of The Above\" to ballot papers, at first she says we already have that option by abstaining. \"None Of The Above is not voting.\" </p><p>But not voting could mean anything; it could mean I forgot to vote, or couldn't get to the polls, whereas None Of The Above is an unambiguous democratic expression, currently unavailable to the electorate. \"Mmmm,\" she murmurs. \"Bob did say he'd vote for None Of The Above if he could.\" </p><p>Politicians rarely quote anyone who disagrees with them, yet Harman repeatedly invokes Bob, regardless of how critical his comments. Bob is practically turning into our own Joe the Plumber - \"You'd better change his name,\" she says (I have), \"or the poor man will have the press all over him.\" But whereas John McCain kept quoting Joe's attack on Barack Obama, this is more like Obama invoking Joe's criticisms himself. Harman's thinking on reform does seem remarkably fluid: when she describes it as an \"ongoing situation\", she means it. \"I don't think,\" she admits, \"I've made up my mind about this None Of The Above question.\" She smiles: \"Am I allowed to have 'Neither Of The Above' - neither yes nor no?\" Would she support Alan Johnson's call for a referendum on proportional representation? \"Well, I do think that the public preparedness to think about these things is much more than it was. There's a whole load of things that have got their moment in the sun now, from changing the hours of the House to all the issues around the electoral system.\" So would she back Johnson's idea in cabinet? \"I would be more positive than negative,\" she says. So, in principle, she would not oppose it? \"No.\"</p><p>When Harman is unforthcoming, it is usually with reason. She won't comment on whether Michael Martin should receive the customary peerage conferred on a former speaker, nor for whom she will vote to replace him, because, \"as leader of the House, I'm just not going to do that.\" When I suggest that, despite the monstrous extravagance of many Tory expenses claims, the crisis is playing well for David Cameron, she says, \"You know, how it plays for him, we'll just have to leave to him. I'm averse to the notion of 'playing' this any way at all. If Bob felt I was playing this, that would be the final, final straw. So my approach has not been to play politics with all of this.\"</p><p>But voters seem to approve of Cameron's angry condemnation of colleagues. His actions may have been high-handed - \"Or about wanting,\" she interjects, \"to get rid of a load of his MPs because they never liked him and he never liked them\" - yet they're still being interpreted as strong leadership. \"There is a process in the Labour party, which is one that involves an element of natural justice,\" she counters firmly, \"which is that if allegations are made, people are entitled to have their say about whether or not the facts that have been put there are wrong. Natural justice and fairness can sometimes fall victim when there's a great sense of anxiety, and I'm not going to contribute to that.\"</p><p>Her defence of the Commons' tardiness in publishing all expenses claims is less convincing. Over and again, she insists it takes time to remove private details such as credit card numbers. \"I know it sounds hopelessly bureaucratic,\" she says - and frankly, it does: if the Telegraph can manage it, why can't the government? \"Well, yes, I know there has been tremendous frustration among members about why the house authorities are letting the Telegraph set the agenda.\" Does she share it? She looks awkward. \"I've got a kind of collective responsibility for that, so it's not for me to say I'd have liked to have done it earlier. But, yes, it should have been brought further forward still.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, the Telegraph reported that Harman claimed thousands for a media trainer. \"It wasn't like sitting me in front of a video camera and teaching me how to answer questions,\" she says, sounding unruffled. \"So although she is a media trainer, that doesn't actually describe what she did for me. She would edit newsletters I'd written, or annual reports, and comment on speeches I'd drafted, because I didn't have someone in the office to do that. But I didn't need someone to do these things on a full-time basis.\"</p><p>Would it be acceptable for other MPs to spend public money on private media training? \"I think that being an MP is about your commitment and the cause. It's not a technique. So, no, not really.\"</p><p>What she will not do, however, is condemn her colleagues. When I ask if she agrees with Gordon Brown that Hazel Blears's behaviour was \"totally unacceptable\", she says, \"I am not going to make pronouncements about cabinet members or any other MPs.\" She does not budge. \"I'm absolutely not going to sit in judgment on my colleagues.\"</p><p>She does, however, correct me when I say I understand that she won't pass judgment on them. \"No,\" she says, \"won't sit in judgment.\" What's the difference? \"We all make judgments. Everybody's making judgments all the time. But I'm deputy leader, so I'm not going to take myself to be judge and jury, because that's not what I was elected to do.\" So she wouldn't want voters to think she doesn't have opinions about what her colleagues have done? \"No,\" she says pointedly, \"I want voters to think I'm not sharing them.\"</p><p>Without naming names, then, does she feel angry with individuals who've abused the system? She pauses for so long that I later time the silence on the tape: it stretches to eight seconds. \"Well ...\" She pauses for another three, looking anguished. \"I don't think the public will be reassured that, oooh, Harriet's really angry.\"</p><p>Really? When people are angry, surely what they want first, more than anything, is to know their feelings are shared. The silence that follows lasts another eight seconds. Surely, I try again, the people we met at the school gates would feel reassured to know she feels exactly the same way as they do? \"No, I think I'm dismayed.\" </p><p>Why not angry? \"Because we can't have an angry competition - 'I'm more angry than you are! You think you're angry? Hey, I'm here to tell you I'm more angry!' - because that will not produce any results.\" It hasn't worked badly for Cameron, I say. \"Well, you can ask David Cameron about David Cameron,\" she retorts testily, suddenly looking exhausted. \"I'm more interested in sorting it out.\" </p><p>My hunch, I say, is that she's flaming mad with colleagues who've ripped us off. \"Mmm,\" she says quietly. \"Mmm.\" Then, in a low, almost inaudible voice, she says, \"Well, yes, perhaps I am angry.</p>","headline":"'This is a moment  to be seized - there's  no doubt about it'","trailText":"<p>Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman has been facing the public and feeling their rage over the expenses crisis.

Yet the cultural battle is far from over","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-19T23:21:02Z","body":"<p>The lawns were rather gorgeous and so were most of the guests: the sun sparkled, cabinet ministers murmured and the prime minister flirted with the Liberal Democrat man he now calls his civil partner. Is this how gay liberation was supposed to end? Not with a barricade, but a drinks party, nibbling canapes on a summer evening in the garden of No 10. A Conservative prime minister held an official event for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender Britain and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1287174/Cameron-welcomes-gay-celebrities-Number-10.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail struggled to be shocked</a>.</p><p>The ordinariness of it all confirmed a wonderful thing: the country's very rapid and far-reaching acceptance of sexual difference with little of the religious and cultural hysteria that has accompanied the struggle in, for instance, the US. Nothing felt forced about last week's event – just a routine June political reception at which the majority of guests happened to be gay or lesbian.</p><p>The Labour party, Conservatives should never forget, did much of the legislative hard work that got us here. Liberals, too, were prominent in the early campaigns. Gordon Brown welcomed gay and lesbian people into Downing Street. But now no single party can claim a stranglehold on virtue. We have reached a point where an individual's sexuality does not make them more or less welcome in one party or another. You no longer have to vote Labour or Lib Dem just because you are gay, out of gratitude for reforms or fear of what a Tory government might do.</p><p>David Cameron's ostentatious detoxification has touched on cringeworthy – we can take \"pride in pride, as well as pride in our football team\", he told his guests the other day. But the changes he has brought are real and well-meant. It is easy to play a game of match-the-voting-record-to-the-rhetoric and question Cameron's authenticity, and more so that of some members of his cabinet. The <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Work and Pensions</a> is already becoming known as the Department for Worship and Prayer, so strong are the Christian underpinnings of its ministerial team. But Cameron admits he was wrong, and that his views have changed and we should accept that.</p><p>It is worth noting in passing that the Conservative record is not all bad and Labour's not all good. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">John Major cut the age of consent from 21</a>. Tony Blair appointed a member of Opus Dei as the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/is-homosexuality-a-sin-minister-for-equality-refuses-to-rule-it-out-477554.html\" title=\"\">equalities minister</a>. This year <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8582868.stm\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman lobbied to stop the Equalities Act being amended to allow civil partnership ceremonies</a> to take place in religious institutions, least her law fall foul of cantankerous bishops. Meanwhile Chris Grayling, who expressed the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/03/tory-tape-gays-bed-breakfast\" title=\"\">foolish but intellectually defensible position that the owners of private guest houses should be able to deny gay couples a bed</a>, found himself demoted several rungs down the ministerial ladder.</p><p>But overall this is an issue Labour got right, as the Conservative <a href=\"http://www.nickboles.com/\" title=\"\">MP Nick Boles</a> said in a generous maiden speech the other day. \"I would not be standing here today if they had not passed legislation to extend full equality and respect to everyone in Britain – and thereby entrench a change in culture and attitudes that my own party has now embraced. This was the Labour party at its best: brave, principled and humane.\"</p><p>The political battle is won – though the cultural one is far from over. We are running out of laws that need to be changed. This is the moment to pack away the pink fake fur tutus and the diamante fairy wands. Group identity is more than anything a product of repression. The fact that someone is gay or lesbian need no longer be their primary defining characteristic: it can be in the background or foreground as they choose, part of their genetic identity.</p><p>So I suppose I should welcome the fact that Stonewall's chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/30/david-laws-homosexuality-parliamentary-expenses\" title=\"\">Ben Summerskill, turned on David Laws in print</a>. \"How can anyone 'represent' a community of interest if they're unable ever to admit they belong to it and can speak of their own lived experience?\" Summerskill asked. He thinks that we have reached a point where everyone in politics should find it possible to come out and yet everyone who is out should be duty-bound to define themselves prominently by their sexuality.</p><p>I think he is wrong on both points and that Laws got himself into a mess primarily because he was gay and not because he was greedy. Laws never asked to represent any community other than his Yeovil constituency. Yet those, like me, who found Summerskill's criticisms of Laws ill-judged and partisan, might reflect that we have achieved a sort of maturity when the leading gay rights group no longer feels the need to defend a minister whose sexuality is splashed all over the papers. Leftwing gay men can now disagree with rightwing gay men without any threat to a shared cause.</p><p>Discrimination remains: gay men cannot give blood. The national church remains a bastion of unequal treatment. Homophobic bullying is common in schools. YouGov polling found one in eight lesbian, gay and bisexual adults are victims of homophobic incidents each year. In arguing that the political battle is won I don't mean to suggest everything is perfect. But other elements in society, less articulate, less well-connected, perhaps not courted by politicians, suffer worse discrimination now. So thanks for the white wine, prime minister, but it's time we were moving on.</p>","headline":"This is the moment to pack away the diamante wands","trailText":"<strong>Julian Glover:</strong> As the No 10 drinks party showed, the political battle over sexual politics is won.

Harman</h2><p>What to make of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/oct/07/harriet-harman-shadow-culture-secretary\" title=\"\"><strong>Harriet Harman</strong></a> as the new shadow culture secretary – a job she'll combine with chairmanship and deputy leadership of the Labour party? For a start, Harman's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/08/harriet-harman-100-women\" title=\"\">far too powerful</a> within the party to have had the job imposed upon her; she must have wanted a policy area to dig into. But as for the arts part of the role, it's hard to see it looming large when her immediate concerns will surely be the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry</a> and – let it be hoped – a defence of the BBC.</p><p>She is not someone who has made much of the arts in her political career to date, but there's plenty of music in her family: her daughter, Amy Harman, has just become joint principal bassoonist of London's Philharmonia Orchestra. And&nbsp;these things do matter: <strong>David Miliband</strong>, when at the department of education, was influential in promoting music education. No coincidence that his wife was, and is, a violinist in the London Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>Harman's not afraid of political knockabout, and of course she is fantastically experienced, so it will be&nbsp;interesting to see how she tackles culture secretary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> head-on. Finally, the consistent thread through her career has been her feminism: and frankly, we just can't have enough of that in the arts. Or anywhere, for that matter.</p><p></p><h2>Bad smells in California</h2><p>A mole from <strong>San Francisco Opera</strong> has passed me a memo&nbsp;sent around the company. \"Dear&nbsp;Artists &amp; Staff,\" it begins. \"PLEASE REFRAIN FROM WEARING ANY TYPE OF FRAGRANCE (PERFUME, STRONG HAIR SPRAY, SHAVING COLOGNE, ETC.) AT ANY REHEARSAL OR PERFORMANCE. Many people are allergic to fragrant products; this allergy can prove damaging to the singer's vocal cords, not to mention the miserable symptoms. We are often all in very close proximity and it is very important that we all take the time to be thoughtful and considerate regarding the use of fragrances.\" You can just <em>tell</em> there's some madly prima-donnaish singer behind this. They'll have only themselves to blame when they have to inhale Eau de Sweaty Tenor, unleavened by a hint of Chanel.</p><h2>Fiennes in art-world spoof</h2><p><strong>Elmgreen and Dragset </strong>entertained visitors to the 2009 Venice Biennale with their mordant work <a href=\"http://vernissage.tv/blog/2009/06/19/elmgreen-dragset-the-collectors-at-venice-biennial-2009-interview-with-ingar-dragset/\" title=\"\">The Collectors</a>, which saw the Nordic and Danish pavilions transformed into art aficionados' homes, one of which featured a dead collector face-down in his pool. The Scandinavian duo have now written a play, Happy Days in the Art World, starring <strong>Joseph Fiennes</strong>, Charles Edwards and Kim Criswell.</p><p>It is, says Michael Elmgreen, a Beckettian (big clue in the title) look at&nbsp;their own existence, \"with biographical stuff from our lives as well as a lot of lies\". The main characters will, says&nbsp;Elmgreen, be \"cynical and humorous and it will be very unflattering; if the play also makes&nbsp;fun of others, it certainly makes more fun of ourselves\". It&nbsp;opens in New York next month, at the Skirball Centre for the Performing Arts.

But I'm with Pope Benedict on this one | Simon Jenkins","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-02T20:30:00Z","sectionName":"Comment is free","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/belief/2010/feb/02/pope-benedict-harman-equalities-bill","fields":{"standfirst":"The pope's right to practise what he preaches needs defending in the face of Harriet Harman's intolerant equalities bill","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-06-16T22:41:16Z","body":"<p>The pope is right and ­Harriet Harman is wrong. I might prefer the ­opposite to be the case but, on the matter in hand, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/10/david-mitchell-free-speech\" title=\"\">Voltaire's ­principle</a> should apply. The ­Roman Catholic church may be a hotbed of religious prejudice, indoctrination and, somewhere in the United Kingdom, social division. But faced with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/jun/27/equality.constitution\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman's equality bill</a> and her utopian campaign to straighten all the rough timber of mankind, the pope's right to practise what he preaches needs defending.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/02/equality-laws-unjust-pope-uk\" title=\"\">pope's complaint</a>, in his outspoken announcement yesterday of his visit to Britain in September, is that Catholics are being denied an important human right: to decide their own employment criteria for those working in churches and schools or applying to Catholic adoption agencies. The particular issue is homosexuality. Regarding homosexuals as unsuitable may be outdated, even odious, but it does not require the state to force private institutions to employ those whose character or habits they regard as not for them.</p><p>An idiot objection is that anyone who defends a pope is defending the comprehensively indefensible. Certainly I disagree even with the terms in which Pope Benedict expressed his dissent. I do not believe that denying him an aspect of his religious freedom is \"contrary to natural law\" or even inherently \"unjust\". No one, as the pope implied, is \"disputing the gospel's right to be heard\".</p><p>I deplore the attitude of the Catholic church to homosexuality, veiled as it is in decades of a hypocrisy whose consequences for many young people are only now coming to light. The church's historic aversion to religious debate and dissent, its pathological conservatism, its veneration of relics, its cruelty to its own adherents and its necrophilia make the pope's plea for tolerance ring hollow.</p><p>That is beside the point. It might be comfortable for liberals simply to grant the pope the \"human right\" to express his views and no more. But a truly free society is not like Solzhenitsyn's Soviet asylum, where freedom of speech is permitted only to those safely certified and incarcerated in prison. Tolerance must be shown not just to an opinion but to the personal and group behaviour that results from that opinion – within the customary limits of reasonableness.</p><p>That the pope might support the suppression of abortion clinics does not justify Harman's suppression of Catholic adoption agencies. But then I have little doubt that if Harman were a Catholic she would be stamping out clinics with the most draconian of powers. The avowedly socialist drift of her bill is \"not only to build a new economic order but a new social order\", a social order of her own devising. People with such ambition are usually intolerant of others, and often dangerous. Harman's interest is not social equality – which her government has conspicuously ignored – but state control.</p><p>Religion has been the curse of political reform in Britain since the middle ages. Turn every stone of history and lurking beneath is some bigotry, some tribal prejudice. The hypocrisy is often staggering, even today. The cabinet of which Harman has been a member for a decade has promoted and subsidised faith schools, allowing them to do what she is banning the Catholic church from doing – that is, use religion as a tool of human discrimination. Many people regard the consequence of faith schools as more widespread and communally divisive than the hiring practices of the Catholic church. Why is Harman doing nothing to end them?</p><p>There are still large numbers of Britons who are uncomfortable with those whose behaviour diverges from what they see as traditional norms. These conservatives have swallowed much this past half-century, as authoritarianism has been steadily eradicated by liberal legislation on homosexuality, abortion, divorce and free speech. Occasionally the liberalism has looked more like intolerance, as over smoking and aspects of \"hate speech\". Indeed to some people, liberalism's onward march has seemed more like a jackboot in the face. A few have reacted by retreating into a know-nothing fundamentalism, as witnessed in many parts of America.</p><p>Harman is one of those Labour ministers whom no one would describe as a defender of liberty. Her obsession with monitoring and registering a third of all adults for child abuse potential has gone far beyond reasonable intrusion. Her campaign against domestic violence stands to her credit, but she cannot walk down a street without screaming for a policeman to find out what the world is doing and telling it to stop. Her public defence of the Home Office's annual anti-terror laws is typical of the cabinet's cavalier attitude to civil liberty.</p><p>British liberalism has had a good half-century, but has begun to lurch into the intolerance it purports to oppose. It should loosen up and acknowledge that some communal space must be allowed the old illiberalism. At least it should join <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/oct/26/comment.martinkettle\" title=\"\">John Locke</a> in discussing how much of that space is appropriate in a free society.</p><p>The churches continue to enjoy too much status in British life. It remains extraordinary that Anglicanism's senior figures, the bishops, enjoy legislative power ex officio. If bishops, why not other professions? I would have no compunction in phasing out public subsidy to all faith schools, as even that impeccable churchman Gladstone sought in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/may/12/society.publicservices\" title=\"\">1870 Education Act</a>. He was balked by the legislative clout of the bishops, a clout that has continued ever since.</p><p></p><p>In reality, <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/articles/a0000558.shtml\" title=\"\">11 Catholic adoption ­agencies</a> out of 480 were hardly a monument to bigotry. A celibate Catholic chaplaincy or a Christian school headship is hardly a knife at the heart of social equality, any more than a men's club, a women's novel prize, or some miserable smokers loitering outside an office block (on whose freedom the ­government also wants to stamp).</p><p>A central tenet of liberalism is a distinction between disagreement and banishment, between distaste for another's point of view and its statutory elimination. I could ridicule the Catholic fixation on the peripatetic bones of St Thérèse of Lisieux, but I would not ban it or regard it as anything other than part of the rich tapestry of humanity. I would happily protest at the pope's visit, but not refuse to let it take place.</p><p>The ailing Catholic church, like most hallowed institutions, does much good work, and it does bad. But the bad is not an incarnation of such evil as to merit state persecution, as if this were still the 17th century. The church is its own worst enemy. It does not need Harman and her puritanical enforcers to grant its prejudice the oxygen of intolerance.</p>","headline":"An odious view, indeed.

But it's fear of what the government is up to that gets me up in the morning. It's difficult to feel  positive when your purpose is to be in politics and you're in opposition.</p><p><strong>The thought of not having sisters</strong> is fairly horrific. My sisters and I, we're an ecosystem of our own. All my childhood memories are of us playing together, and arguing. There was a girl in my school who was an only child and when people talked about her I thought they were saying \"lonely child\".</p><p><strong>I don't do tantrums,</strong> but I'm probably on the over-assertive side. I recently saw  a television clip of myself from the 1970s and I was amazed at what a timid little mouse I was, speaking in a quiet, hopeful voice under a big fringe. I thought, \"Get a grip!\" I realise I've changed a bit. I don't like taking no for an answer now.</p><p><strong>Nowadays, I don't feel I need to escape from politics</strong> because I feel comfortable where I am with it. I want things to change; I want women to be as comfortable in politics as men are. Politics is not comfortable anyway.</p><p><strong>Every year when my kids were little</strong> I threatened to throw in the towel  on being an MP. But my friends would tell me to get on with it, so I stayed.  And I'm very glad I did.</p><p><strong>When you find someone you get on with in life</strong> it is great fortune. I've been very lucky indeed – I'm still on my first marriage.</p><p><strong>It is completely untrue</strong> that you can't do anything when you're not in government. You can still speak up for people's hopes and fears and you can make change happen. Look at what happened when Ed Miliband challenged Rupert Murdoch on phone hacking.</p><p><strong>You learn more from failure</strong> than you ever learn from success. My friend  Anna Coote told me that when I was sacked from the Cabinet. It also helps to think about what you want to do next and not what you have done already.</p><p><strong>I'm sure nobody wants to know this,</strong> but my husband does all the cleaning – rather too much cleaning. It is too clean, the house!</p><p><strong>There's going to be a new generation of healthy older people,</strong> hopefully. Watch out for the \"wellderly\"! Oddly, I don't mind getting old at all.</p><p><strong>Would I go back in time?</strong> Not as a woman. All those unwanted pregnancies  and women having to defer to men? No thanks.</p><p><strong>I was once caught speeding</strong> in my own constituency when I was Solicitor General. If I had not pleaded guilty I would have had to resign as I'd have been prosecuting myself! Now that's an odd situation. When the policeman showed me the speed gun there was no doubt about it: I pleaded guilty.</p><p><strong>The weekends are what I look forward to.</strong> It's when all the family come round to the house and I cook up a storm.</p><p> <em>Harriet Harman is taking part in Cancer Research UK's </em>Turn The Tables <em>(</em><a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\" title=\"\"><em>cancerresearchuk.org</em></a><em>)</em></p>","headline":"This much I know: Harriet Harman","trailText":"<strong>Toby Helm:</strong> The shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport on learning from failure and not taking no for an answer","newspaperPageNumber":"8","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/26/1319638791845/Harriet-Harman-003.jpg","wordcount":"506","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"381000202","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5344976","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Toby Helm","newspaperEditionDate":"2011-10-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1653317","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-11-02T00:06:07Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/30/this-much-know-harriet-harman","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/30/this-much-know-harriet-harman","tags":[{"id":"lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","webTitle":"This much I know","description":"Celebrities share the lessons life has taught them","type":"series","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"politics/harrietharman","webTitle":"Harriet Harman","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/harrietharman","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tobyhelm","webTitle":"Toby Helm","r2ContributorId":"27578","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/27/toby_helm_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Toby Helm is the Observer's political editor</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tobyhelm","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/tobyhelm","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-381000539","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/26/1319638789461/Harriet-Harman-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Observer","photographer":"Harry Borden","altText":"Harriet Harman","height":"54","credit":"Harry Borden/Observer","caption":"Shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Harriet Harman.

What we have been doing at this conference this week is looking outwards to the public, and that's the most important thing of all.\"</p><p>Harman told the conference: \"This week has been a turning point. Ed [Miliband] has shown his bold and optimistic vision for the future. We've challenged the unspoken orthodoxies that have governed Britain for too long, and we've refounded our party so we can be the force that changes people's lives. Conference – let's go for it.\"</p><p>Referring to the comments by Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, who conceded mistakes had been made by Labour when in power, she said: \"The two Eds both acknowledged what we all know: that not everything we did in government turned out right.</p><p>\"People need to know that, over the past year, we've taken a hard look at what we did, and we've learned lessons. But it's time now to move on because we've got important work to do.\"</p><p>Hilary Benn, the shadow Commons Speaker, set out some of the strong decisions made by Labour in power. Labour had held its hands up about getting it wrong on banking regulation, he said, but made the \"right choice\" when it decided to part-nationalise some of the big banks when the system was on the point of collapse.</p><p>\"George Osborne used to complain not that we weren't doing enough on the banks but that we were being too tough on them,\" he said. \"He was wrong, and we'll take no lectures from him.\"</p><p>Benn told how he broke the news of the Northern Rock nationalisation to his father, the veteran leftwinger Tony Benn, saying: \"I rang my father up and said: 'Dad, you know you were always saying that we should nationalise the banks? Well, I've got some news for you.'\"</p><p></p><p>Harman rounded on government plans to introduce voluntary voter registration and put an end to households signing up, shifting the onus on to each individual to fill out the electoral forms.</p><p>She told delegates that the Lib Dems, \"to their eternal shame\", were \"colluding\" in the plans.</p><p>Ministers have unexpectedly proposed that it should no longer be compulsory to co-operate with electoral registration officers (EROs) when they try to compile an accurate register – in effect downgrading the civic duty to engage with politics.</p><p>The Electoral Commission, electoral administrators and psephologists have warned that as many as 10 million voters – predominantly poor, young or black and more liable to vote Labour – could fall off the electoral register as a result.</p><p>Harman said: \"The Tories hope it will help them win the election. This is a shameful assault on people's democratic right, and we will expose it and campaign against it. Parliament has no right to take away people's right to vote. The government cannot be allowed to get away with it.\"</p><p>Looking to the year ahead, Harman told activists Labour had important work to do in defending services such as Sure Start children's centres from closure, opposing the abolition of the 50p top rate of tax and defending the NHS.</p><p>She dismissed Lib Dem claims that they were acting as a brake on the Conservatives in coalition, saying they were instead being used to do the \"dirty work\".</p><p>Citing tuition fee rises, police cuts and the VAT rise, she added: \"Clearly, the brakes failed.\"</p><p>She highlighted the announcement of job losses at BAE Systems to accuse the Tories of being a party out of touch, saying Miliband was the only leader to understand people's fears in the current climate.</p><p>\"Behind their front doors, people are worried,\" she said. \"Behind the front door of Downing Street, the Tories are oblivious. It's not going to affect them – so it doesn't matter. They're so removed from people's lives.</p><p>\"But I do hear that they do watch TV from time to time and I hear they love Downtown Abbey. The only problem is they think it's a fly on the wall documentary.\"</p><p>Earlier in the day, Yvette Cooper, the shadow equalities minister, told delegates that women affected by government cuts would get \"angrier and angrier and louder and louder\".</p><p>Referring to David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/apr/27/david-cameron-calm-down-dear\" title=\"\">calm down, dear\"</a> jibe to the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Angela Eagle, during a Commons exchange, Cooper said the prime minister had showed his true feelings to women concerned about the coalition's deficit reduction strategy.</p><p>\"What was David Cameron's response to women who warned him about the damage he was doing? To Harriet Harman, to Caroline Flint, to Angela Eagle? Not 'sorry', but 'Calm down dear'.</p><p>\"I think David Cameron will learn that women across the country are not going to calm down. In fact, they are getting angrier and angrier and louder and louder, and they will continue to do so until this Tory-led government drops their deeply unfair plans to turn their back on women.\"</p><p>Delegates applauded as a Liberal Democrat from Liverpool city council took the stage to announce her decision to defect to Labour.</p><p>Lynnie Hinnigan, a community activist, youth worker and parent, said she was not crossing the floor as a career move at the Labour-run council, but because, as a Lib Dem, she \"cannot defend the indefensible\".</p><p>As a mother with aspirations for her children to go to university, she said she felt betrayed by Nick Clegg over tuition fees as well as cuts to services such as Sure Start centres.</p><p>\"I spend day in, day out, trying to raise the aspirations of young people, and the reason I am coming to Labour is because Labour cares,\" she said. \"Nick Clegg lied to me, he lied to the people of Liverpool, and it's wrong.\"</p>","headline":"Harriet Harman: this week has been a turning point for Labour","trailText":"Deputy leader says party has apologised for mistakes made during 13 years in government and it is 'time to move on'<br />","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2011/9/29/1317305020252/Harriet-Harman-at-the-Lab-003.jpg","wordcount":"1061","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"379683695","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5264923","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hélène Mulholland, political reporter","internalPageCode":"1640560","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-10-02T14:05:37Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/29/harriet-harman-turning-point-labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/sep/29/harriet-harman-turning-point-labour","tags":[{"id":"politics/labour-conference-2011","webTitle":"Labour conference 2011","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour-conference-2011","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour-conference-2011","references":[]},{"id":"politics/harrietharman","webTitle":"Harriet Harman","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/harrietharman","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labourconference","webTitle":"Labour conference","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labourconference","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenemulholland","webTitle":"Hélène Mulholland","rcsId":"GNL328716","r2ContributorId":"15716","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/10/19/helene_mulholland_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hélène Mulholland is political reporter at the Guardian.

The great feminist war.\" \"I stood there on the shore and let the waves crash over me one after another, watching them build, feeling them pull me close. Waiting for the break.\"</p><p>Actually, I don't have to imagine any such conversation: as ever, the reality is rather dull. My older daughters used to come home from school all grumpy about having to \"do\" feminism. For their homework they would want me to tick one of the multiple-choice boxes explaining my exact kind of feminism. Was I, they impatiently asked, a radical or socialist or separatist feminist? \"Don't be daft,\" I would say, but homework is&nbsp;homework.</p><p>Explaining that it was never like that just annoyed them. And I feel much the same when I&nbsp;read about the waves of feminism. We are on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women\" title=\"\">fourth wave</a> apparently. Grab a bodyboard! For of course, feminism contains multitudes (bickering multitudes, I concede) of thought, ideas and activism. Feminism is always a process, not a finished product: a system of ideas about gender equality that mutate and regenerate.</p><p>There are days when we can be optimistic: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism\" title=\"\">discussions around everyday sexism</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jun/19/caitlin-moran-feminism-interview\" title=\"\">Caitlin Moran's wisecracks</a> have turned her into a rock star worshipped by young girls; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/laurie-penny\" title=\"\">Laurie Penny</a>, a knowingly troublesome writer, has punched her way through the cybersphere, by turning anxiety into anger. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could\" title=\"\">Kimberlé Crenshaw</a> packs out lecture halls as she explains that \"intersectionality\" is not new, that we need to see race and class as intertwined and throws down the challenge to white feminists: who has the power to end debate, to walk away? That same challenge is there too from trans activists and sex workers and this is how feminism remakes itself. All of this is happening now, a consciousness raising, that seems rude and healthy and almost a movement. Almost.</p><p>Where can this energy go next? Both Moran's and Penny's revolution appears to involve dismantling neo-liberalism and an enormous amount of wanking. It's irresistible and it is bliss to be alive with such joy and rage flying round. To be middle-aged though is not very heaven, it is to have come down a bit.</p><p>For while I wait for the revolution, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/08/harriet-harman-gordon-brown-inequality-labour-sexism\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman tours the TV studios</a> explaining how even at the top of politics she has been dissed and dismissed for being a woman, not given the job she was elected to do (deputy PM) by Gordon Brown. Damian McBride, Brown's former adviser, tells us that the PM was not&nbsp;sexist.</p><p>Oh frabjous day! Men get to decide who is sexist or not! Harman is then also dismissed for narcissism and ambition – attributes that appear to be valued in male politicians – but her general points on the lack of women at the top in party politics remain salient.</p><p>How have we got to this? A feminism that is culturally buzzing and politicising young women but not in any way that includes the established institutions that are perceived to be broken and decrepit? But the false doctrine of austerity has meant that women, single mothers in particular, and public sector workers in general, have been at the frontline of this war. They have been demonised and subject to punitive cuts. Even though Iain Duncan Smith's plans for Universal Credit are in tatters, have wasted a fortune and are still not signed off, his fundamentalist ideology is still in play, for it is central to Conservatism.</p><p>Squaring this circle between vibrant, hopeful feminist thought and the traditional sphere of politics is ever more difficult. But the more that politics pulls away from culture as it is lived, the more it loses its mandate. Equally, cultural theorists cannot ignore the archaic institutions, as much as we may want to.</p><p>If we take some of the basic tenets of feminism to be about equal pay or reproductive rights, we see that enshrining these in law is still part of the battle. It is noble that the 1967 Abortion Act happened not because those who supported it thought it was a vote-winner, but because they felt they had a moral duty to stop women dying.</p><p>This is why I say that although opting out of the system is attractive, some of the energy of a new generation of feminism dissipates because it is not anchored to any political structure. Can this energy coagulate into a single political entity?</p><p>Could we have a feminist party?</p><p>Liberal feminism is always critiqued for being too conciliatory and always compromised. It certainly feels like that at Westminster.</p><p>But while the media continues to tell us that recession produces only rightwing parties, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/20/first-mep-feminist-party-likely-win-seat-european-elections\" title=\"\">Sweden a feminist party</a> has risen up precisely out of anger about racism, the wage gap and male violence. It has only one MEP, but she is virulently anti-reactionary and taking on Sweden's \"wronged white men\".</p><p>A feminist party flags up the failure of traditional parties to change. For this fourth wave of feminism crashes against something prosaic. There is talk of mutiny, insurrection, revolution and it is glorious. But we need to create some new mechanisms of change that sustain themselves. The idea that recession produces only Ukip types is just not true. The fourth wave is firing imaginations: mine anyway. I imagine a party where all are welcome, where sparks fly, where the shifts in culture are properly reflected. Bring as many plus-ones and bottles as you like. It's time for My Big Fat Feminist Party.</p>","headline":"Harriet Harman is right about sexism in politics – let's start a feminist party","trailText":"<p><strong>Suzanne Moore: </strong>The fourth

He was accusing her of sexual discrimination, sex worker discrimination and possibly of <a href=\"http://www.sockdreams.com/_shop/edit/index.php\">sexy socks</a> discrimination too, although on that last point I'm not clear. That's because by the time Harman's tormentor had got that far down his list I was yelling \"Shut the fuck up\" and \"Leave her alone, nutter\", and couldn't hear his yelling for my own. </p><p>It was the first time I'd felt protective towards Labour's deputy leader for some time. The episode was instructive in several ways. Who, after all, is the more vulnerable in this world, the prosperous and powerful Labour deputy leader or the young man who sells his body for a living? It is certainly the latter, for all his perturbing aggression on that day. Yet in those very particular circumstances Harman seemed momentarily shorn of the protection of high social status and the young sex worker became briefly just another angry male jabbing a finger in a defenceless female's face. </p><p>But, of course, Harman is far from defenceless. Once the tirade was over she rebutted the incensed sex-worker's charges, dealing with him as doughtily as she dealt with stand-up comedy worker William Hague in the Commons on Wednesday. I say doughtily rather than brilliantly.  For me, she won the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7923257.stm\">contest at the dispatch box</a> on points rather than by a knock out. Westminster specialists were split in their decisions: Harriet has that effect. </p><p>Even the Guardian's own couldn't agree. I think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2009/mar/04/harman-hague-pmqs\">Nick Watt</a> is right that when she stuck it to Hague over his past enthusiasm for de-regulation she was stirring. She made her opponent look juvenile. Having her glasses on helped. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/05/harriet-harman-prime-ministers-questions\">Simon Hoggart</a>, though, strikes me as half right in detecting a touch of primness: the quality that opens her up to \"posh lefty\" jibes. Elsewhere, the Indie's <a href=\"http://janemerrick.independentminds.livejournal.com/6511.html\">Jane Merrick</a> thought she edged it, while the Mail's Quentin Letts was predictably <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1159489/QUENTIN-LETTS-The-young-shaver-did-best-laugh.html\">malicious</a>: he gets a kick out of pulling girls' hair. And here, perhaps, we approach the heart of it. With Harriet, it's all about sex. </p><p>Now, settle down. I do not mean that I fancy her rotten or think her all decoration and no depth. I mean that the particular style of femininity she personifies has a way of exciting conflicting passions. To a certain sort of Tory type – sometimes women included – the combination of a top-end middle class upbringing and left-ish, feminist views triggers a deep and quite alarming loathing. Letts is a classic example. Even a certain gentleman blond <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/4929301/Mad-Hatties-raving-almost-made-me-think-of-siding-with-Sir-Fred.html\">succumbs</a> to a degree. It's as though in such circles it's not enough to disagree strongly with Harman. There is an urge to humiliate her too. For others, of course, she is a beacon of female achievement in a still bloke-centric world, a sister on the inside of patriarchy's citadel.</p><p>Me, I'm as divided within myself as are assessments of her generally. I've never met Harman, and so can't judge her as an individual. I will say, though, that affluent, liberal feminism (as opposed to the socialist variety I prefer) does tend to produce a certain kind of piety, one that sometimes forgets that a poor, ill-educated, life-damaged male is more disadvantaged than a poised, polished professional female. On Harman herself, I've felt at odds with her about gender politics and other sorts too. Sometimes, she just gets on my nerves. </p><p>Yet when she is targeted with a venom rarely deployed against male politicians guilty of things she's been accused of lately – high ambition, cunning, ineptitude – I instinctively taking her side. I don't know if it's \"progressive\" solidarity or old-fashioned gallantry, but whatever it is rebels against the nastiness and double-standards she inspires. And I can see that she is brave. Hague is the House wise guy, but she held her own. Is she prime minister material? A week ago I'd have said no immediately. Today, I'd have to give it a bit more thought.</p>","headline":"With Harriet, it's all about sex","trailText":"<p><strong>Dave Hill: </strong>Labour's deputy leader is targeted with a venom rarely deployed against male politicians</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/25zta","wordcount":"682","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"344208830","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dave Hill","internalPageCode":"1179289","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2009-03-10T11:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/05/harrietharman-women","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/05/harrietharman-women","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"politics/harrietharman","webTitle":"Harriet Harman","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/harrietharman","references":[]},{"id":"politics/women","webTitle":"Women in politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/women","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/women","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labourleadership","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davehill","webTitle":"Dave Hill","rcsId":"GNL064289","r2ContributorId":"21999","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/29/Dave_Hill.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dave Hill is a novelist, blogger, occasional broadcaster and long-standing writer for the Guardian.
