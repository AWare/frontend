President Rouhani's meeting w/WilliamJHague on the sidelines of UNGA has been confirmed,\" the tweet said.</p><p>\"We would be happy to meet,\" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said, \"but we have had nothing formal from Tehran about it.\"</p><p>Diplomats said that the tweet reflected the new Iranian government's eagerness to make diplomatic headway on the nuclear issue, which has been at an impasse for several years. A Hague meeting with either Rouhani or Zarif could clear the way to restoring full diplomatic ties, which have not existed since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011.</p><p>In a television interview aired on Sunday, Obama made clear that there was a diplomatic opening with Iran, not only over the nuclear question but also over Syria. He confirmed earlier reports that he and Rouhani had \"reached out\" to each other, exchanging letters.</p><p>US officials were sceptical about a Rouhani meeting, but some observers said the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons has opened new space for global diplomacy.</p><p>Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and an expert on US-Iran diplomacy, said \"I think there is a chance [of a meeting]. It would be a strong political push for movement. If Obama got involved, it would be the infusion of political will needed to reach an agreement.</p><p>\"Tehran is already claiming some of the credit for the Syria deal. Rouhani needs to show that through his diplomatic efforts he has already avoided a war. He is desperate in his first six months to show his approach has paid more dividends than the hardline approach of his predecessor.\"</p><p>Parsi added that if Obama was to meet Rouhani it was likely to be an orchestrated encounter in a corridor, rather than a sit-down talk, \"to give both sides deniability\". The last encounter between an American and Iranian leader was when Jimmy Carter met the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1977.</p><p>Speaking on ABC's This Week, Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region\". He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict\".</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged Iran's leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests. That a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilising,\" Obama said in the ABC interview, which was recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p><p>\"My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn't draw a lesson that [because] we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran,\" Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p><p>After meeting John Kerry, US secretary of state, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point. \"The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron – Iran,\" Netanyahu said. \"Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,\" he added.</p><p>However, Obama insisted: \"What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically. You know, negotiations with the Iranians are always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that … if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can strike a deal.\"</p>","headline":"Iran's Rouhani may meet Obama at UN after American president reaches out","trailText":"<p>First meeting of US and Iranian leaders since 1979 revolution could open way to diplomatic end to Iranian nuclear standoff</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/15/1379275543400/Irans-President-Hassan-Ro-005.jpg","wordcount":"864","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"417344382","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8077790","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, Diplomatic editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1965793","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-18T20:06:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","description":"The latest news and comment on Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

But there has been growing speculation over a potential encounter between the two leaders on the margins of Tuesday's meeting at UN headquarters in New York, which would be a carefully choreographed but potent sign of improving relations between the two countries. </p><p>\"The fact of the matter is we don't have a meeting scheduled with President Rouhani, but we're always open to diplomacy if we believe it can advance our objectives, and in this instance our objective is an Iran that meets its international obligations,\" said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser at the White House.</p><p>Rhodes said Obama had indicated since 2007 that he was willing to have bilateral meetings with Iran without preconditions if there is was an opportunity for progress. Rhodes also said other western powers would be closely involved in any talks. \"The issues between the United States and Iran are not ones that would be settled with one discussion,\" he added.</p><p>Western diplomats believe the new Iranian administration is playing a high-risk strategy that could face resistance from hardline elements in Tehran opposed to nuclear talks, particularly if Rouhani returns from New York with nothing to show in terms of progress. But they perceive a rare window of opportunity – and one that will not be open indefinitely.<br /> <br />One diplomatic source said the newly-empowered pragmatist wing in Iran had displayed \"some pretty fancy footwork\" in recent weeks in preparing the groundwork for the UN meeting, but Rouhani's delegation needed to convince western powers that it was serious about giving ground on nuclear enrichment, in return for an easing of sanctions. </p><p>Obama will give a welcome address at the UN on Tuesday, a few hours before Rouhani is scheduled to address the assembly, a symbolically important though coincidental confluence of scheduling that will highlight building hopes of a breakthrough in relations between the two powers. Asked on Thursday if the two leaders would meet, a White House spokesman replied: \"We will see. It has always been possible.\"</p><p>Obama plans to meet formally with his counterparts from Nigeria and Lebanon in New York, and has also scheduled a meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. The meeting will occur just days before Obama hosts the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at the White House.</p><p>Obama's address will, according to Rhodes, focus on recent events in the north Africa and Middle East, touching on the final status negotiations between Israel and Palestine. He said it will also include a section on Iran's nuclear programme and US \"openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution\". </p><p>Rhodes told a conference call with reporters that the US administration still believed there was time for a diplomatic solution to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, despite suggestions from Israel that time had run out for any negotiated solution. Israel dismissed Rouhani's attempts at dialogue on Friday, saying the Iranian leader was engaged in \"media spin\". Yuval Steinitz, Israel's minister for strategic affairs, said the Iranians were six months away from developing a bomb, and that \"there is no more time to hold negotiations\".  </p><p>Signs of a changing attitude under Iran's new leader have been coming thick and fast. On Friday, Rouhani called for \"constructive interaction with the world\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/19/iranian-president-hassan-rouhanis-washington-post-op-ed-annotated/\">in an opinion article published by the Washington Post</a>. In language that contrasted starkly with that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he wrote: \"Gone is the age of blood feuds … A constructive approach to diplomacy … means engaging with one's counterparts.\"</p><p>Rouhani went on to say that the old \"Cold War mentality leads to everyone's losses\", and expressed a desire to move \"beyond impasses, whether in relation to Syria, my country's nuclear program or its relations with the United States\".</p><p>The recent, more conciliatory tone from Tehran is being seen in Washington as the best hope of an end to the hostile stand-off with the Islamic Republic which has existed since Obama came to office in 2009, when he promised to try to put the two country's relations on a new footing. Were Obama and Rouhani to meet in New York next week, it would be the first face-to-face interaction between the countries' presidents since the Iranian revolution of 1979.</p><p>The driving force for the apparent glasnost in approach in Tehran appears to be the ongoing international sanctions that are extracting a heavy price on the Iranian economy. Geneive Abdo, a former Guardian Tehran correspondent who is now an Iran expert at the non-partisan think tank the Stimson Center, said the sanctions \"have never been this deep or broad. Oil exports are plummeting and Iran can no longer participate in the international banking system, which prevents it selling goods for hard currency\".</p><p>Abdo said there are indications the regime fears that prolonged economic hardship could instigate another round of popular protests such as the \"green\" unrest of 2009, which was harshly crushed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417896133'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/7/30/1343664528530/Ayatollah-Khamenei-008.jpg' alt='Ayatollah Khamenei' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ayatollah Khamenei is Iran's supreme leader. Photo: Ay-Collection/Sipa/Rex Feature</figcaption></figure><p>Judging from past experience, the key to whether Rouhani can effect real change will be the support, or lack of it, of the true power in the land, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. There too, signs are so far promising. On Tuesday Khamenei used the expression \"heroic leniency\", which is being interpreted as a euphemism for a softer stance on foreign policy. The following day, 11 political prisoners were freed from jail.</p><p>Apart from Rouhani's appearance at the UN on Tuesday, he will be speaking in New York at an event co-hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society on Thursday. He will also make appearances on CNN and on Charlie Rose's interview show on PBS.</p><p>Obama has promised to test the new apparent openness to dialogue in Tehran. But administration officials are at the same time making clear that there will be no lifting of sanctions without real movement from the Iranian regime.</p><p>In particular, Iran will have to accept stringent controls on its disputed nuclear programme, which the US and its allies see as a path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Negotiations on nuclear enrichment may prove to be the most difficult shift to get past Iran's hardliners and Rouhani is treading carefully: in his Washington Post article, he repeated the conventional argument that for Iran, developing a \"peaceful nuclear energy program\" is \"about who Iranians are as a nation\".</p>","headline":"White House indicates Obama could meet Iran president

It was announced by Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, after her own first meeting with Zarif on the eve of the UN general assembly in New York.</p><p>\"What I saw today is energy and determination to move forward on our talks and many things flow from that,\" said Ashton, who acts as a convenor for the six-nation group that leads nuclear negotiations with Iran. She also said diplomats and experts from the negotiating group would meet then with an Iranian team next month in Geneva to talk about the details of a possible nuclear compromise.</p><p>The last round of nuclear talks with Iran took place in Kazakhstan in April, but the negotiations have been stalled for eight years. Iran refuses to agree to UN security council demands for it to suspend the enrichment of uranium until it has convinced the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency that it does not have a covert nuclear weapons programme, and has provided details of earlier weapons development work. Iran insists its programme is peaceful and within its international rights, and it demands that the punitive western sanctions be lifted.</p><p>Since the election of a new pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, in June, Tehran has signalled that Iran might be ready for a compromise on the nuclear issue and Zarif, a American-educated former ambassador to the UN, is conducting an intense diplomatic offensive at the UN, arriving five days before the general assembly and meeting a large number of foreign ministers.</p><p>A meeting with Kerry had not been confirmed, however, until now. Rouhani arrives tonight and will address the general assembly tomorrow in what Iranian diplomats claim will be a concrete and detailed manifesto for a new chapter in the relations between Iran and the rest of the world. Both capitals have said a meeting between Rouhani and Barack Obama is possible if it looks like there might be a diplomatic opportunity to be seized.</p><p>Zarif will meet Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, at the UN this afternoon, when they are expected to discuss the nuclear issue and bilateral relations, beginning a process potentially leading to the restoration of full diplomatic ties since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in 2011.</p><p>In 2001, the US secretary of state at the time, Colin Powell, shook hands with his Iranian opposite number at the general assembly, but a Kerry-Zarif meeting would be the first talks at ministerial level since the Iranian revolution.</p>","headline":"Iran's foreign minister expected to meet Kerry in diplomatic

This could include talks over Iran's controversial nuclear programme and the Syrian conflict. The Iranian president is keen to show the world that he has a united country behind him.</p><p>Khamenei, long a fierce critic of the US, has thrown his weight behind Rouhani, apparently giving his blessing for direct talks between Rouhani and President Barack Obama, which could take place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week. And Iran's opposition activists and politicians, given new heart after Rouhani's victory in June, appear to share support for the new president in his attempt to improve relations with the west.</p><p>Saturday's headlines in Tehran reflected the mood of growing optimism in Iran, where even the hardline press such as <em>Keyhan</em>, an ultra-conservative newspaper whose director is directly appointed by Khamenei, appears to be welcoming the possibility of a historic meeting that can put an end to Tehran and Washington's three decades of animosity. \"I have no plans, but it's possible,\" was <em>Keyhan</em>'s headline, quoting Rouhani on the possibility of a meeting with Obama. In a further sign that Rouhani has full authority, the Revolutionary Guard issued a statement offering support for his administration.</p><p>Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the former vice-president of Iran under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami, told the <em>Observer</em> that he saw Rouhani's trip as \"the most important visit\" to the UN by an Iranian president in \"the most exceptional circumstances\". \"On one hand, Rouhani has the support of the supreme leader, on the other, the US has to come to terms with its mistakes in dealing with Iran in the past,\" he said. By mentioning mistakes, Abtahi was referring particularly to the time, under Khatami, when President George Bush labelled Iran as part of \"an axis of evil\" along with North Korea and Iraq, despite Khatami's reformist administration.</p><p>Rouhani's visit contrasts with those made by his predecessors, Abtahi said, because \"conservatives are not sabotaging and not expressing opposing views\".</p><p>Zahra Eshraghi, a reformist politician and a granddaughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the 1979 Islamic revolution, echoed Abtahi, saying that conservatives have come to the realisation that Iran needs constructive relations with the international community. \"Given our experience with sanctions recently, especially our difficulties with importing medicines, hardliners have also come to terms with the need for dialogue with the United States,\" she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p><p>\"The events in the region in the past two years [a reference to Syria] shows that Iran remains as a regional power and the US, too, needs to have dialogue with Iran\" she added. \"The time has come for the two countries to put aside the mutual distrust and act on their national interests.\"</p><p>On Monday morning in New York, the stage management and hype gives way to bargaining, as Mohammad Javad Zarif sits down for the first time as Iran's foreign minister with Lady (Catherine) Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief to gauge how far Iran has really come in from the cold. Zarif is to meet William Hague, the British foreign secretary, as well, and may have a staged brief encounter with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, in some UN corridor during the week-long general assembly. Whatever happens, the atmosphere will almost certainly be an improvement on what has gone before.</p><p>Zarif's predecessor as Iran's delegate, Saeed Jalili, was a dry bureaucrat inclined to read out convoluted didacticpresentations, apparently scared to stray from the script written in Tehran. Any hint of ambiguity or spontaneity sprouted long delays while he phoned for instructions.</p><p></p><p>Zarif could not be more different; he is a skilled diplomat and is fluent in English. Moreover, everything that Zarif and Rouhani have said suggests that he, unlike Jalili, has full authority to negotiate, while Rouhani will paint the bigger picture at the general assembly of an Iranian republic trying to break free of its pariah status.</p><p>The question now is how these experienced diplomats play their hand. At the lower end of expectations, the Iranians will spread bonhomie and make a date for serious nuclear negotiations in the coming weeks, involving the cumbersome format of the past few years that has kept the international community more or less on the same page, but with little real progress. That format puts diplomats from six powers – US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – on one side of the negotiating table with Ashton, acting as their convenor. Iran sits opposite them, wary and combative.</p><p>However, there is some reason to believe that the main players will aim for something more imaginative. Rouhani and Obama are both in a hurry to score a success. Rouhani is at the start of a honeymoon period in Tehran that will be measured in months, not years. Obama, at the other end of his presidency, faces a slide into lame duck status.</p><p>Both men know, as do all the other players in this tortuous game, that if there is to be a deal it will ultimately be hammered out between Washington and Tehran with the other five nations acting as facilitators. If they sense an opening, they could cut out the middle men – and woman – and head straight to bilateral talks. If that is in the air, expect to see an historic handshake this week – which would be the first between a US president and a leader from the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><p>However, there will be bumps along the way. Informal bilateral contacts could proceed in tandem with the multilateral negotiations, if only to keep Russia and China engaged. Or the multilateral track might give way at some point to a bilateral endgame. Whichever route is taken, it is a negotiation in which everyone at the table has a fairly clear and widely shared vision, of the outcome: an Iran empowered to continue its nuclear programme but under internationally dictated limits.</p><p>The country would be allowed to enrich uranium without the burden of sanctions, but only up to a maximum of 5% purity – enough to make reactor fuel, not weapons. The world's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), would have a stronger inspection mandate, allowing it to examine not just the facilities Iran declares it has but also sites it suspects could be harbouring secret weapons work. Iran would also have to give up its stock of 20% uranium, currently the main proliferation concern because of the ease with which it could be further spun into weapons-grade fissile material.</p><p>There could also be some understanding on what happens at Arak, where a heavy water reactor is under construction that could produce plutonium, another possible fuel for a bomb. But that might be left for another day. Slow progress at the site has meant it will not be opening early next year as planned, giving the negotiators some breathing space.</p><p>Even if the parties to the talks have a shared sense of where they are going, getting there will be complicated. Rouhani will want sanctions relief up front so that he can return to Tehran in triumph and widen his own political window of opportunity. If not, the loose leash that Khamenei has allowed the president could be yanked back. Khamenei is making the right noises, but there is still no certainty he has made the strategic decision to bottle up the nuclear programme.</p>","headline":"Hardliners hold back as Iran waits for Rouhani and Obama to make history","trailText":"Landmark meeting between US president and his Iranian counterpart could allow for direct talks on nuclear programme","newspaperPageNumber":"23","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/21/1379791460096/President-Elect-Hassan-Ro-003.jpg","wordcount":"1283","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417925160","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8103705","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Julian Borger","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-22T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1969135","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-24T19:25:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/21/hassan-rouhani-barack-obama-iran-us-meeting","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/21/hassan-rouhani-barack-obama-iran-us-meeting","tags":[{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","description":"The latest news and comment on Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"profile/saeedkamalidehghan","webTitle":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan","r2ContributorId":"27142","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/29/1359471686287/Saeed-Kamali-Dehghan_2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Saeed Kamali Dehghan is a staff journalist with the Guardian.

Ashton is a relatively untested EU official who will, if the talks take place, face experienced Iranian nuclear negotiators. Yet the record shows that in recent months the EU's top diplomat has emerged as a sharp critic of Iran's nuclear policy. The talks hence offer an opportunity for Lady Ashton to silence the political foes who claim she does not have the bona fides to represent the EU to the world.</p><p>Granted, Ashton began her tenure as head of EU foreign policy offering only vague statements on the Iranian nuclear issue. During a European parliamentary hearing in January she said that she was \"in close contact with all the relevant actors, including the [<a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Iran_Nuclear_Proposals\" title=\"Arms Control Association: History of Official Proposals on the Iranian Nuclear Issue\">P-5+1</a>]\" (that is, UN security council members France, Britain, the United States, China, Russia, plus Germany) and that she remained committed to the \"twin-track\" approach regarding Iran. Visiting US secretary of state Hilary Clinton in Washington later that month, Ashton announced that the EU supported US and P-5+1 efforts, and that she stood ready to \"consider what else\" needed to be done. Ashton did not specify what path she intended to follow if the status quo over Iran's nuclear issue remained.</p><p>Since leaving the US, however, she has adopted a different tone. At the Munich security conference, which was attended by Iranian foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/04/iran.world\" title=\"Guardian: A Middle East free of WMD\">Manouchehr Mottaki</a>, Ashton asked that Tehran be more transparent and responsive to the <a href=\"http://www.iaea.org/\" title=\"International Atomic Energy Agency website\">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> and she charged that Iran had not adequately responded to the engagement efforts by Barack Obama. She also criticised Iran for continuing clandestine work on its nuclear program outside its safeguard obligations during Javier Solana's time at the helm of EU foreign policy. Ashton can hardly be accused of timidity, given the foreign minister's presence at the conference.</p><p>The following day, 7 February, Ashton went on the attack again as Iran announced that the country would <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/09/iran-enrichment-higher-grade-uranium\" title=\"Guardian: Iran begins enriching higher-grade uranium, says state TV\">enrich uranium up to 20%</a>. Ashton bluntly stated that the Iranian declaration \"add[s] to the deficit of confidence in the nature of Iran's nuclear programme. This has already been aggravated by Iran's unwillingness to engage in meaningful talks.\"</p><p>Ashton then took her condemnation of Iran's nuclear activities on the road, broadcasting her criticisms in the Middle East. In Cairo, during remarks to the Arab League, Ashton said that the EU \"remain[s] deeply concerned about … Iranian unwillingness to engage in serious talks on the nuclear question,\" noting that a nuclear Iran may set off a ripple effect in the region. \"Our position is based on the firm belief that an Iran with nuclear weapons risks triggering a proliferation cascade throughout the Middle East. This is the last thing that this region needs. A nuclear weapons-free Middle East remains a European goal.\"</p><p>Next, Ashton took to the global stage to get her points across. At the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/03/iran-ahmadinejad-us-nuclear-threats\" title=\"Guardian: US shows its nuclear hand in bid to show sincerity on arms\">Nuclear Proliferation treaty review</a> conference last week she honed in on Iran and criticised the country for continuing to violate international obligations and for defying both the UN security council and the IAEA, \"despite repeated and ambitious offers by the international community to discuss these issues, [and] pursue comprehensive and fair negotiations and work for a diplomatic solution\". Today, notwithstanding agreeing to talks with Tehran, Ashton continues to emphasise that she supports further sanctions against that country.</p><p>Compared to Javier Solana, a physicist by training, who led talks with the Iranians for several years and was the former Spanish foreign minister and secretary-general of Nato, Ashton is still a nuclear lightweight.

Both leaders are expected to elaborate on expressions in the last weeks of mutual respect and a desire to interface. Rouhani is not two months in office and is the center of a great deal of optimism. Furthermore, according to former Iranian president <strong>Mohammad Khatami</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/iran-west-not-turn-back-diplomacy\">writing in the Guardian </a>on Monday, Rouhani has the power to negotiate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Explicit public support&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/sep/21/iran-heroic-flexibility-diplomacy-martyrdom\">from the supreme leader</a>&nbsp;of the Islamic republic provides Rouhani and his colleagues with the necessary authority for a diplomatic resolution of a number of foreign policy issues with the west, not just the nuclear issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU foreign policy chief, <strong>Catherine Ashton</strong>, met with Iranian foreign minister<strong>&nbsp;Mohammad Javad&nbsp;Zarif</strong> in New York Monday. She said Zarif would meet with US secretary of state John Kerry on Thursday, in what would be the first ministerial talks between Tehran and Washington since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p> <p>Seasoned observers on all sides, and not just Israel, are counseling caution as a potential new phase of international conversation begins. The leaders of both Iran and Syria have projects they would like more time to complete &ndash; time that could be created by ultimately fruitless talk. But the assumption is the talks in New York this week don't have to be fruitless and might yield a breakthrough.</p> <p>Headlines may also be provided by an early speech by the Brazilian president&nbsp;Dilma Rousseff. She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/brazil-president-snub-us-nsa\">cancelled a state visit to the US</a> in protest at revelations that the National Security Agency had been spying on her personal communications and those of her aides.

Its sprawling walled compound on Ferdowsi Avenue, in central Tehran, is typical of the grand mansions foreigners built when Victorian Britain was vying with tsarist Russia for influence in the dying days of the Qajar dynasty.</p><p>In 1943, the UK residency building  was the venue for the Tehran conference, when Churchill met Stalin and Roosevelt to plan the final stages of the war against nazism. British ambassadors enjoy showing guests the drawing room where the Big Three met. It is rare pleasure in an often thankless posting, where perennial tensions mean that access to the Iranian government is limited and the atmosphere invariably hostile. Dominick Chilcott, the current envoy, has only been in Tehran for a few weeks and already faces expulsion.</p><p>It was easier in the 1960s and 1970s, when Britain backed the shah as the pliable \"policeman\" of the Gulf, a counterweight to Soviet influence in the Middle East, and treated Iran as a lucrative export market, especially for weapons.</p><p>But British ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons famously got it wrong, reporting that the shah's position was secure as late as 1978.</p><p>Relations have been poor since the 1979 revolution, when the UK was accused, sometimes simultaneously, of supporting the shah and fomenting the Islamic revolution that overthrew him. Older Iranians still joke that the words 'made in England'  can be found under every mullah's beard.</p><p>It was at that time that the road known as Winston Churchill Avenue was renamed Bobby Sands Avenue, to honour the IRA's prison hunger-striker – two fingers to British imperialism. The mood did not improve in 1980 when Iran's London embassy was taken over by Iraqi-backed gunmen before the siege was dramatically ended by the SAS hostage rescue.</p><p>But hostility goes back much further in a relationship which Iranians sometimes admit has an obsessive quality. Uncle Napoleon, a highly popular book and film, satirises the view that the English are behind all significant events in Iran. It was in that spirit that Khomeini's supporters dubbed Britain the Little Satan (the US is the Great Satan), partly in reference to its role in the 1951 overthrow of Muhammad Mossadegh, the elected nationalist prime minister who dared to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</p><p>In recent years the main business of the British embassy has been conducted from a drab modern office block by the gate.</p><p>In 1987, when Britain was accused of backing Iraq in its bloody war with Iran, the embassy suffered one of its worst assaults: Edward Chaplin, the chargé d'affaires, was abducted and beaten by revolutionary guardsmen. Chaplin was quickly released. But within a few months he and all other UK staff were withdrawn.</p><p>And just after they returned, in 1989, Khomeini issued his fatwa against Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses. It took another decade and some deft diplomacy before relations were back to anything approaching normal.</p><p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory in 2005 spelled an end to hopes for liberalisation at home. But his second presidential term, after the disputed polls in 2009, marked a new nadir. Iran's leaders attacked the US, Israel and the UN. But Britain was singled out.</p><p>\"The diplomats who have talked to us with courtesy up to now have in the past few days taken the masks away from their faces and are showing their true image,\" said the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"And the most evil of them is the British government.\"</p><p>It has been downhill ever since. The BBC's Persian-language TV service, launched in 2009, is seen in Tehran as a government channel. The UK's active role on the nuclear issue keeps it in the forefront of the regime's hostility. Last week's announcement that Britain had frozen $1.6bn of Iranian assets was the immediate trigger for the embassy attack.</p><p>Calculated or not, Tuesday's incident may reflect nervousness in Tehran. Iran claims to support the movements for democracy in the Arab world. But that sits ill with the brutal suppression of its own green movement protests.</p><p>Iran is influential in Iraq, but elsewhere in the region it is on the defensive. The uprising in Syria stands to rob it of its strategic ally in the Arab world and weaken its link with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Assaulting a western embassy – even one representing the Little Satan – will not change that.</p>","headline":"British embassy attack in Tehran follows history of bad blood and protest","trailText":"Anglo-Iranian relations have been poor since the 1979 revolution and the regime's distrust of Britain is only second to US","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/29/1322599320437/British-embassy-attack-in-003.jpg","wordcount":"786","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"382566105","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5523957","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Black, Middle East editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1669561","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-12-02T20:43:45Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/british-embassy-attack-tehran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/29/british-embassy-attack-tehran","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/foreignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/foreignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ianblack","webTitle":"Ian Black","rcsId":"GNL014381","r2ContributorId":"15738","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/ian_black_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian Black is the Guardian's Middle East editor.

That might appear insignificant, but was of huge global political importance,\" Ebtekar wrote after Rouhani's return to Tehran from  New York.</p><p>\"This development on both sides succeeded despite strong pressure from hardliners and those looking backward instead of forward within the political context of their respective nations.\"</p><p>Rouhani has been broadly praised at home for his UN visit while hawkish hardliners have largely held back from criticism because the president is assumed to have the backing of Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, for the overture with the US.</p><p>Iran's conservative-dominated parliament also endorsed the president's visit, local agencies said on Wednesday, reporting that the speaker, Ali Larijani, had praised the president on the visit.</p><p>Ebtekar, who is the head of Iran's environmental protection organisation, said the standoff between Tehran and the west over Iran's nuclear programme and the Syrian conflict are two contemporary challenges that need to be addressed urgently. But she warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/02/iran-rouhani-obama-detente-ometer-interactive\" title=\"\">Tehran-Washington rapprochement</a>, which has increased hopes for a breakthrough, would not bear fruit unless the US showed consistency in its words and actions.</p><p>\"President Obama also indicated that the US does not seek regime change in Tehran and that the two countries can have a different, more open relationship after the dispute is settled,\" she writes. \"While the US seems ready to reciprocate, many observers question whether all the elements of the US administration are pulling in the same direction and whether there will be practical confidence-building measures in the near future to consolidate the fruits of this visit.\"</p><p>Ebtekar's warning comes after Obama reassured Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that the military option against Tehran has not been taken off the table.</p><p>There is also scepticism whether Obama can  reciprocate any Iranian compromise in the face of fierce resistance from  Congress. Following Obama's conversation with Netanyahu earlier this week, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted on Tuesday that the US needed a consistent policy with Iran. \"President Obama needs consistency to promote mutual confidence. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/384868220588408832\" title=\"\">Flip flop destroys trust and undermines US credibility</a>,\" he said.</p><p>In her article, Ebtekar recalls previous missed opportunities to improve US-Iran relations under the reformist administration of Mohammad Khatami between 1997 to 2005. She urged the west to seize  the opportunity created by Rouhani, whom she said has unrestricted mandate to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities.</p><p>\"In 1998, when President Khatami came to the UN with the novel approach of dialogue among civilisations, he faced an unrelenting storm of internal pressure while the US president branded Iran a member of the axis of evil, thus neutralising his excellent initiative at both the domestic and global levels,\" she recalls. \"With the passage of 15 years and the loss of millions of lives in global wars, perhaps we have all learned our lesson and global leaders are more prepared to say no to militarism, terrorism, nuclear arsenals and extremism.\"</p><p>Ebtekar, 53, spent at least six years of her childhood in the US  but later became involved in Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.Because of her English-language skills, she became a spokeswoman for the students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. At the time she was nicknamed Mary. She later sided with the reformists and under Khatami was appointed  the Islamic republic's first female vice-president.</p><p>Ebtekar was marginalised under Ahmadinejad and  came under fire in the aftermath of the disputed 2009 election when she visited  victims of the popular uprising.</p><p>In her article, Ebtekar says Rouhani's election has  raised hopes for an internal opening towards political prisoners, many of whom were arrested in 2009.</p><p>\"There has been gradual release of political prisoners who were detained on grounds of opposition to the results of the controversial elections of 2009,\" she writes. \"This demonstrates a unified and genuine effort on behalf of Iran to change the political atmosphere while adhering to the basic precepts and principles of the Islamic Republic and the inalienable right of Iran to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.\"</p><p>Prior to Rouhani's visit to New York, local agencies said Khamenei had declared amnesty for  80 political prisoners, boosting the president's credibility but activists have been so far unable to fully identify them.</p><p>Despite Ebtekar's comments, there is confusion in Tehran whether Rouhani's decision to speak to Obama was made with or without Khamenei's knowledge. This was reinforced when the commander of the elite revolutionary guards, the shock troopers of Iranian power, said earlier in the week that he approved the president's manoeuvres in New York but considered his conversation with Obama premature. Conservative media, including the Kayhan newspaper, have also shown dissatisfaction with the phone call.</p>","headline":"Obama and Rouhani's telephone call of huge  significance, says Iranian deputy","trailText":"<p>Masoumeh Ebtekar says first presidential phone conversation between US and Iran since 1979  is setback for hardliners</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380728830882/Barack-Obama-on-phone-003.jpg","wordcount":"854","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"418871001","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8144480","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan","internalPageCode":"1974544","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-05T16:07:26Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/obama-rouhani-phone-call-us-iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/02/obama-rouhani-phone-call-us-iran","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","description":"The latest news and comment on Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/nuclear-weapons","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nuclear-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/saeedkamalidehghan","webTitle":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan","r2ContributorId":"27142","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/29/1359471686287/Saeed-Kamali-Dehghan_2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Saeed Kamali Dehghan is a staff journalist with the Guardian.

On Friday, Rouhani, who was elected president as a moderate candidate in June and took up the post last month, called for \"constructive interaction with the world\" in an opinion article <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/president-of-iran-hassan-rouhani-time-to-engage/2013/09/19/4d2da564-213e-11e3-966c-9c4293c47ebe_story.html\">published by the Washington Post</a>.</p><p>In language that starkly contrasted with his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he wrote: \"Gone is the age of blood feuds ... A constructive approach to diplomacy ... means engaging with one's counterparts.\"</p><p>Rouhani went on to say that the old \"Cold War mentality leads to everyone's losses\", and expressed a desire to move \"beyond impasses, whether in relation to Syria, my country's nuclear program or its relations with the United States\".</p><p>The recent, more conciliatory tone from Tehran is being seen in Washington as the best hope of an end to the hostile stand-off with the Islamic Republic since Obama came to office in 2009, when he promised to try and put the two country's relations on a new footing. Were Obama and Rouhani to meet in New York next week, it would be the first face-to-face interaction between the countries' presidents since the Iranian revolution of 1979. </p><p>The driving force for the apparent glasnost in approach in Tehran appears to be the on-going international sanctions that are extracting a heavy price on the Iranian economy. Geneive Abdo, a former Guardian Tehran correspondent who is now an Iran expert at the non-partisan think tank the Stimson Center, said the sanctions \"have never been this deep or broad. Oil exports are plummeting and Iran can no longer participate in the international banking system which prevents it selling goods for hard currency.\"</p><p>Abdo said there are indications the regime fears that prolonged economic hardship could instigate another round of popular protests such as the \"green\" unrest of 2009 which was then harshly crushed.</p><p>Judging from past experience, the key to whether Rouhani can effect real change will be the support, or lack of it, of the true power in the land, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei. There too, signs are so far promising.</p><p>On Tuesday Khamenei used the expression \"heroic leniency\" that is being interpreted as a euphemism for a softer stance on foreign policy. The following day, 11 political prisoners were freed from jail.</p><p>Apart from Rouhani's appearance at the UN on Tuesday, there will be other opportunities to read the mood music in New York next week. On Thursday he will be speaking in the city at an event co-hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society, and he will also make appearances on CNN and on Charlie Rose's interview show on PBS.</p><p>Obama has promised to test out the new apparent openness to dialogue in Tehran. But administration officials are at the same time making clear that there will be no lifting of sanctions without real movement from the regime.</p><p>In particular, Iran will have to accept stringent controls on its disputed nuclear programme, which the US and its allies see as a path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Negotiations on nuclear enrichment may prove to be the most difficult shift to get past Iran's hardliners and Rouhani is treading carefully: in his Washington Post article, he repeated the conventional argument that for Iran, developing a \"peaceful nuclear energy program\" is \"about who Iranians are as a nation\".</p>","headline":"Obama could meet Iran's Rouhani at UN amid signs of thawing relations","trailText":"<p>Signs of Iran's changing attitude have come thick and fast in recent days but US officials have made clear there will be no lifting of sanctions without real movement from the regime</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/20/1379698311195/Obama--Rouhani-003.jpg","wordcount":"665","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417882494","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ed Pilkington in New York","internalPageCode":"1968905","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-23T17:44:48Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/20/obama-iran-hassan-rouhani-meeting-un","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/20/obama-iran-hassan-rouhani-meeting-un","tags":[{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"profile/edpilkington","webTitle":"Ed Pilkington","rcsId":"GNL038863","r2ContributorId":"15609","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/3/27/1332862968426/edpilkington_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ed Pilkington is the chief reporter for Guardian US.

But he said new action now from US lawmakers could shatter an international coalition made up of countries with interests as divergent as France, Russia and China, endangering prospects for a peaceful end to the decade-long nuclear standoff with the Islamic republic.</p><p>The countries worry that Tehran is trying to assemble an atomic weapons arsenal. Iran insists its programme is solely for peaceful energy production and medical research.</p><p>\"We put these sanctions in place in order to be able to put us in the strongest position possible to be able to negotiate. We now are negotiating,\" Kerry told reporters ahead of testifying before the Senate banking committee. \"And the risk is that if Congress were to unilaterally move to raise sanctions, it could break faith in those negotiations, and actually stop them and break them apart.\"</p><p>With nuclear negotiations set to resume in Switzerland next week, the Obama administration dispatched Kerry and the vice-president, Joe Biden, to Congress on Wednesday to seek more time for diplomacy. They faced scepticism from members of Congress determined to further squeeze the Iranian economy and wary of yielding any ground to Iran in the talks.</p><p>Kerry said the negotiators should have a few weeks more to see if they can reach an agreement.</p><p>\"The Iranian regime hasn't paused its nuclear programme,\" said Ed Royce, a Republican and House foreign affairs committee chairman.</p><p>\"Why should we pause our sanctions efforts as the administration is pressuring Congress to do?\"</p><p>Kerry said the potential accord with Iran relates to a \"tough proposal,\" adding: \"If it weren't strong, why wouldn't Iran have accepted it yet?\"</p><p>Kerry said, \"What we are asking everyone to do is calm down, look hard at what can be achieved and what the realities are. If this doesn't work, we reserve the right to dial back the sanctions. I will be up here on the Hill asking for increased sanctions, and we always reserve the military option. So we lose absolutely nothing, except for getting in the way of diplomacy and letting it work.\"</p><p>\"We ought to be actually ratcheting up the sanctions against Iran,\" Republican Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell.</p><p>\"What the administration was promoting is something the Israelis think is a bad deal for them. It's pretty clear the Sunni Arab allies of ours also think it's a bad deal. Looking at it strictly from an American point of view, I think it's a bad deal as well.\"</p><p>Last week's talks broke down as Iran demanded formal recognition of what it calls its right to enrich uranium, and as France sought stricter limits on Iran's ability to make nuclear fuel and on its heavy water reactor to produce plutonium, diplomats said.</p><p>Barack Obama spoke on Wednesday with the French president, François Hollande. The two countries are in full agreement on Iran, the White House said in a statement.</p><p>Obama is under pressure at home and abroad to resolve the Iran nuclear standoff, having said the US has until some time next year before the Islamic republic could reach nuclear weapons capacity.</p><p>Obama has reached out in an unprecedented manner to Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, with the two men holding the first direct conversation between US and Iranian leaders in more than three decades.</p><p>At the same time, Obama has angered US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, which see an Iranian nuclear arsenal as existential threats.</p><p>The new sanctions were overwhelmingly approved by the Republican-led House in July. The legislation blacklisted Iran's mining and construction sectors and committed the US to the goal of eliminating all Iranian oil exports worldwide by 2015. If the Senate banking committee pushes off its parallel bill any longer, lawmakers could attach it to a Senate defence bill, which could come up for debate as early as Thursday.</p>","headline":"Iran negotiations: John Kerry warns US Congress against passing new sanctions","trailText":"<p>US secretary of state says new sanctions could endanger prospects for peaceful end to nuclear standoff with Tehran</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/14/1384417408229/John-Kerry-004.jpg","wordcount":"681","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"422454266","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8320550","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press in Washington DC","internalPageCode":"1997168","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-11-17T08:24:05Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/14/iran-negotiations-john-kerry-sanctions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/14/iran-negotiations-john-kerry-sanctions","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/john-kerry","webTitle":"John Kerry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/john-kerry","references":[]},{"id":"world/congress","webTitle":"US Congress","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congress","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/congress","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","description":"The latest news and comment on Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/nuclear-weapons","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nuclear-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-422481754","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/14/1384417402398/John-Kerry-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Chip Somodevilla","altText":"John Kerry","suppliersReference":"188021284","height":"54","credit":"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","caption":"John Kerry speaks with reporters at the U.S. Capitol before testifying to the Senate banking committee.

President Rouhani's meeting w/WilliamJHague on the sidelines of UNGA has been confirmed,\" the tweet said.</p><p>\"We would be happy to meet,\" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said, \"but we have had nothing formal from Tehran about it.\"</p><p>Diplomats said that the tweet reflected the new Iranian government's eagerness to make diplomatic headway on the nuclear issue, which has been at an impasse for several years. A Hague meeting with either Rouhani or Zarif could clear the way to restoring full diplomatic ties, which have not existed since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011.</p><p>In a television interview aired on Sunday, Obama made clear that there was a diplomatic opening with Iran, not only over the nuclear question but also over Syria. He confirmed earlier reports that he and Rouhani had \"reached out\" to each other, exchanging letters.</p><p>US officials were sceptical about a Rouhani meeting, but some observers said the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons has opened new space for global diplomacy.</p><p>Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and an expert on US-Iran diplomacy, said \"I think there is a chance [of a meeting]. It would be a strong political push for movement. If Obama got involved, it would be the infusion of political will needed to reach an agreement.</p><p>\"Tehran is already claiming some of the credit for the Syria deal. Rouhani needs to show that through his diplomatic efforts he has already avoided a war. He is desperate in his first six months to show his approach has paid more dividends than the hardline approach of his predecessor.\"</p><p>Parsi added that if Obama was to meet Rouhani it was likely to be an orchestrated encounter in a corridor, rather than a sit-down talk, \"to give both sides deniability\". The last encounter between an American and Iranian leader was when Jimmy Carter met the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1977.</p><p>Speaking on ABC's This Week, Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region\". He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict\".</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged Iran's leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests. That a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilising,\" Obama said in the ABC interview, which was recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p><p>\"My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn't draw a lesson that [because] we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran,\" Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p><p>After meeting John Kerry, US secretary of state, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point. \"The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron – Iran,\" Netanyahu said. \"Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,\" he added.</p><p>However, Obama insisted: \"What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically. You know, negotiations with the Iranians are always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that … if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can strike a deal.\"</p>","headline":"Iran's Rouhani may meet Obama at UN after American president reaches out","trailText":"<p>First meeting of US and Iranian leaders since 1979 revolution could open way to diplomatic end to Iranian nuclear standoff</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/15/1379275543400/Irans-President-Hassan-Ro-005.jpg","wordcount":"864","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"417344382","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8077790","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, Diplomatic editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1965793","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-18T20:06:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","description":"The latest news and comment on Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

This year, all eyes are on the US and Iran","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:21:09Z","body":"<p>With a new moderate and media-savvy Iranian leadership in place and a White House looking for a quick diplomatic victory, there is speculation about the prospect of a historic \"chance encounter\" in the corridors of the UN general assembly next week. There is talk that Barack Obama might shake hands with Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, which would be the first direct encounter between US and Iranian leaders since Jimmy Carter and Shaha Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1977. Failing that, diplomats say that a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, could well be on the cards. That alone would be the highest-level exchange since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p>\"Corridor diplomacy\", or the fancy-meeting-you-here school of foreign policy, has a long if not a particularly proud history as a tool for statesmen and women who have not quite made up their minds whether they want to be seen together. That applies particularly to the always-tricky relationship between the US and Iran. The late US special envoy on Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, bumped into Iran's deputy foreign minister Mohammad-Mehdi Akhoondzadeh, at a conference on Afghanistan in The Hague in 2009. Holbrooke's boss at the time, Hillary Clinton, called it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7975079.stm\" title=\"\">\"a cordial exchange\"</a> and said the two would stay in touch. But they did not. The time was definitely not ripe in Tehran and Akhoondzadeh spent much of his ensuing career back in Tehran trying to play it down, if not deny it altogether.</p><p>The Hague incident was followed later that year by a \"sidebar\" meeting between US and Iranian diplomats at Geneva talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. The \"sidebar\" is a notch up on the corridor meeting. Chairs are usually provided, for example, and sometimes even a table, but the bottom line is that neither side is particularly committed to the outcome. As it turned out, that was the case in Geneva, and there has been no official contact between the two powers ever since.</p><p>However, general assembly week at the UN, beginning next Monday, is an ever-fertile environment for such coy diplomatic trysts as the corridors are so crowded with world leaders it is sometimes difficult to avoid each other. Obama's security detail went out of its way&nbsp;to make sure he did not get cornered into a grip-and-grin with Rouhani's fiercely outspoken predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In a 2009 Summit of the Americas meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, the president was trapped into an involuntary handshake with another nemesis, Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Chávez not only managed to sidle up to Obama but hand him a book, triggering much rightwing derision back in Washington. The cheeky publicity-hogging tactic subsequently became known as \"pulling a Chávez\".</p><p>Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw also found himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/28/zimbabwe.foreignpolicy\" title=\"\">unwittingly shaking the hand of an undesirable foreign leader</a>, in the shape of Robert Mugabe. Straw said later that it was an accident as he had been shaking lots of hands in a \"dark corner\" of the UN. But Gordon Brown suffered what is perhaps the opposite ignominy. In 2009, the then prime minister was desperate for some public face time with Obama. His team would have killed for some regular corridor diplomacy. Instead, the special relationship was relegated to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2009/09/obama_snub_deni.html\" title=\"\">a 15-minute \"walk and talk\"</a> out of sight in the UN's kitchens.</p><p>It was a reminder that political opportunity is forever rubbing shoulders with the potential for humiliation in the teeming halls of global diplomacy.</p>","headline":"Obama and the art of corridor diplomacy","trailText":"The UN general assembly often sees 'impromptu' meetings between leaders who would otherwise rather not be seen with each other.

Obama made a point of inviting Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted.</p><p>Speaking on ABC News television, Obama revealed that he had exchanged letters on the Syrian crisis with Rouhani, a moderate elected in June, and raised the prospect of Iran participation in global diplomacy on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but destabilising the entire region\".</p><p>He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would − deal with the underlying terrible conflict.\"</p><p>Rouhani is due to attend the United Nations general assembly next week, but it is not yet clear whether he will meet the US president there.</p><p>Britain's foreign office said on Sunday that the foreign secretary, William Hague, would meet his Iranian counterpart in New York, in what it called \"a positive step\" toward restoring full diplomatic ties between the two countries.</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged the Iranian leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the stand-off over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that – the nuclear issue – is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that – the threat against Iran – against Israel, that a nuclear Iran poses, is much closer to our core interests. That – a nuclear arms race in the region – is something that would be profoundly destabilising,\" the president said in an ABC interview recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p><p>\"My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn't draw a lesson that we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran,\" Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p><p>After a meeting with US secretary of state, John Kerry, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point.</p><p>\"The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron Iran. Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said.</p><p>However, Obama also stressed that there was also a more optimistic message for Iran arising from the Syrian deal with Russia.</p><p>\"What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically,\" the president said.</p><p>\"You know, negotiations with the Iranians [are] always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort ... you can you can strike a deal.\"</p>","headline":"Barack Obama warns Iran that US is still prepared to take military action","trailText":"US president seeks to shore up US deterrence in the Middle East and warns action against Iranian nuclear programme","newspaperPageNumber":"18","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379265443890/Barack-Obama-shore-up-pot-003.jpg","wordcount":"611","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"417338714","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8077329","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1965751","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-18T17:32:38Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/15/barack-obama-warns-iran-us-military-action","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/15/barack-obama-warns-iran-us-military-action","tags":[{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Within hours of the announcement, Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, announced she had contacted Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's new foreign minister, and agreed to meet on the sidelines of the UN meeting in New York later this month.</p><p>Ashton co-ordinates the '5+1' – the permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany –  who have been in largely fruitless talks with Iran over its nuclear programme for seven years. The last round was in Istanbul in May.</p><p>Iranian negotiators have been led since 2003 by the Secretary of the SNSC, at that time none other than Rouhani, who took Iran into two years of negotiations with the European Union during which Tehran suspended all uranium enrichment before a tentative, preliminary agreement broke down.</p><p>Rouhani's new move is partly to create a clearer decision-structure but also reflects his confidence in Zarif, who is US-educated as well as known to many US politicians, including vice-president Joe Biden, from his stint in New York from 2002 to 2007 as Iran's UN representative.</p><p>\"Having a new foreign minister, the first to be respected internationally in three decades, and also a quick decision-making process between him and the president, this is the only workable way to tackle the crippling nuclear crisis,\" said Kourosh Zaim, a leading member of the opposition National Front party in Tehran.</p><p>In the reformist press, Samira Farahbakhsh argued in Mardom Salaarie (Democracy) that Zarif was \"held in high esteem\" by western diplomats given his \"relatively comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of Western players\".</p><p>It has also been argued it was important for Rouhani to put talks under a diplomatic rather than a security rubric.</p><p>Iran Diplomacy, a website associated with Sadegh Kharrazi, former ambassador to both the UN and France, has posted an <a href=\"http://www.irdiplomacy.ir/fa/page/1921026/پایان+نگاه+امنیتی+به+مذاکرات+هسته+ای.html\">article</a> headlined The End of Viewing Nuclear Negotiations a Security Issue, suggesting the move \"tells foreigners that Iran has changed the character of the issue from one of security to diplomatic/political, and that they should reconsider their stance as well...[as understanding] the Iranian side is looking  for a win-win outcome\".</p><p>Kharrazi is close to Zarif, and the pair worked together closely on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/03/iran-nuclear-weapons\">2003 Grand Bargain offer to the United States</a>, an initiative ignored by the Bush administration.</p><p>The article reiterates Kharrazi's experience that Iran requires a positive response from Washington: \"Of course, the transfer of the dossier from SNSC to the foreign ministry doesn't necessarily suggest that Iran will step back from its [claim to] legal rights [for nuclear development under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty], or that this impasse will be resolved and overcome quickly. Resolution of such an impasse depends on the political will of all sides, and for as long as such a will doesn't exist, then the best decision-making systems and the most astute diplomats will produce nothing.\"</p><p>But domestically at least, Rouhani seems to have the momentum with him after his overwhelming presidential election victory in June. When he held talks with the Europeans between 2003 and 2005, Rouhani and his negotiating team were subject to stinging attacks in the conservative press. So far, as president Rouhani has experienced nothing of the sort.</p><p>In 2003-05 the Kayhan newspaper led the way with a series of critical editorials by Hossein Shariatmadari, who as editor-in-chief is an appointee of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In reacting to the transfer of the nuclear file to the foreign ministry, the paper has <a href=\"http://www.kayhan.ir/920616/2.htm#N203 \">simply noted the move</a>, offering no immediate analysis or opinion.<br /> <br />Similarly, Resalat, a daily close to the right-leaning Motalefeh (coalition) Party, has chosen silence.</p><p>Raja News, a website staunchly in support of the still SNSC secretary and defeated presidential candidate Saeed Jalili, has also been mute, prompting speculation in Tehran that Ayatollah Khamenei's office has advised editors not to criticise Rouhani at a delicate time in international affairs.</p><p>Not that the SNSC is entirely out of the picture.  In an interview with the semi-governmental Mehr News Agency, Zarif said talks would be carried out \"in consultations with the SNSC and other relevant organs\". Marzieh Afkham, the first female spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, has also spoken of \"necessary co-ordination\" with the SNSC.</p><p>One editor-in-chief of a reformist publication told Tehran Bureau he was sceptical about the whole move. \"It seems to me that decision-making will remain with the council,\" he said. \"The foreign affairs ministry can only execute the council's decisions. We have to see if the negotiation strategy will change, or just the faces of the negotiators.\"</p><p>But the editor did concede that Zarif is \"a truly powerful negotiator\".</p><p>Zaim, a long-term critic of the Iranian authorities, was even more optimistic in foreseeing a \"U-turn in IRI foreign diplomacy from hard-headedness and stupidity to some sort of wisdom\".</p><p>Zaim added that he hoped Rouhani and Zarif would be given room – at home and abroad – to find solutions. \"This turnabout of course is a good sign and we hope it will bear positive results provided the 5+1 also approach the upcoming negotiations with [an] intent to resolve the crisis,\" he said. \"I believe the Supreme Leader is taking a back seat in this process, because it is a do or die proposition.\" <br /> <br />A professor in Iran told Tehran Bureau he was delighted to see the end of Saeed Jalili's responsibility for handling the nuclear talks. \"He never learned anything about diplomatic protocols except for his mistimed and misplaced smiles. I can truly call Jalili the most incapable Iranian diplomat since the Qajar dynasty [1779-1924].\"</p><p>‎<em>Tehran Bureau's Nuclear Watch series monitors the way the Iranian media reports the country's nuclear programme</em></p>","headline":"Iran's conservatives silent as Rouhani puts nuclear talks on diplomatic footing","trailText":"<p>Nuclear watch: Iranian president gives foreign affairs minister responsibility for negotiations with the west</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3tyq7","wordcount":"960","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417150062","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tehran Bureau correspondent","internalPageCode":"1964635","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-15T17:40:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/iran-nuclear-weapons-talks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/iran-nuclear-weapons-talks","tags":[{"id":"world/series/tehran-bureau","webTitle":"Tehran Bureau","description":"The Tehran Bureau is an independent news organisation, hosted by the Guardian, offering original reporting, comment and analysis on one of the world's most important stories.

Avoiding any pledge of specific support, he raised his palms in prayer, saying: \"I hope merciful God protects this region from the menace of America and Zionism and other evils.\"</p><p>Khamenei's silence about defending Assad was underscored by a subsequent report from the semi-official Fars news agency on a speech delivered by General Mohammad Ali Jafari, chief of the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. In extensive excerpts of his address to a conference of ground force commanders, there was not a single word about Syria.</p><p>A year ago, by contrast, Colonel Mohammad Ali Asoodi, the head of the guards' culture and propaganda office, said: \"If America attacks Syria, Iran, along with Syrian allies will go into action.\"</p><p>The tone of General Masoud Jazayeri, the deputy chief-of-staff of Iran's armed forces, took a particularly noticeable turn this week.</p><p>On Sunday, he had threatened: \"The United States is aware of the red zone of the Syrian front and any violation of the Syrian red line will have serious consequences for the White House,\" including revenge by multiple nations.</p><p>Three days later, however, he said little more than that an internationalised war would be a net loss to Israel. Like Khamenei, the only intervention he invoked was divine. \"God willing, the flames of this conflagration will set Zionism's robe ablaze,\" he said.</p><p>He refrained from making any threats towards the US, and settled for offering advice: \"The Americans should rid themselves of this arrogant self-assuredness and if they have any resources, spend them on saving the American people.\"</p><p>A Middle East analyst in Tehran said: \"It is evident that Khamenei is worried enough about his nuclear programme and isn't scrambling for a new headache for himself. He has also gotten this into the heads of his vociferous commanders, who love belligerent oration. Why? Because he has understood that this is not a joke anymore.\"</p><p>It is also likely that Iranian leaders see the sort of strike being mooted as no more than a rap on Assad's knuckles, rather than a step towards bringing down his government. Exercising restraint at this juncture will not only keep Iran from wading into an inferno, but will also maintain its ability to influence Syrian politics in the future.</p><p>That said, such restraint may pose its own problems as, according to many reports, Tehran and Damascus signed a mutual defence treaty in 2006. The Iranian student news agency (ISNA), however, recently quoted the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, as denying that any agreement of the sort existed.</p><p>One reformist political activist said: \"I have not heard Moallem's words, but it is clear that Tehran feels that the rumours of this hairy pact are now prickling its nose. Tehran is agitated over unconstrained actions carried out in Syria without co-ordination [with Iran]. I have no doubt Moallem has denied [the existence of] this defensive pact under pressure from Tehran.\"</p><p>Provocative declarations continue to appear in conservative media outlets, such as the influential Kayhan daily, edited by long-time regime insider Hossein Shariatmadari and widely thought to reflect Khamenei's views. In a Wednesday editorial headlined \"Day of Fate Is at Hand\", it welcomed a western attack on Syria with open arms: \"It's time to wonder if we should not take the probable idiocy of the US and its allies as a positive omen.\"</p><p>The paper suggested that western intervention would serve only to yield three results, each of benefit to Iran: hasten the collapse of the Saudi and Qatari regimes; incite the Syrian population to destroy the Salafist rebel forces; and unify the remaining Islamic factions in the war zone against the US and Israel.</p><p>Kayhan editorials have often been seen as testing the water for regime policies, but the editor-in-chief of a reformist publication said: \"Don't take Shariatmadari seriously any more. His perch has collapsed since the elections. No one pays attention or anything else to his words. Of course, he is Khamenei's proxy, but Khamenei has a thousand and one proxies all over the place and each one sings a different tune.\"</p><p>In the eyes of some commentators, recent events suggest that Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have been able to get the upper hand in influencing the supreme leader. The lack of a vehement reaction from Tehran to the possibility of a strike on Syria could indicate that the regime is prepared to adopt a much more moderate approach to engagement with the west than was the case during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's eight years as president.</p><p>One Iranian analyst, who spoke on condition of full anonymity, holds a very different opinion. \"The Iranian establishment will stick to its guns,\" he said. \"Zarif and others may use a different, less confrontational tone than Ahmadinejad, but national interests are national interests. If they take Syria, Iran is next, from the Iranian perspective.</p><p>\"Iran hasn't been spending all these resources in Syria for nothing these past decades. Syria was a critical ally during the Iran-Iraq war. [Assad's father, Hafez] supported Iran against Saddam and kept Arab states from forming a united front against the newly formed Islamic Republic in the 1980s.</p><p>\"Even if the shah were in power, he would help [Syria]. It's a matter of national interest.\"</p>","headline":"Iran's reaction to possible US attack on Syria shows signs of restraint","trailText":"Behind the more moderate rhetoric, however, some expect Tehran to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Damascus if the latter is attacked","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377865402768/Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-005.jpg","wordcount":"999","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"416160131","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8012379","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tehran Bureau correspondent","internalPageCode":"1958223","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-06T12:23:47Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/aug/30/iran-us-attack-syria-restraint","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran-blog/2013/aug/30/iran-us-attack-syria-restraint","tags":[{"id":"world/series/tehran-bureau","webTitle":"Tehran Bureau","description":"The Tehran Bureau is an independent news organisation, hosted by the Guardian, offering original reporting, comment and analysis on one of the world's most important stories.
