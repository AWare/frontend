Highlights include opening film The Guest, which promises Downton’s Dan Stevens as you’ve never seen him before. Hostel director Eli Roth shows his appetite for the cannibal genre in The Green Inferno, in which environmental activists end up on the menu of the tribe they were travelling to protect. Finally, toxic waste turns some furry critters into… Zombeavers.</p><p><em>Vue West End, WC2, Thu to 25 Aug</em></p><h2>Art Party!, Nationwide</h2><p>To coincide with the announcement of this year’s GCSE results, the mischievous agit-prop film Art Party! features a loose collective of artists, headed by Patrick Brill (under the name Bob And Roberta Smith), who challenge the diminishing value placed by the government on art and design in schools. A politician called Michael Grove (geddit?) is taken to task about the situation in what is a clear broadside at the current government’s policies. Cinemas screening the film, which is described as “part documentary, part road movie and part political fantasy”, will be hosting their own parties to reflect the project’s mix of fun and fury; schools and galleries will also be participating. Artists including Jeremy Deller and Cornelia Parker turn up on screen, as well as the sculptor Richard Wentworth, who warns, “Without art, people won’t love each other. They won’t even hold hands.”</p><p><em>Various venues, Thu</em></p><h2>Goblin, London</h2><p>If FrightFest doesn’t satisfy your horror needs in the coming week, try gorging on screenings of two undimmed gems —George A Romero’s Dawn Of The Dead and Dario Argento’s Suspiria. That’s tempting enough. What makes it unmissable is a UK first: live musical accompaniment on both nights by the peerless prog rock wizards Goblin, whose outlandish and beautiful scores are synonymous with the giallo genre. Changes in Goblin personnel over the decades have rivalled even the Fall, but three founder members (Claudio Simonetti, Maurizio Guarini and Massimo Morante) feature in the current incarnation. Simonetti will be taking part in a Q&amp;A before both of the performances. </p><p><em>Union Chapel, N1, Mon &amp; Tue</em></p><h2>God Help The Girl, Nationwide</h2><p>Ahead of its full UK release come previews of this bittersweet pick-me-up of a musical, the directing debut of Belle &amp; Sebastian’s frontman Stuart Murdoch. It concerns a chirpy but damaged girl (Emily Browning) who teams up in a band with a buoyant, shambolic musician (Olly Alexander) and pal (Hannah Murray). The enchanting, Sphinx-like Browning is already a star; the dynamic Alexander should become one after this. The movie’s pleasures are nicely old-school; its rhythm is relaxed (no Chicago-style stroboscopic editing here), and the songs nudge the story forward, as numbers always should in a musical. As if to prove he hasn’t given up the day job, Murdoch will also lead the band in a live post-film performance via satellite from the Edinburgh Corn Exchange.</p><p><em>Various venues, Sat, godhelpthegirl.com</em></p>","headline":"This week's film events","trailText":"Art Party! | FrightFest | Goblin | God Help The Girl","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407938294662/20beee35-4971-489a-8501-cbc832e15d3a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"478","commentable":"true","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-19T05:00:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/16/this-weeks-film-events","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/16/this-weeks-film-events","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ryangilbey","webTitle":"Ryan Gilbey","r2ContributorId":"25456","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/4/1304527589092/ryan_gilby.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ryan Gilbey is film critic of the New Statesman and writes on film for the Guardian, Sunday Times and Sight &amp; Sound</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ryangilbey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ryangilbey","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide/reviews","webTitle":"Previews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide","webTitle":"The Guide","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-b7fc0827-d860-4c2e-981c-27f48a937923","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407938293791/20beee35-4971-489a-8501-cbc832e15d3a-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407938293791/20beee35-4971-489a-8501-cbc832e15d3a-220x132.jpeg","source":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","photographer":"Allstar/WORLDVIEW ENTERTAINMENT","altText":"The Green Inferno","suppliersReference":"ENT_SAI32544","height":"132","credit":"Allstar/WORLDVIEW ENTERTAINMENT/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","caption":"The Green Inferno, showing at FrightFest.

But in addition to these classic works, the film can’t escape some of the Young Adult film tropes we’ve been inundated with of late, right down to the love triangles and power of destiny. As such, many of the plot mechanics, as opposed to headier social science themes, feel familiar, and this isn’t a good thing. </p><p>Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) lives in a Garden of Epcot, a perfect classless society in a future with no war, no hunger and where it hardly every rains. Everyone’s crisp white clothing and polite, sunny demeanour comes, of course, at a cost unknown to them. The citizens of this utopia are actually being drugged, constantly observed and the glorious culture only works, it’s discovered, due to a complex system of cruel eugenics and euthanasia. The Giver’s kick, however, is that the Community’s elders (led by Meryl Streep, who, unfortunately, gets little screen time, and what she does is via future-Skype) aren’t even sure themselves just how they are oppressing the citizenry. The powerful know they are pulling strings in an abstract sense, but are still wilfully (and blissfully) ignorant of specifics. You see, at some point after a devastating war, this society was built in such a way that knowledge of history would be <em>verboten</em>. All that exists is equanimity and sameness. </p><p>But someone along the way recognised that running things, even a controlled society, can be difficult. We need the wisdom of history in order to learn from our past. Thus one chosen individual is the Receiver of Memory, a living, breathing Wikipedia, the only person in town who knows about snow or laughing puppies or piano concertos. Or kissing. The flip side is, he’ll be the one who knows about death, violence and loss.</p><p>Jeff Bridges, bearded and working some inscrutable funny accent, is the current Receiver, but Jonas is the next Chosen One. The bulk of the movie dives in to explore the corners of this slightly familiar (Logan’s Run’s “Carousel” is just called “Elsewhere”) but still fascinating set-up. One can easily see why this is such a popular book, especially with teens roiling with angst and hoping to lash out at society. Young Jonas broods at home and around his former classmates and actually wouldn’t be wrong if he shouted “none of you understand me!” But he’s a good kid and he soon realises that his destiny lies in tearing the system down.</p><p>Phillip Noyce, whose better films include Dead Calm, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Salt, exploits a nice gimmick rooted in the story’s mythos. Those fully entrenched in the community (let’s call it Giverdale) see everything in black and white, but as sensei Bridges starts mind-melding with Jonas, colour starts to work its way into the frame. Again, this is a trick we’ve seen before (Pleasantville, Zentropa – aka Europa) but if you buy The Giver’s subtext that all of human existence is the repetition and reinterpretation of the same story, these constant feelings of thematic deja vu help it sell the premise.</p><p>The Giver is a mid-budget film but it still looks great. There’s still no finer film detailing a futureworld suburbia than Woody Allen’s Sleeper, but the well-lit and nicely maintained parks of The Giver make a good case for a lifestyle of historical ignorance and curated vocabulary. There’s also the recurring three-point visual motif, which extends, naturally, to best bud Asher (Cameron Monaghan) and gal pal Fiona (Odeya Rush). Indeed, Jonas and Fiona meet for secret whispers inside a bit of landscaping that <em>slightly</em> resembles a woman’s pubic triangle, the penetration point being a gush of water that accentuates everyone’s form-fitting clothing.</p><p>These pleasures aside, there’s the problem of the script. Some of the dialogue is atrocious. Many times exposition or bright ideas are just dumped on the screen like a harried mother leaving her kids at summer camp. There are some tweaks to the ending not found in the book that really don’t make a whole lot of sense, but work as big movie moments of heightened tension and visual effects. By the end of the movie few won’t be rolling their eyes or checking their watch, but there’s enough that’s fundamentally good in the meat of film not to wholly reject what The Giver is giving us.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/25/jeff-bridges-comic-con-the-giver-lois-lowry\">Jeff Bridges tells Comic-Con of struggle to get Lois Lowry’s The Giver filmed</a><br></li></ul>","headline":"The Giver – first look review: Utopia isn't all it's cracked up to be, again","trailText":"Phillip Noyce’s futureworld looks great and despite a dodgy script and some familiar tropes it gets the essentials right, writes <strong>Jordan Hoffman</strong><br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408113565831/c91b0d15-0acf-42db-a513-e68dc54aeb95-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"751","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-18T11:45:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/15/the-giver-first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/15/the-giver-first-look-review","tags":[{"id":"film/the-giver","webTitle":"The Giver","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-giver","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-giver","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/sciencefictionandfantasy","webTitle":"Science fiction and fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

Sheffield Wednesday got to the final of the FA and the Coca Cola Cups (albeit to be pipped to the post by Arsenal on both occasions), Meatloaf’s I Would Do Anything For Love got to number one, and Tarantino’s True Romance came out.</p><p>At the age of eight, however, I was too busy having a crush on Chris Waddle and perusing JD Sports’ shinpad selection down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/09/sheffield-meadowhall-shopping-centre-for-sale\">Meadowhall</a> to even think about trying to slip into the local cinema to see this Tony Scott-directed classic; sweet and dark in almost equal measure. It was only later that, watching this bubble gum chewing, Snapple-drinking, metallic turquoise Rayban-wearing incarnation of Patricia Arquette, I was struck dumb. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8-Vxm7DBbk\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8-Vxm7DBbk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Alabama Whitman’s been a call girl for “exactly 4 days” before she’s paid to bump into comic store assistant Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) as he partakes in his annual birthday Sonny Chiba triple feature – Street Fighter, Return of the Street Fighter and Sister Street Fighter – alone. They fall for one another instantly and crashingly and, in a scene that on the more hungover of days I could happily watch on repeat, Alabama professes her romantic ethic like it were a mantra: “when it comes to relationships I’m 100%… I’m 100%… monogamous. If I’m with you, then I’m with you, and I don’t want to be with anybody else.”</p><p>It wasn’t just that Alabama Whitman was able to pull off cowboy boots, cow print mini skirts, pink and blue leopard print leggings, off-the-shoulder blouses and neon bras, often simultaneously; though that no doubt helped. (Plus inspired some ill-advised attempts at mimicry – one bid to dress as Alabama at a 90s-themed house party ended with me claiming I’d intentionally gone for a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101050/\">Blossom</a>/Alabama hybrid look to cover the shame).</p><p>It was also that Alabama’s badass, and, crucially, lovely too. She does what her namesake poet advices and “<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/39/45.html\">stands up for the stupid and crazy</a>.” So dogged is she that, in a wincingly violent fight scene, even the man who was later to become Tony Soprano concedes, “you’ve got a lot of heart, kid”. She giggles her way through crisis and – with her poetic monologues that bookend the film in a Badlands homage – she manages somehow to rise above the bloodbath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYE-qg4RBO0\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYE-qg4RBO0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In her honeysuckle southern drawl, spoken to the chime of the Carl Orff/Hans Zimmer theme, she talks of her clarity of thought: “Amid the chaos of that day, when all I could hear was the thunder of gunshots, and all I could smell was the violence in the air, I look back and am amazed that my thoughts were so clear and true, that three words went through my mind endlessly… you’re so cool, you’re so cool, you’re so cool.” </p><p>Clarence might be cool, but Alabama’s no second best. As things unravel in grand Tarantino style – cocaine’s stolen, guns are cocked and blood’s spilt in rivers – Alabama is the sugar-y glue keeping things from becoming irrevocably unstuck. </p>","headline":"Why I'd like to be … Patricia Arquette in True Romance","trailText":"In the final part of our series in which Guardian writers nominate their cinematic heroes, Ellie Violet Bramley raises a Snapple to Alabama Whitman, the lovely badass who rises above the violence of Tony Scott’s True Romance","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408110800930/a8013d57-3775-49ef-9195-8e14919fde5b-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"497","commentable":"true","byline":"Ellie Violet Bramley","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-18T14:36:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/15/why-id-like-to-be-alabama-whitman-in-true-romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/15/why-id-like-to-be-alabama-whitman-in-true-romance","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/role-model","webTitle":"Role model","description":"Writers on which movie characters they emulated growing up - or they still model themselves on today","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/role-model","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/quentintarantino","webTitle":"Quentin Tarantino","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/quentintarantino","references":[]},{"id":"film/tony-scott","webTitle":"Tony Scott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tony-scott","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/tony-scott","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ellie-violet-bramley","webTitle":"Ellie Violet Bramley","r2ContributorId":"60379","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ellie writes on culture, social justice and, all too often, Point Break.

Can you think of any other clips to add to the list?

There's eye candy (a lot), brain  food (a bit), an ass-whupping antiheroine (an abundance thereof), and an 89-minute running time  that means you can still fit in a Jamie's Italian before bedtime. In other words, it's a welcome return to the Luc Besson of the 1990s.</p><p>Playing on the old myth that we use only 10% of our brains, Scarlett Johansson is the partying student and reluctant drug mule who becomes an action hero, then superhero, as the narcotics involuntarily stuffed in her stomach seep into her bloodstream, that 10% rising rapidly to 100%. The film hurtles along as her brain goes full-throttle. The drug, says Besson, is inspired by \"a molecule that pregnant women create after six weeks – a super atomic bomb for a baby\". He knows the 10% brain capacity theory is hokum. \"What's true, though, is that we only use 15% of our neurons at the same time,\" he says. \"But it's never the same 15%. So we can ask ourselves, what happens to us if we can suddenly have 30%, 40%, 50% of our neurons working at the same time? I changed the reality a little to help the story.\"</p><p>As a director Besson has had an iffy 21st century, and Lucy, while not his best, is a good reminder of why he made such an impact in the first place. 1988's The Big Blue was a plaintive, pretty paean to his love of deep-sea diving, but 1990's Nikita introduced Besson as a turbo-charged action director: with Anne Parillaud as a murderer-turned-spy, it boasted a no-nonsense female shit-kicker a year before James Cameron brought us Terminator 2. Besson went bigger and better with Léon, giving Natalie Portman her first role as a 12-year-old apprentice assassin in love with a taciturn middle-aged hitman; then he went huge with The Fifth Element, an arty, bonkers sci-fi featuring an arty, bonkers alien (Milla Jovovich). The French critical consensus was that he was a crass sell-out in thrall to Hollywood; Hollywood welcomed him with open arms.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444629957'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407944028941/Lucy-2014-011.jpg' alt='Lucy 2014' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Scarlett Johansson in Luc Besson's Lucy. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX</figcaption></figure><p>Tonally, Lucy is Besson in a blender, with shades of both The Fifth Element's sense of desperation and wonder, and the gung-ho, wham-bam spirit of the Taken/Transporter/Taxi films he's spent the last few years writing and producing. Not that he agrees. \"When I make a film I'm not even thinking about anything else,\" he says. \"Lucy is the first time I've taken a character who is totally normal at the beginning of the film. She's Miss Nobody. She's studying, she's partying too much, she doesn't know what to do with her life; a totally average girl. Most of the time I start with amazing people, like Aung San Suu Kyi [in The Lady], or [Fifth Element's] Leeloo. So for me, she is totally different from anything I've done.\"</p><p>Lucy puts every man in the film in the shade by several degrees. It's a Besson motif: the scripts he writes for others may be testosterone-heavy but the majority of those he keeps for himself feature headstrong female leads. Again, he dismisses the idea: \"When I started to think about Lucy nine years ago, I knew the film would be for me, but I didn't know the protagonist would be female. It's more than whether it's a female. If I think another director could miss the point, I don't want to give it away.\"</p><p>He's certainly happy to give away his brawnier ideas. His Jason Statham/Liam Neeson vehicles – less idiosyncratic and less conceptual than the films he directs – have proved lucrative for his company, EuropaCorp. Those are Besson's franchises, and onwards those juggernauts roll. The Transporter is currently being rebooted, while the third Taken film wraps two days before we speak. He initially said that Taken would be a one-off. After the sequel, he said, OK, really this time, that's it. Money, presumably, changes his mind: the first film cost $25m and made $227m, while the second made $376m.</p><p>Business aside, these movies clearly work. The Taken films hit home, says Besson, because they play on parents' fears for their kids and, at the same time, provide wish-fulfilment. \"Every dad dreams about being Bryan Mills, and every daughter dreams of having Bryan Mills as a dad,\" he says, and he justifies milking the conceit. \"After the first one, I couldn't see how we could do a sequel. We decided to do a continuation of the first one. The first one the girl is taken, the second one they take vengeance. It's one story. The third one is an original. It's the same family, but nobody is taken. The dog is not taken.\"</p><p>One assumes money is a big factor in the films he doesn't direct, but he's more protective over those he does. He refuses to follow up The Fifth Element, and, thankfully, hasn't given in to those demanding a Léon sequel. \"You can't imagine how many people ask me for a Léon sequel,\" he says. \"Everywhere I go they ask me. If I was motivated by money I would have done it a long time ago. But I don't feel it.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444629958'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407944385309/Leon-1994-009.jpg' alt='Leon 1994' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The hitman and her: Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in Léon. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/BUENA VISTA</figcaption></figure><p>The longer we talk, the deeper Besson is keen  to get, assuring me the appeal of Lucy as a project was philosophical. \"What's interesting is the definition of humanity,\" he says. \"Watch the news tonight. When you see the state of humanity today…  I mean, come on, it's a mess.\" Lucy's message, he says, is that when you have power, the best thing to do is to share it. When I ask what sort of films he's burning to make, he says how much he values the purity of children over adult cynicism, and would like to do something with that.</p><p>People tell him, he says, that he's a big kid himself, and his parents' divorce, when he was 10 years old, has influenced his career. \"Here is two families,\" he once told the New York Times, \"and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn't work. And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here.\"</p><p>Does he still feel that rage?</p><p>\"No, I don't have it any more,\" he says, confessing that film-making is therapeutic.</p><p>\"You have a suitcase full  of souvenirs and trauma, and when you're young your suitcase is always open. When you become an adult you learn how to close it, and to open it when you need it. And that's what I learned. So I always have my suitcase, with all my scars. But I can live with it. I can handle it. And when I write or direct a film I open it, I use it, and then I close it! I'm not bothered by it any more. But you don't forget it.  It's nice to have a suitcase.\"</p><p><em>Lucy is in cinemas from Friday</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/23/-sp-lucy-scarlett-johansson-first-look-review\">• First-look review: Lucy</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/28/scarlett-johansson-lucy-tops-us-box-office-the-rock-hercules\">• Lucy's US box office</a></p>","headline":"Luc Besson: 'You can't imagine how many people ask me for a Léon sequel'","trailText":"<p>Instead of playing it safe, the French director wants to reinvent the candyfloss action genre with his new film Lucy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407943563669/Luc-Besson-006.jpg","wordcount":"1144","commentable":"true","byline":"Alex Godfrey","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-18T12:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/15/luc-besson-lucy-scarlett-johannson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/15/luc-besson-lucy-scarlett-johannson","tags":[{"id":"film/lucy","webTitle":"Lucy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lucy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/lucy","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide","webTitle":"The Guide","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"film/scarlettjohansson","webTitle":"Scarlett Johansson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/scarlettjohansson","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alex-godfrey","webTitle":"Alex Godfrey","r2ContributorId":"45534","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-godfrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alex-godfrey","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-444629955","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407943574469/Luc-Besson-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Vittorio Zunino Celotto","altText":"Luc Besson","suppliersReference":"453291302","height":"276","credit":"Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images","caption":"They call him Monsieur Boombastic: Lucy director Luc Besson.

He is suing Daniels for “unpaid principal, interest and royalties,” <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2014/08/14/damon-dash-sues-lee-daniels-for-25m-in-movie-royalities/\">according to the New York Post</a>, and was left out of producer credits on the films.</p><p>“It’s very upsetting because there was a certain point where Lee was up-and-coming and Damon, as a music mogul and producer, really saw potential,” Dash’s lawyer Natraj Bhushan told the newspaper. “Lee went on to a very successful career and all Damon wants is what he’s rightfully entitled to.” Daniels has not yet commented on the lawsuit.</p><p>Dash is also suing Simone Sheffield, a talent manager who has also got producer credits on Daniels’ films. Dash accuses her of claiming he was heading to jail, and that she was an “obstacle” to his professional relationship with Daniels. It’s the latest legal saga for Dash, who was <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/damon-dash-takes-stand-1-million-civil-case-article-1.1721903\">sued earlier this year</a> by an ex-girlfriend, and mother of his child, for allegedly having her arrested on charges of harassment. </p><p>Dash found huge financial success via his partnership with Jay Z. The pair built up the Roc-A-Fella record label, releasing a string of hit Jay Z albums and nurturing the likes of Kanye West and Cam’ron; their spinoff clothing label, Rocawear, was also successful. But their relationship frayed, and once Def Jam bought out Roc-A-Fella and installed Jay Z as president, Dash became estranged from the company. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/mar/15/the-paperboy-video-review\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1880829\"                data-video-name=\"The Paperboy - video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-405647428\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/3/15/1363346595625/Still-from-The-Paperboy-011.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/3/15/130315CutdownPaperboy-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/3/15/130315CutdownPaperboy-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130315CutdownPaperboy/130315CutdownPaperboy.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/3/15/130315CutdownPaperboy_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/3/15/130315CutdownPaperboy_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Lee Daniels’ film The Paperboy reviewed by the Guardian film team</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite earning over $10m from the buyout, he ran into money trouble.

The frame cuts to a wobbly shot of her screaming and the group are never seen again. That final image of them disappearing lingers like a vision of ghosts.<br><br>The scene feels half real, half not, with a spiritual intensity inseparable from the landscape. It’s as if the natural order of things has taken a supremely unnatural turn, and everything around the characters – the sky, the birds, the grass and rocks – joined forces to create a haunting day-mare.</p><p>The Last Wave, Weir’s magnificent follow-up film (released in 1977) has an unsettling surreal energy that seems to exist entirely in that moment, where something as ordinary as the weather becomes an instrument of terror and suspense.</p><p>The title isn’t a reference to a movement or an era; it is something far more literal. The manner with which water seeps into the film – from storms to dreams to a finale almost end-of-the-world in its scale – creates its key recurring motif.</p><p>“I suppose I’ve been shaving some mornings and I’ve watched water coming out of the tap and I’ve thought it seems to be under control. What if I couldn’t turn it off, and no plumber could?” said Peter Weir in <a href=\"http://www10.pair.com/crazydv/weir/articles/articlei.html\">an interview</a> published in 1979.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkpDFheL79E\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkpDFheL79E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Conceptually similar to writer/director Jeff Nichols’s acclaimed 2011 indie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/24/take-shelter-review\">Take Shelter</a>, about a paranoid man convinced an apocalyptic storm is coming, the story revolves around a logical-thinking lawyer who gradually comes to realise his place in a mystical narrative related to the Dreamtime.<br><br>If the premise sounds airy, Weir’s execution (working from a tremendous screenplay by Tony Morphett and Petru Popescu) feels unerringly realistic, even when the story spills into the realm of the fantastical. <br><br>David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) takes on the job of defending a group of Indigenous people accused of murdering an Aboriginal man. The cause of death is uncertain and nobody’s talking. Investigating the case, and road-blocked at every turn, he comes to believe it may involve tribal rituals and that arguing so in court provides an angle for the defence. </p><p>A colleague dispels this idea and implores him not to raise it. “The people we call Aborigines in the city, are no different than depressed whites,” he says. “We destroyed their languages, their ceremonies, songs, dances – and their tribal law.”<br><br>Real and unreal merge when one of the five people accused of murder, Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) materialises from David’s dreams. Chris is unsurprised to hear he’s transmogrified from the lawyer’s subconscious state to his real life, and when a mysterious companion named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) arrives things get even weirder.<br><br>The first courtroom scene, which occurs over an hour into the film, has David interrogating Chris about sacred sites and what it means to be tribal. It feels like an amalgamation of a wider search for meaning: the western world attempting – and failing – to rationalise ancient Aboriginal spirituality.</p><p>How Weir links small details of his protagonist’s journey to turning points involving mysticism, prophecy and the end of times is a masterful exercise in dual narrative trajectory – a series of personal turmoils matched with a wider, far-reaching dilemma. </p><p>Like that great disquieting moment in Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Last Wave pits human beings against awesome natural phenomena and makes a point about our helplessness in the scheme of things. </p><p>Current concerns about climate change give the film’s prophetic ideas more potency. It was released in the US with the title Black Rain, which sounds similarly symbolic. In one of the film’s many strange scenes, it is revealed as something disturbingly literal. </p>","headline":"The Last Wave rewatched – mysticism, prophecy and the end of times","trailText":"Weather becomes an instrument of terror and suspense in this Peter Weir classic, writes<strong> Luke Buckmaster</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408069878136/de2cd4bb-ba59-4a52-89b1-992fc8d4b12b-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"653","commentable":"true","byline":"Luke Buckmaster","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-18T15:15:00+10:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/aug/15/the-last-wave-rewatched-mysticism-prophecy-and-the-end-of-times","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/aug/15/the-last-wave-rewatched-mysticism-prophecy-and-the-end-of-times","tags":[{"id":"film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","webTitle":"Rewatching classic Australian films","description":"In this retrospective series we rewatch Australian films that have stood the test of time.","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/peter-weir","webTitle":"Peter Weir","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-weir","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/peter-weir","references":[]},{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog","webTitle":"Australia culture blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/luke-buckmaster","webTitle":"Luke Buckmaster","r2ContributorId":"57812","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/24/1374653245685/Luke-Buckshot.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Luke Buckmaster is a Melbourne-based film critic who blogs about cinema for <a href=\"http://blogs.crikey.com.au/cinetology\">Crikey</a> and contributes commentary and criticism to a range of Australian publications</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/luke-buckmaster","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/luke-buckmaster","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-59deb777-71e1-4123-9717-3822123f33ba","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408069878630/9e630225-8e43-413c-8508-35659fdcf972-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408069878630/9e630225-8e43-413c-8508-35659fdcf972-68x68.jpeg","source":"PR","altText":"David Gulpilil and Richard Chamberlain in The Last Wave","height":"68","credit":"PR","caption":"David Gulpilil and Richard Chamberlain in The Last Wave: an unsettling, surreal energy.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/audio/2011/feb/17/film-weekly-podcast-david-michod\" title=\"\">Australian director David Michôd</a> a dystopian Ozbilly noir set in a ruined future: it's violent, alienated and speckled with gruesome little details. You could also call it a shaggy dog story – if the dog in question was red of eye and foamy of mouth. There's a flavour of the 70s Australian new wave, and even something of Spielberg's Duel. But after a terrific start, the film begins to lose its way, and its grip, and it isn't as good as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/24/animal-kingdom-review\" title=\"\">Michôd's earlier feature, Animal Kingdom</a>. Robert Pattinson plays a young, scared guy called Rey, part of a gang of American armed robbers who have left him for dead in the dusty road&nbsp;after their raid went horribly wrong. Why Americans are in this particular part of Australia is never explained, and I suspect the original script Michôd developed with Joel Edgerton has been modified for casting reasons. Having crashed their truck, the gang impulsively steal a parked car belonging to a bearded loner called Eric, played with blazing-eyed intensity by Guy Pearce. With fanatical determination, Eric sets out to get his car back, using Rey to help him in this quest. The car is perhaps the last vestige of his self-respect, or maybe, somewhere in his scorched soul, he thinks that using it as the pretext for brutally violent revenge is an appropriately suicidal farewell to all happiness. The script meanders around as it makes a tour of all the freaky, scary figures out there in the wasteland: feral exotics in a weird, Diane Arbus-like world of their own. Michôd creates ambient menace and Pearce has a simmering presence. But there is a bit of muddle: the business with the truck and the car doesn't quite make sense, and the post-apocalyptic future hasn't been very rigorously imagined. Still, Michôd certainly delivers some brain-frazzling heat and&nbsp;directionless&nbsp;despair.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/08/guy-pearce-the-rover\" title=\"\">Interview: Guy Pearce</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/the-rover-film-review-rrobert-pattinson\" title=\"\">First-look review: The Rover</a></p>","headline":"The Rover review – Ozbilly shaggy dog story loses its way","trailText":"<p>Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson star in a brain frazzling post-apocalyptic outback tale of freaks and ferals, writes Peter Bradshaw</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407945835369/The-Rover---2014-004.jpg","wordcount":"319","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-13T16:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/14/rover-review-guy-pearce-robert-pattinson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/14/rover-review-guy-pearce-robert-pattinson","tags":[{"id":"film/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/australia","references":[]},{"id":"film/robert-pattinson","webTitle":"Robert Pattinson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/robert-pattinson","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterbradshaw","webTitle":"Peter Bradshaw","rcsId":"GNL378000","r2ContributorId":"16262","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749338256/PeterBradshaw.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian's film critic.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbradshaw","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/peterbradshaw","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-444588939","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407945835369/The-Rover---2014-004.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","source":"c.A24/Everett/REX","photographer":"c.A24/Everett/REX","altText":"The Rover - 2014","suppliersReference":"3808868f","height":"84","credit":"c.A24/Everett/REX/c.A24/Everett/REX","caption":"Bit of a muddle … Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson in The Rover.

made his name as teenage vampire heart-throb Edward Cullen in Twilight.

He talks about his new role in David Michôd’s dystopian outback western The Rover <br></p><p><br>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-rover\">More on The Rover</a><br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>There is a moment in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-rover\">The Rover</a>, David Michôd’s futuristic western set in the Australian outback, in which Robert Pattinson’s character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play Keri Hilson’s hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtXOVKNazYU\">Pretty Girl Rock</a>. The night is black and the radio tinny, and softly Pattinson begins to sing along. “Don’t hate me ’cause I’m beautiful,” he sings, his voice high and whiny, the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth. “Don’t hate me ‘cause I’m beautiful.”</p><p>It’s a pivotal moment for Rey, the slow, needy, uncertain young man Pattinson plays, but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself; a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the pretty-boy Hollywood pin-up.</p><p>The Pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick, pointing out, two steps into the room, that the hotel carpet “looks like a Magic Eye picture”. And indeed it does – a bold, blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black. But Pattinson’s remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself, as if he is weary of being the centre of it, the face that everyone stares at.</p><p>Pattinson was 22 when he was first cast as Edward Cullen in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/twilight\">the Twilight Saga</a>, the five-part movie adaptation of Stephanie Meyer’s best-selling teen vampire novels. Overnight he became one of Hollywood’s most adored young stars, pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans. He was named “the most handsome man in the world” by Vanity Fair, and one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time. Amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his co-star, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-stewart\">Kristen Stewart</a>, that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jan/29/the-rover-trailer-robert-pattinson-guy-pearce\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2034901\"                data-video-name=\"The Rover: exclusive trailer for Robert Pattinson's new film\"                data-video-provider=\"A24 Films\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/1/29/1391018325224/Robert-Pattinson-and-Guy--017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-428397631\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/1/29/1391018303615/Robert-Pattinson-and-Guy--007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/29/140129Rover-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/29//140129Rover.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/29/140129Rover/140129Rover.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/29/140129Rover_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/29/140129Rover_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>He is 28 now. The final Twilight instalment done, the Stewart romance finished, he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor.</p><p>Early leading-man roles (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135254/remember-me\">Remember Me</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141589/water-for-elephants\">Water for Elephants</a>) have given way to more challenging characters – he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in David Cronenberg’s adaptation of Don DeLillo’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/cosmopolis\">Cosmopolis</a>, and will soon be seen in another Cronenberg project, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/maps-to-the-stars\">Maps to the Stars</a> – as well as starring alongside Nicole Kidman in the Gertrude Bell biopic <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837636/\">Queen of the Desert</a>.</p><p>But for now he is rooted in Michôd’s The Rover, a brilliantly dark story of a loner (Guy Pearce) in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car. En route, he acquires Rey (Pattinson), the brother of one of the thieves, whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery, and together they chug through the Australian desert, now a glowering, lawless land 10 years after a global economic collapse.</p><p>“I just thought it was strikingly original,” Pattinson says of first reading Michôd’s script. “Even in the way it looked on the page.</p><p>“David’s got a very specific way of writing dialogue. It’s very functional, the writing’s very harsh, it’s savage, but it didn’t feel just stylised writing – it was emotional as well. It just seemed so natural compared to something like No Country for Old Men. I always felt that was more like film writing. And this didn’t really feel like a film script – it felt like a dream.”</p><p>Pattinson has a very particular way of speaking: he will talk softly, intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him – Michôd’s writing, for instance, or the craft of acting – only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing “It was crazy!” or a burst of wheezy, slightly wild laughter. It gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin.</p><p>He had to audition for The Rover – a process he loathes. “I’m quite good at doing meetings,” he says. “If I’m just meeting someone about a job I’m like a dog, especially if my agent’s said to me: ‘A lot of people want this job.’ Then I’m like: ‘Oh yeah? Then I will do anything to get it!’” What’s his technique? “I don’t know, I just become a bullshit artist!” he laughs. “That’s when I start acting! I’m really much better at doing it when the cameras aren’t rolling …”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ef38763f-fc61-4764-ba35-97fd64843134\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/14/1408031086521/8eff54e7-4503-45d6-8c50-f42550bd0442-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Robery Pattinson Twilight\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Pattinson, with Kristen Stewart in The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Photograph: c.Everett Collection / Rex Features/drama</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But auditions petrify him. He has spoken of the good 45 minutes of “neuroses” he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin. “I just can’t … I literally can’t do it,” he tries to explain. “It’s just me looking uncomfortable, trying to put on an American accent … or sitting in the corner, making myself throw up and punching myself in the face.” What helps get him past the neuroses, what happens after those excruciating 45 minutes that helps him perform. “Just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something,” he says. “That makes me sound like such an idiot. It’s crazy.”</p><p>But the joys of acting still outweigh these moments.</p><p>“For whatever reason, I think there’s something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something you’ve done afterwards, or to just do a scene and feel like: ‘Oh, I just had an out-of-body experience for a second!’”</p><p>He pauses. “Just for one second,” he says gently. “And generally people don’t even notice. It feels literally like you’ve been asleep for a second.” He recalls such a moment while shooting this film. “It’s not the biggest scene, it’s not even in the movie, it was the rehearsal. And me and Guy had just been going so nuts – we’d been out in the desert and we’d become like crazy homeless people. And I turned around and looked at him and just realised actually, we’re not acting any more.” He laughs. “And why did that feel so good? It’s so weird.”</p><p>It’s easy to assume that being tethered to the long-running Twilight Saga held him back from experiencing such moments, from growing as an actor, but he argues that the role required more resources than most. “I think Twilight’s probably the hardest part I’ve done,” he says, “because to do it for five movies, it’s really hard to think of stuff that’s maybe not boring. Especially if you don’t die. Because what’s the drama? You’re not scared of anything! And that’s the whole essence of drama: life and death.”</p><p>Pattinson was born and raised in London, but many of his film roles have required an US accent. In The Rover, Rey is from the American South, and like many has relocated to Australia in search of work in the mines. It was the voice, he says, that led him into the character.</p><p>He recalls “losing my mind” during his first day on set. “It just didn’t feel right for ages,” he says. “And then there was this one little thing – I had this makeup on my teeth, and it kept rubbing off all the time. It was really putting me off – it meant I had to keep redoing scenes. So I started trying to do this thing where I covered my teeth with my lips. And it changes your voice a little bit, but I thought: ‘Oh, that’s really cool!’ And after that I started speaking like that ‘ouhhggghhh …’” he replicates the style, and then laughs. “It’s so silly, it’s so stupid! I was just kind of making the accent up, I don’t even know what state it is really.”</p><p>But for Pattinson, having the opportunity to play a grubby-toothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the American South proved liberating, as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of Pearce. “There’s something about Rey, and there’s something about not having to drive the story forward,” he explains. “You can just be the condiment. It’s really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo.”</p><p>He is full of praise for Pearce, for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role. He speaks of how, for much of their time on set, he thought Pearce to be physically bigger, and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only clean-shaven but also somehow reduced in stature.</p><p>“And I liked seeing that Guy, even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared,” he adds. “I’ve worked with some actors who, having done so many movies, they just know what they’re gonna do. No matter what I would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it, whereas Guy is really trying to find it still. So that was why it was more fun – because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started. But he’s not afraid to let it happen. And there’s very few actors who’ve been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that, that still have that element of danger.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c6129037-6c50-4c48-822e-a6597d32e122\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/14/1408031232758/97e5bfc9-1fc6-446b-9ec5-914770896a4c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Robert Pattinson portrait\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>“Very few actors still have an element of danger,” says Pattinson. Photograph: Lee Calder/ Lee Calder/Corbis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>How did they find out what the movie was about? “I think it’s about the feel,” Pattinson says. “I think after I did Cosmopolis I realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it … well, it only really started with actors in the 50s, and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument …” he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh. “So I generally think whatever feels nice, it’s probably right.”</p><p>What felt nice in this role was the language, he says. “It was all the little speech patterns. It was like a song — if you’re singing a song in a certain way you’re not trying to make it sound sad or something, it just is.” He frowns. “I keep trying to do that in movies, but it’s really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it, that mean you don’t have to hit specific thematic beats.”</p><p>Occasionally he tries to write something himself. “I was trying to write a play the other day and I showed it to my assistant and didn’t quite realise how bad it was.” He laughs and laughs. “I was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking: ‘This is how you do it! You just stay up all night and keep writing!’ She came in the next morning, and I’d been up all night writing. I said to her: ‘You have to read this! It’s amazing!’” He could tell it was perhaps not, he says, from her facial expressions as she read. “And then she said: ‘It’s not in English … and half the time you haven’t even put the character names in so it’s just a stream of consciousness …’”</p><p>But he would like to be in a play, he says. “Something in a really small theatre. I don’t think I could do something on Broadway … But I’d quite like to do something kind of shocking.”</p><p>He likes being shocking, he says, and his next role is satisfyingly so. Starring alongside Robert De Niro in Olivier Assayas’s <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/05/robert-de-niro-robert-pattinson-idols-eye-736446/\">Idol’s Eye</a>, he will play a small-time criminal caught up with the Chicago mafia. “My character is this slightly delusional lost child,” he says. “Everyone always glamorises criminals – it feels inevitable in movies – but in this it’s really not glamorised. It is quite dense. It’s really serious. Very political.”</p><p>I think of something he told me earlier, about the ways in which he believes Twilight has influenced his career, and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen. I pictured his frustration, the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role, but on the contrary, he explained, he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings.</p><p>“It’s kind of fun,” he said. “Because people have preconceived ideas about you, and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more.”</p>","headline":"Robert Pattinson: ‘Twilight's the hardest part I've done'","trailText":"He made his name as a teenage vampire in Twilight before his turbulent romance with co‑star Kristen Stewart dominated the world’s gossip columns.

My Song director Peter Chelsom has mistaken blokish fantasy for happiness in this draggy travelogue","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>A naggingly credulous adaptation of François Lelord's philosophically minded bestseller, with Simon Pegg as a psychiatrist using a round-the-world jolly as a means of jolting himself from cardiganned mid-life stasis. Erstwhile crowdpleaser Peter Chelsom (Hear My Song) still knows how to frame a&nbsp;good gag, but precious few emerge in a draggy travelogue that, astonishingly, feels scarcely more substantial than Eat Pray Love.

Sheffield Wednesday got to the final of the FA and the Coca Cola Cups (albeit to be pipped to the post by Arsenal on both occasions), Meatloaf’s I Would Do Anything For Love got to number one, and Tarantino’s True Romance came out.</p><p>At the age of eight, however, I was too busy having a crush on Chris Waddle and perusing JD Sports’ shinpad selection down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/09/sheffield-meadowhall-shopping-centre-for-sale\">Meadowhall</a> to even think about trying to slip into the local cinema to see this Tony Scott-directed classic; sweet and dark in almost equal measure. It was only later that, watching this bubble gum chewing, Snapple-drinking, metallic turquoise Rayban-wearing incarnation of Patricia Arquette, I was struck dumb. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8-Vxm7DBbk\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8-Vxm7DBbk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Alabama Whitman’s been a call girl for “exactly 4 days” before she’s paid to bump into comic store assistant Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) as he partakes in his annual birthday Sonny Chiba triple feature – Street Fighter, Return of the Street Fighter and Sister Street Fighter – alone. They fall for one another instantly and crashingly and, in a scene that on the more hungover of days I could happily watch on repeat, Alabama professes her romantic ethic like it were a mantra: “when it comes to relationships I’m 100%… I’m 100%… monogamous. If I’m with you, then I’m with you, and I don’t want to be with anybody else.”</p><p>It wasn’t just that Alabama Whitman was able to pull off cowboy boots, cow print mini skirts, pink and blue leopard print leggings, off-the-shoulder blouses and neon bras, often simultaneously; though that no doubt helped. (Plus inspired some ill-advised attempts at mimicry – one bid to dress as Alabama at a 90s-themed house party ended with me claiming I’d intentionally gone for a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101050/\">Blossom</a>/Alabama hybrid look to cover the shame).</p><p>It was also that Alabama’s badass, and, crucially, lovely too. She does what her namesake poet advices and “<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/39/45.html\">stands up for the stupid and crazy</a>.” So dogged is she that, in a wincingly violent fight scene, even the man who was later to become Tony Soprano concedes, “you’ve got a lot of heart, kid”. She giggles her way through crisis and – with her poetic monologues that bookend the film in a Badlands homage – she manages somehow to rise above the bloodbath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYE-qg4RBO0\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYE-qg4RBO0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In her honeysuckle southern drawl, spoken to the chime of the Carl Orff/Hans Zimmer theme, she talks of her clarity of thought: “Amid the chaos of that day, when all I could hear was the thunder of gunshots, and all I could smell was the violence in the air, I look back and am amazed that my thoughts were so clear and true, that three words went through my mind endlessly… you’re so cool, you’re so cool, you’re so cool.” </p><p>Clarence might be cool, but Alabama’s no second best. As things unravel in grand Tarantino style – cocaine’s stolen, guns are cocked and blood’s spilt in rivers – Alabama is the sugar-y glue keeping things from becoming irrevocably unstuck. </p>","headline":"Why I'd like to be … Patricia Arquette in True Romance","trailText":"In the final part of our series in which Guardian writers nominate their cinematic heroes, Ellie Violet Bramley raises a Snapple to Alabama Whitman, the lovely badass who rises above the violence of Tony Scott’s True Romance","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408110800930/a8013d57-3775-49ef-9195-8e14919fde5b-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"497","commentable":"true","byline":"Ellie Violet Bramley","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-18T14:36:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/15/why-id-like-to-be-alabama-whitman-in-true-romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/15/why-id-like-to-be-alabama-whitman-in-true-romance","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/role-model","webTitle":"Role model","description":"Writers on which movie characters they emulated growing up - or they still model themselves on today","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/role-model","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/quentintarantino","webTitle":"Quentin Tarantino","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/quentintarantino","references":[]},{"id":"film/tony-scott","webTitle":"Tony Scott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tony-scott","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/tony-scott","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ellie-violet-bramley","webTitle":"Ellie Violet Bramley","r2ContributorId":"60379","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ellie writes on culture, social justice and, all too often, Point Break.

There's eye candy (a lot), brain  food (a bit), an ass-whupping antiheroine (an abundance thereof), and an 89-minute running time  that means you can still fit in a Jamie's Italian before bedtime. In other words, it's a welcome return to the Luc Besson of the 1990s.</p><p>Playing on the old myth that we use only 10% of our brains, Scarlett Johansson is the partying student and reluctant drug mule who becomes an action hero, then superhero, as the narcotics involuntarily stuffed in her stomach seep into her bloodstream, that 10% rising rapidly to 100%. The film hurtles along as her brain goes full-throttle. The drug, says Besson, is inspired by \"a molecule that pregnant women create after six weeks – a super atomic bomb for a baby\". He knows the 10% brain capacity theory is hokum. \"What's true, though, is that we only use 15% of our neurons at the same time,\" he says. \"But it's never the same 15%. So we can ask ourselves, what happens to us if we can suddenly have 30%, 40%, 50% of our neurons working at the same time? I changed the reality a little to help the story.\"</p><p>As a director Besson has had an iffy 21st century, and Lucy, while not his best, is a good reminder of why he made such an impact in the first place. 1988's The Big Blue was a plaintive, pretty paean to his love of deep-sea diving, but 1990's Nikita introduced Besson as a turbo-charged action director: with Anne Parillaud as a murderer-turned-spy, it boasted a no-nonsense female shit-kicker a year before James Cameron brought us Terminator 2. Besson went bigger and better with Léon, giving Natalie Portman her first role as a 12-year-old apprentice assassin in love with a taciturn middle-aged hitman; then he went huge with The Fifth Element, an arty, bonkers sci-fi featuring an arty, bonkers alien (Milla Jovovich). The French critical consensus was that he was a crass sell-out in thrall to Hollywood; Hollywood welcomed him with open arms.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444629957'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407944028941/Lucy-2014-011.jpg' alt='Lucy 2014' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Scarlett Johansson in Luc Besson's Lucy. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX</figcaption></figure><p>Tonally, Lucy is Besson in a blender, with shades of both The Fifth Element's sense of desperation and wonder, and the gung-ho, wham-bam spirit of the Taken/Transporter/Taxi films he's spent the last few years writing and producing. Not that he agrees. \"When I make a film I'm not even thinking about anything else,\" he says. \"Lucy is the first time I've taken a character who is totally normal at the beginning of the film. She's Miss Nobody. She's studying, she's partying too much, she doesn't know what to do with her life; a totally average girl. Most of the time I start with amazing people, like Aung San Suu Kyi [in The Lady], or [Fifth Element's] Leeloo. So for me, she is totally different from anything I've done.\"</p><p>Lucy puts every man in the film in the shade by several degrees. It's a Besson motif: the scripts he writes for others may be testosterone-heavy but the majority of those he keeps for himself feature headstrong female leads. Again, he dismisses the idea: \"When I started to think about Lucy nine years ago, I knew the film would be for me, but I didn't know the protagonist would be female. It's more than whether it's a female. If I think another director could miss the point, I don't want to give it away.\"</p><p>He's certainly happy to give away his brawnier ideas. His Jason Statham/Liam Neeson vehicles – less idiosyncratic and less conceptual than the films he directs – have proved lucrative for his company, EuropaCorp. Those are Besson's franchises, and onwards those juggernauts roll. The Transporter is currently being rebooted, while the third Taken film wraps two days before we speak. He initially said that Taken would be a one-off. After the sequel, he said, OK, really this time, that's it. Money, presumably, changes his mind: the first film cost $25m and made $227m, while the second made $376m.</p><p>Business aside, these movies clearly work. The Taken films hit home, says Besson, because they play on parents' fears for their kids and, at the same time, provide wish-fulfilment. \"Every dad dreams about being Bryan Mills, and every daughter dreams of having Bryan Mills as a dad,\" he says, and he justifies milking the conceit. \"After the first one, I couldn't see how we could do a sequel. We decided to do a continuation of the first one. The first one the girl is taken, the second one they take vengeance. It's one story. The third one is an original. It's the same family, but nobody is taken. The dog is not taken.\"</p><p>One assumes money is a big factor in the films he doesn't direct, but he's more protective over those he does. He refuses to follow up The Fifth Element, and, thankfully, hasn't given in to those demanding a Léon sequel. \"You can't imagine how many people ask me for a Léon sequel,\" he says. \"Everywhere I go they ask me. If I was motivated by money I would have done it a long time ago. But I don't feel it.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444629958'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407944385309/Leon-1994-009.jpg' alt='Leon 1994' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The hitman and her: Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in Léon. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/BUENA VISTA</figcaption></figure><p>The longer we talk, the deeper Besson is keen  to get, assuring me the appeal of Lucy as a project was philosophical. \"What's interesting is the definition of humanity,\" he says. \"Watch the news tonight. When you see the state of humanity today…  I mean, come on, it's a mess.\" Lucy's message, he says, is that when you have power, the best thing to do is to share it. When I ask what sort of films he's burning to make, he says how much he values the purity of children over adult cynicism, and would like to do something with that.</p><p>People tell him, he says, that he's a big kid himself, and his parents' divorce, when he was 10 years old, has influenced his career. \"Here is two families,\" he once told the New York Times, \"and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn't work. And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here.\"</p><p>Does he still feel that rage?</p><p>\"No, I don't have it any more,\" he says, confessing that film-making is therapeutic.</p><p>\"You have a suitcase full  of souvenirs and trauma, and when you're young your suitcase is always open. When you become an adult you learn how to close it, and to open it when you need it. And that's what I learned. So I always have my suitcase, with all my scars. But I can live with it.

Can you think of any other clips to add to the list? Let us know in the comment thread below.</p><h2>1) Donkey from Shrek</h2><p>Eddie Murphy had already served his apprenticeship the fast-talking animated comic foil role as a dragon with size issues <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn_nM7x7Lcw\">in Disney’s Mulan</a> (“certainly to my mind his third best film” - Mike from Spaced).

Like that it was slightly unnerving, weird but ultimately worthwhile. Testing tube lines by using the Myers-Briggs metric is a great idea (the Circle line is ESTP Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perception, for example), taking the piss out of John Major’s privatisation policy is also ace, and Ed’s general plummy but endearing persona is far more ingratiating that some precocious squirt on TED telling me about how they’ve achieved more than I ever will in their 13 years. Genuinely enjoyed that.

Things were so much simpler back in the day. You had your hair metal poseurs and your paunchy NWOBHMers, and both had the bejaysus scared out of them by thrash. Unfortunately, now that Kerry Katona would wear a Napalm Death T-shirt on Loose Women and Slipknot are invited to sniff dead crows and spew over one another on the CBeebies panto (possibly), metal has got lost in interminable sub-genres, pointy logos, and a race to the antisocial bottom – Cancerous Womb, anyone? To their credit, Southport’s Sa-da-kO are comparitively low on cliche. Though their singer does that death metal grunt that sounds like an old man with a bad back coughing up phlegm, some lyrics are discernible (“I am everything you despise”), and even – the sellouts! – a chorus. Plus this video, by independent film-makers Mycho, is a minor body horror classic. Your milkman may never whistle Filth Licker while doing his rounds, but should he turn his hands to some light dismemberment, it might fit the bill. <em>MH</em></p><h2>Rob Manuel - I’m Going To Write A Concept Album With Luke Haines</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rob Manuel\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guideguardian&quot;&gt;@guideguardian&lt;/a&gt; please review my song &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to write a concept album with Luke Haines&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VHkzhGZB1F&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VHkzhGZB1F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rob Manuel (@robmanuel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robmanuel/statuses/500243154889871360&quot;&gt;August 15, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>REVIEWED:</strong> Exactly what you will get from the song I’m Going To Write A Concept Album With Luke Haines depends on what you know of Haines himself: former gruppenführer of The Auteurs, scourge of Britpop, acid tongue, these days fixated on concept albums about psychedelic wrestlers and rock’n’roll animals, no fan of The Guardian if his tweets are much to go by (hi Luke!). Rob Manuel is clearly a fan, as his ode to collaboration is what we might call Hainesian in tone: equal parts acerbic and whimsical, more reference-packed than a Stuart Maconie anecdote (“Buy a book about Lord Lucan from a charity shop/Dream he fronted Hawkwind and played Top of the Pops”) and not in fact all that different from the curious song-tributes that Haines sings on albums like New York On The 70s. Main problem is that Rob sings a bit crap and plays a bit crap, meaning his projected audience is probably just a fraction of that of Luke Haines, which as he notes within the song, is fairly select in the first place. Meanwhile, if you have no idea who the hell Luke Haines is, a) Why are you still reading? and b) There is nothing for you here. <em>LP</em></p><h2>A picture of JLS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"JLS\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guideguardian&quot;&gt;@guideguardian&lt;/a&gt; please review my drawing of pop band JLS.

I’m not quite sure who Marvin has been replaced with, but he looks a bit like a fat cat politician who’s infected his new bandmates with white-eyed cynicism. Which leads me to wonder what exactly the artist is trying to say about the beloved R&amp;B foursome. That underneath their fedoras, waxed chests and superfluous scarfs, Aston and co are no different from the suits whose duck houses a helpless public are forced to fund? Or maybe this is simply a cheap dig at Marvin, who, it has to be said, was approaching the geriatric end of the popstar spectrum. At 29, he may as well be 106 as far as the cruel world of reality show-assembled pop is concerned. <em>RA</em></p><h2>Strange Planes - EP One </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Strange Planes\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katehutchinson&quot;&gt;@katehutchinson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guideguardian&quot;&gt;@guideguardian&lt;/a&gt; hi kate!x &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/C49uAuMnRk&quot;&gt;http://t.co/C49uAuMnRk&lt;/a&gt; any chance?xx&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ellis Slater (@fresh_pipes) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fresh_pipes/statuses/500253644118568960&quot;&gt;August 15, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>REVIEWED:</strong> I’m a busy man with many important things making demands on my time (it’s fish and chips day in the canteen and all the best bits of fish always go early), so for the sake of full disclosure I admit I only listened to the first tune on this EP. It was called Sharpen Your Teeth, so it already bags a clutch of cheeky bonus points for having a brilliant name, because critical journalism really is that superficial. The tune itself’s not bad either - flabby power chords thud back and forth like a jogging elephant’s knackers and the vocals kick up the slightest whiff of Green Day, making Sharpen Your Teeth sound a little bit like how the stoner-pop-punks might have sounded if Billie Joe Armstrong had ever stopped masturbating for long enough to find out what a minor chord was. It even dips a cautious toe into My Chemical Romance territory towards the end - no bad thing, as a bit of epic bombast is fine when employed as a seasoning rather than a cricket bat across the kneecaps. All in all, this is three and a half minutes of extremely listenable power-pop, and after I’ve had my fish and chips I fully intend to slip on my veterinary gloves and go elbow-deep into the rest of the EP. <em>LH</em><br></p><h2>Plankton Dada Wave - Haus Of Dada</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Plankton Dada Wave\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guideguardian&quot;&gt;@guideguardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/reviewanything?src=hash&quot;&gt;#reviewanything&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;#39;s our new ep, weird-post-punk from italy: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/L1C3dGbRJn&quot;&gt;http://t.co/L1C3dGbRJn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PlanktonDadaWave (@PlanktonDadaWav) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PlanktonDadaWav/statuses/498568433068679168&quot;&gt;August 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>REVIEWED:</strong> Whoa, I’m transported to the days when I used to go to Club Artrocker on a Tuesday night at the Buffalo Bar in London and tremble and convulse like an electrocuted Jarvis to eight different time signatures in one song. Post-punk – and its song titles that no one can spell – like this refuses to die and will continue to be angular fodder for people with guitars until only the cockroaches and the mould in my bathroom is left alive. Luckily, Haus Of Dada have eccentrified it to the max with their cartoonish Italian accents (check out Mucho Mas) and cosmic whooshes. If Robert Rodriguez made movies set in Rome and not Texas, you imagine this sort of thing might make his soundtracks. <em>KH</em></p>","headline":"#ReviewAnything - from drawings to tunes, we rate your creative handiwork","trailText":"Every Friday we pledge to review whatever you’ve sent us over the past seven days, with absolutely no restrictions.
