intelligence agency has warned of potential violence around the release of Kaum De Heere, a Punjabi film which portrays the assassination of India’s former prime minister Indira Gandhi.</p> <p>The film tells the story of her assassins, Sikh bodyguards who turned against Gandhi following Operation Blue Star, a military operation to quell revolution in Amritsar in 1984 which left hundreds of Sikhs dead. One of the bodyguards, Beant Singh, was killed by police shortly after, while the other, Satwant Singh, was later hanged.</p> <p>Director Ravinder Ravi claims that the film is not biased, and that it merely tells the story as drawn from the trial of Kehar Singh, one of the plotters, as well as the confessions of the assassins themselves. “Allegations that we want to create a law and order problem by showing what happened 30 years ago are meaningless,” Ravi <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Protests-planned-against-film-on-Indiras-killers/articleshow/40385650.cms\">told the Times of India</a>. “We are just reproducing what has been documented. What’s wrong in bringing historical incidents before the public after 30 years?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW6OGUzEmJM\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WW6OGUzEmJM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Protests are nevertheless being planned by the Punjab Youth Congress, a youth political organisation who claim the film glorifies the assassins. “The movie not only justifies the killing of the former PM, but is also an attempt to revive terrorism in Punjab,” said congress president Vikramjit Singh Chaudhary. “We hope the [current] PM [Narendra Modi] will intervene in the issue. Otherwise, we would not allow the film to be released in Punjab ... the government shall be responsible for any law and order issue that may crop up.”</p> <p>The son of one of the killers, Sarabjit Singh Khalsa, has championed the film, saying: “The movie brings to fore the pain which Indira’s bodyguards felt during their visit to the Golden Temple after Operation Blue Star.” </p> <p>The chief minister of the Punjab, Parkash Singh Badal, <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/controversial-punjabi-film-badal-asks-home-secretary-to-look-into-it/article1-1253409.aspx\">has said</a> that he would ask India’s home secretary to look into the situation.

It is not just that this chimerical parable of the New York streets has taken the box office by storm, like some upmarket Death Wish (though that in itself means something in view of the apparent failure of Mean Streets). Nor is it that the film is some imperishable masterpiece to be approached on bended knee by critics. Its real power lies in the urgency with which it is made.</p> <p>It is, like Nashville, a tour de force which doesn’t so much explain America as reflect part of it with unerring accuracy. You may not like what you see, but you can’t stop it hitting you between the eyes.</p> <p>Scorsese’s protagonist, brilliantly played by Robert De Niro, is the archetypal alienated man - almost a figure out of Dostoevsky. A semi-literate Vietnam veteran, he lives in a dingy apartment, watches a lot of television, writes a strained and enigmatic diary, pops pills and, because he can’t sleep, takes a night job as a down-town cabbie. What he sees on his rounds would convince a saint that hell is, in fact, on earth. Pimps, whores, muggers and addicts line the desperate sidewalks and his customers include a psychotic who watches his wife making love to a Negro while telling the cabbie how he’s going to fire a pistol into her “pussy.” And for after hours diversion, there are the 42nd Street skin flicks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Taxi Driver\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"270\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/cujiHDeqnHY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Have this man spurned by first a self-assured blonde (Cybill Shepherd) who seems a vision of purity as she idealistically campaigns for a Mr Clean Politician, and then by a fathomless teenage whore (Jodie Foster) in no need of his rescue operation, and the abyss yawns. He dons battle uniform, shaves his head like a Mohawk Indian and takes to the streets bent on vengeance. His job completed in a bloodbath of singular horror, he not only exorcises his rage but is hailed as a hero in the papers.</p> <p>As some kind of allegory directly relating to the American experience it suffices, though only just, in the same way as Altman’s cathartic ending sufficed for Nashville. But its proper value lies not in the schematic nature of Paul Schrader’s script - the way the story rounds itself off - but in the terrifyingly fluent portrait of unease, frustration and corruption that is up there on the screen.</p> <p>The film isn’t at all a piece of realism, or operatically handled neo-realism. It operates first and foremost on an imaginative level, and that does not exclude the surreal. That first image of the steam from a manhole in a street isn’t there by accident. It is a vision which exactly corresponds to the nightmare we are about to see.</p> <p>Bernard Herrmann’s score, the last he wrote before he died, supports the imagery notably well and it is difficult to imagine better performances than those from De Niro, Shepherd, Foster, Harvey Keitel (the pimp) and Peter Bole (a fellow cabbie). De Niro is compulsively watchable throughout but, even so, it is Scorsese’s picture. Perhaps only a New Yorker could have made it. Perhaps anyway the time was ripe. Even so, this is a wholly remarkable film, flaws and all. In fact, even the flaws are significant.</p>","headline":"From the archive, 19 August 1976: Martin Scorsese's remarkable Taxi Driver","trailText":"<strong>Originally published in the Guardian on 19 August 1976: </strong>Gritty snapshot of New York City’s seedier side and Robert DeNiro’s performance make Taxi Driver a cinematic tour de force","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408360442408/e7e2aa9e-24b2-452f-82c7-8b57d196b684-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"570","commentable":"true","byline":"Derek Malcolm","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-22T06:00:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/19/scorsese-de-niro-taxi-driver-review-archive-1976","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/19/scorsese-de-niro-taxi-driver-review-archive-1976","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/from-the-archive","webTitle":"From the Guardian archive","description":"Historic articles from the Guardian archive, compiled by the Guardian research and information department (follow us on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardianlibrary\">@guardianlibrary</a>).

Recorded live at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/04/bjork-biophilia-review\">London’s Alexandra Palace in 2013</a>, the concert featured dizzying visuals, an Icelandic choir, and a truly top notch wig.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvLZl1HlW3Y\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvLZl1HlW3Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>I was at the concert, and though Bj&ouml;rk showed her routine brilliance, I’m not sure if the resulting film will be able to match the majesty of her performance recorded at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3tc8_8Dgd4\">the Royal Opera House in 2001</a>, or her show at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZoAW3VfWw\">London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire</a> in 1997, filmed amid her Homogenic-era pomp.</p> <p>We asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianmusic\">@guardianmusic</a> followers to chose their greatest ever music films. Here are some of the suggestions - add your own in the open thread below.</p> <h2>1) Stop Making Sense - Talking Heads (1984)<br /></h2> <p>An all-time classic, by far the most popular suggestion with our followers. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/casparllewellynsmith\">Caspar Llewellyn Smith</a> wrote for the Observer in 2007: “The beauty of Stop Making Sense is that, unusually, the camera lingered on the musicians in the act of performance, with no close-ups of guitar solos or other such fripperies. Rather than being lost as an artefact of its time, the film remains as fresh as ever, even if that famous suit has long since gone out of fashion.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_2O3EurDQ\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UD_2O3EurDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VictorRotulador/statuses/501308625324085248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianmusic\">@guardianmusic</a> Simple, Stop Making Sense by Talking Heads.

It’s also a reminder that Jonny Greenwood is a hugely inventive guitarist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDYplfRqg0o\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDYplfRqg0o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>4) The Band - The Last Waltz (1978)</h2> <p>Filmed by Martin Scorsese, The Band’s 16 years on the road ended with this valedictory concert, with special guest stars aplenty - among them, Bob Dylan (inevitably), Joni Mitchell, Dr John, Neil Young and Eric Clapton.

A sterling box-office run and two consecutive number 1 weekends that will do no harm in marketing the movie across DVD and digital platforms bode well. Last weekend's opening numbers were very strong indeed, and the Turtles followed up with a solid $28.4m in the second weekend after a 57% box office fall. That the movie cost $125m will be of concern, because there is still a way to go before it recoups. Distributors take roughly half of theatrical box office (the balance goes to the cinema chains) and then there are marketing costs to deduct. For a tentpole summer release with global reach, those costs are expected to be at least $50m, possibly considerably more. So the theatrical performance is crucial to drive interest in the ancillary markets, and this has been a very promising start. By comparison, Warner Bros' 2007 release TMNT finished on $54m.</p><h2>The Expendables 3 limps into action</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-444474167\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3/140813Expendables3.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />The boys-with-toys action release delivered the feeblest debut of the franchise, on an estimated $16.2m through Lionsgate that secured fifth place in the charts.

The Expendables 3 has every chance of succeeding internationally, of course, because audiences in less mature markets still put most things Hollywood on a pedestal. The action sequel debuted in approximately 39 territories at the weekend and we may not get those results until Monday or Tuesday.<br /></p><h2>The Giver doesn't give back</h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uxFJvlWqphM\">Reading on mobile? Click here</a><br />Harvey Weinstein's YA (young adult) adaptation, based on the revered schoolchild staple by Lois Lowry, opened at number five on $12.8m, which cannot have pleased the studios' combustible chief. After a heavy promotional push at the recent Comic-Con in San Diego and plenty of advertising spots, the movie arrived with something of a whimper. Reviews were generally poor and maybe audience ennui is setting in with the blizzard of YA movies. It's hard to tell if that is good or bad for Fox's upcoming release The Maze Runner, which is packed with virile young talent, many of them unknown, and lacks the star power of The Giver. The Weinstein movie stars Brenton Thwaites from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/maleficent-review-angelina-jolie-sleeping-beauty-horns-vinegar\" title=\"\">Maleficent</a>, alongside Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes and Alexander Skaarsgard. Heck, it even features a cameo by Taylor Swift. The Maze Runner opens on 19 September. The Giver looks likely to exit the top 10 within several weeks.</p><h2>Boyhood bounces back – again</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-441840743\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood/140711TGFSBoyhood.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />Richard Linklater's beloved coming-of-age drama is like a slo-mo yo-yo, popping in and out of the top 10 but never straying too far. In its sixth session IFC boosted the theatre-count from 506 to 771. That helped the movie surge three places to number 10 and add $2.2m for $13.8m. This is a spectacular result for a $4m production cost, given that IFC has not spent much on marketing. That's no slight to the distributor; they tend not to shell out heavily in the promotional department, fully aware their movies are destined to play across digital platforms. They may need to revise that spending policy when awards season kicks in, because a lot of Hollywood insiders are expecting the movie to sparkle.</p><h2>The Trip to Italy</h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/55OtglvtXuI\">Reading on mobile? Click here</a><br />The prolific Michael Winterbottom returns with a rather needless but nonetheless entertaining comedy follow-up to The Trip. Those who saw it in the US adored The Trip, as they should, and there is a core following for Winterbottom's work,  too. The Trip to Italy arrived in three sites and grossed $71,6000 for an excellent $23,867 average. IFC is the distributor, as it was on The Trip, which finished on $2m back in 2011.</p><h2>North American top 10, August 15-17 2014</h2><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles\" title=\"\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, $28.4m.

appeared as a commentator on Fox News and even launched her own TV station. Now Sarah Palin has found a new role, that of film critic, with <a href=\"https://sarahpalinchannel.com/updates/a-moving-conservative-movie/\">a rousing review</a> of new movie The Giver in which she repositions the dystopian tale as an anti-Obama polemic.<br /><br />The sometime Tea Party darling and former Republican vice presidential candidate took to the airwaves of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sarahpalinchannel.com/\">sarahpalinchannel.com</a>&nbsp;to review Philip Noyce’s film, which posits a society based on the absence of race, emotions, money and social status. The movie, featuring Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgard, Taylor Swift and Katie Holmes among the supporting cast, was released in the US at the weekend and has received <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_giver/\">short shrift from critics</a>. But the film could now be set for a new lease of life among conservative filmgoers after Palin identified it as a scathing attack on big government which Ronald Reagan himself would have adored.<br /><br />“The Giver depicts a society where the government has grown well beyond an anti-state,” reveals the budding critic. “The government in the movie limits every aspect of life — where to live, what to wear, what to eat, who to marry — to make a society that doesn’t have pain or risk, supposedly, to create some kind of utopia. Sound familiar?”</p> <p>Warming to her theme, Palin adds: “This movie shows us exactly where we’re headed if we don’t inject into our culture a little courage, tenacity and rebellion against a government all too eager to take away our freedom. The funny thing about governments is, the bigger and more powerful they grow, the more they disrespect the lives of their citizens.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Palin also praises Streep for taking part in a movie that “so powerfully conveys truths about the way our culture is and the way it could be if we just had enough courage to fight back when we realise something is horribly wrong”. Blurb on Palin’s site also describes The Giver as offering “a positive pro-life and pro-liberty message”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-406d3582-862d-463e-8e10-c26e427326a3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408361279896/9ab026e3-c573-44fa-8658-b5378392e221-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meryl Streep, left, and Jeff Bridges in The Giver\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Meryl Streep, left, and Jeff Bridges in The Giver</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The commentator’s take on The Giver may come as something of a surprise to Noyce,<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/01/1038712828059.html http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/celebrities-political-affiliations-20122210/25633\"> a documented supporter of Gough Whitlam’s left-leaning Labor administration in 1970s Australia, and Streep, who has donated regularly to the US Democratic Party</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />So far Palin’s praise does not seem to have been all that helpful.

bus featured in the acclaimed Sean Penn drama Into the Wild had to be <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2014/08/15/hikers-rescued-amid-into-the-wild-bus-pilgrimage\">rescued by volunteers </a>after one of them fell ill.<br /><br />The three men&nbsp;were picked up by servicemen from the Tri-Valley volunteer fire department after one of them tripped and hurt himself with an axe. They had been trying to get to the rundown bus in the remote Alaskan wilderness, 180 miles north of Anchorage near the entrance to the Denali National Park and Preserve, for several days, but were put off by the height of water in the&nbsp;nearby Teklanika river.</p> <p>It seems the men, named as Matthew Peot, 29, Thomas Young, 45, and Kenneth Young, whose age was not given, narrowly escaped the fate suffered in 1992 by Chris McCandless, the real-life adventurer whose story was told in Into the Wild and the book upon which it was based.</p> <p>In Penn’s film <strong>(spoiler alert)</strong>, McCandless (Emile Hirsch) finds his way to the bus following a two-year journey of self-discovery but is soon trapped without food supplies by the rising waters of the Teklanika. Unable to contact the outside world, he turns to consumption of local flora in a desperate attempt to fend off starvation and dies after eating a poisonous plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8afdf999-79f2-4bf4-8e00-cf74f6b0fd5f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408353648716/389d369d-974f-421f-9f02-9a3c02760036-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hirsch in a still from Into The Wild.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Hirsch in a still from Into The Wild.

A Swiss woman drowned in the river four years ago, though it was not clear if she was heading for the bus or just hiking in the area.</p> <p>Penn’s 2007 film, based on the 1996 non-fiction book of the same name by Jon Krakauer, starred Jena Malone, Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt and Catherine Keener alongside Hirsch. &nbsp;It was nominated for two Oscars and received rapturous reviews from critics. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/seanpenn.drama\"> described the film</a> as “a serious, personal movie about what it is to be human, and what happens when we admire nature more than humanity”.<br /><br /></p>","headline":"Into the Wild hikers latest movie fans to require rescue","trailText":"Three men on a pilgrimage to find the bus featured in Sean Penn’s film helped to safety by volunteers","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408353491786/66ee4a5b-a7cb-419f-aacb-a0976186a4f6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"360","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-21T10:30:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/18/into-the-wild-hikers-latest-movie-fans-to-require-rescue","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/18/into-the-wild-hikers-latest-movie-fans-to-require-rescue","tags":[{"id":"film/seanpenn","webTitle":"Sean Penn","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/seanpenn","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"travel/walkingholidays","webTitle":"Walking holidays","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/walkingholidays","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/walkingholidays","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-1d4e4f8a-200a-46fa-8df5-ddf740909c7e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408353490985/66ee4a5b-a7cb-419f-aacb-a0976186a4f6-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408353490985/66ee4a5b-a7cb-419f-aacb-a0976186a4f6-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"Chuck Zlotnick","altText":"Penn and Hirsch on set of Into the Wild.","suppliersReference":"NY581","height":"132","credit":"Chuck Zlotnick/AP","caption":"Penn and Hirsch on set of Into the Wild.

Jaws wasn’t Steven Spielberg’s first film; it was his sixth, and M Night Shyamalan didn’t appear from nowhere as the director of The Sixth Sense; he’d helmed his second film – Christian kid flick Wide Awake, with Rosie O’Donnell as a nun – the year before. Such formative works were little known before IMDb became the de facto arbiter of pub arguments, but today they’re increasingly coming to light.<br /></p> <p>Back when Leonard Maltin’s books were the public’s only source of cinematic stats, film-makers were free to craft perfect resum&eacute;s for themselves, beginning with their first hit and ending with their last. Early efforts were thrown to the wind as officially sanctioned filmographies used only the cream of a broad and motley crop.</p> <p>Now, though, it seems no director is allowed to forget his or her roots. This summer alone, both Tim Burton and Lars von Trier have seen early directorial efforts come back to haunt them. The former’s bizarre, Japanese-influenced adaptation of Hansel And Gretel surfaced on YouTube last month, unseen since a lone Disney Channel airing in 1983. Burton is reportedly embarrassed by the film, but its pantomime grotesquery provides a fascinating backstory to his better-known work.</p> <p>Von Trier’s juvenilia is even stranger. The two-minute animated short The Trip to Squash Land: A Super-Sausage Adventure, made by an 11-year-old Lars in 1967, sees a group of rabbits go on an underwater journey with an anthropomorphised sausage. A title card at the conclusion of the film does recall von Trier’s later work, but only by accident – “Slut” being Danish for “The End”.</p> <p>These primitive films may interfere with an auteurist vision of every director as the master of their own domain, but they also shine a light on the evolution of an artist. After all, The Terminator is a great film – but it’s even better once you’ve seen Piranha II: The Spawning.</p>","headline":"Directorial early works available online now","trailText":"‘These primitive films may interfere with an auteurist vision of every director as the master of their own domain, but they also shine a light on the evolution of an artist’","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407941039791/452cd88a-00d1-4cf4-8c37-f461e9bfae58-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"327","commentable":"true","byline":"Charlie Lyne","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-21T09:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/18/directorial-early-works-available-online-now","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/18/directorial-early-works-available-online-now","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"media/online-tv","webTitle":"Online TV","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/online-tv","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/online-tv","references":[]},{"id":"film/lars-von-trier","webTitle":"Lars von Trier","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lars-von-trier","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/lars-von-trier","references":[]},{"id":"film/stevenspielberg","webTitle":"Steven Spielberg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stevenspielberg","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/stevenspielberg","references":[]},{"id":"film/jamescameron","webTitle":"James Cameron","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/jamescameron","references":[]},{"id":"film/timburton","webTitle":"Tim Burton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/timburton","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/timburton","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/digital-media","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/charlie-lyne","webTitle":"Charlie Lyne","r2ContributorId":"48628","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Charlie Lyne watches movies at home and writes about them for the Guide.

But Luc Besson takes his uberfemme too far","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>When Scarlett Johansson achieves total consciousness in Luc Besson's sublimely ridiculous <strong>Lucy</strong>, she does not quip, like Bill Murray when granted the same Zen privilege by the Dalai Lama in Caddyshack, \"So I got that going for me, which is nice.\"</p><p>Probably because it isn't nice at all. It's hard to figure out quite what Besson is saying about the fact that most of us only use 10% of our brain's cognitive powers, but what we see on screen is a woman who, accidentally poisoned with a massive dose of a consciousness-expanding pharmaceutical, becomes steadily less human with each incremental increase in awareness, more indefatigable, then utterly infallible, and eventually completely uninteresting.</p><p>It's the reverse of the process Johansson undergoes in the far more captivating Under The Skin, which was a highly stylised examination of what it is to become human. But who do you root for if your heroine simply can't be bested? Has she no Achilles Heel? What is her Kryptonite? Where is the underdog in this scenario?</p><p>The underdog is everyone else: the people she knocks out, shoots, stabs, or glues to the ceiling with her hypertrophied atomic mind. When it turns out later on that she can change her hair colour by sheer mind-power, grow webbing on her hands and even travel through time, you just have to surrender and enjoy the ride.</p><p>Somewhere in this artificially flavoured, toxically calorific stick of Bessonian bubblegum there lurk pretensions to Kubrick's sci-fi crown. That's to say it starts and ends with an ape at the dawn of time, while its protagonist – as murderous as A Clockwork Orange's Alex DeLarge – has all the emotional sophistication of HAL 9000. But it's bogged down by oodles of exposition over here, and complete incoherence over there. For half the movie – as Lucy gets involved with the botched drug-smuggling plot that results in the super-drug, sewn into her stomach, bursting inside her – chemistry professor Morgan Freeman addresses a lecture hall in Rome so laboriously about consciousness-expansion that you wonder if he'll ever show up in the other half of the movie.</p><p>Said other half of the movie, stripped of all its guff about total awareness from the cellular level to the cosmic etc, is warmed-over Besson Redux: hot action-heroine in the mould of La Femme Nikita, Colombiana, The Messenger and Bandidas; grimy visuals; gratuitous against-the-traffic car chases and over-edited fight scenes; more armies of black-suited Asian villains than any five movies by John Woo; and fewer brains than 20 by Adam Sandler.</p><p>Worst of all, though, Besson's film does nothing to deserve  its primary asset: Johansson herself, who starts out interesting, and ends up being merely and boringly superhuman.</p><p><br /><a href=\"h//www.youtube.com/embed/MVt32qoyhi0?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\">Reading this on mobile?

The actor is waiting for me in a central London hotel and I’ve been asked if I mind having a TV crew follow me to record our initial encounter. The crew have been shadowing Radcliffe for a few days, capturing a hectic schedule that involves promoting his new film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/what-if\">What If</a>, juggling a daunting list of commitments – preparing for stage plays; researching film roles – and, right now, filming what must surely be the most dazzling onscreen role of his career to date: meeting a bloke from the Guardian.</p> <p>“Hello! Great to meet you!” says the artist formerly known as Harry Potter with actorly exaggeration, shaking my hand and welcoming me into his room. I sit down on the designated chair and we pretend to start the interview, until the cameras have slowly retreated from sight. Radcliffe gives me an awkward grimace: “Yeah, sorry about that,” he says, “they just want some footage of me meeting people to show what a press day is like.”</p> <p>Of course, Radcliffe has spent virtually his entire life in front of cameras – whether they were capturing his onscreen debut as a 10-year-old in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(1999_film)\">BBC’s David Copperfield</a>, his teen years spent filming eight Harry Potter films or his every paparazzi-snapped public movement. Like any child star, he’s had to grow up in public, which has meant having to conceal any slight streak of bad behaviour – Radcliffe admitted to having had a drink problem in 2011, several months after he’d gone teetotal – and spending an awful lot of time being asked if his career was likely to implode before most people’s has even begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-67455864-6b1b-4b9f-b386-5e0c2bcfbdea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120258654/13a6b138-9ca0-414f-86c4-cae37e25fe73-347x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film.\" width=\"347\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film. Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Which is hard to deal with,” he says, “because a lot of us already have those fears anyway: what if this doesn’t last for ever?; what if I don’t end up working in 10 years? So for other people to then be asking you about those things all the time is like having your innermost fears confirmed by somebody outside of yourself. And that’s quite a challenging thing when you’re 17.”</p> <p>Today, Radcliffe still faces the same challenge: namely, trying to convince people, and maybe himself, that he’s just a normal guy at heart rather than a damaged boy-wizard. The challenge is no doubt made trickier by the fact he has an estimated net worth of $110m (&pound;66m), according to Forbes, and he was the star of a franchise in which all eight films make the list for the top 50 grossing films of all time (the highest, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NYt1qirBWg\">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2</a>, sits at number four, with a whopping $1.3bn). Having to appear like a normal guy when you’re clearly not – and everyone wants to remind you that you’re not – is likely to be pretty stressful.</p> <p>Then again, Radcliffe seems to run on stress. It’s midday when we meet and he’s already been packing things into his morning. Early on he had to see his doctor about the intense-sounding cluster headaches he gets: “You have to be on blood pressure medication and have an ECG every so often ... but don’t worry, I’m perfectly fine!” Following that he was at the US embassy for an interview, only to be told that he looked tired and not getting enough sleep – “I was like, er, thanks random fucking person who works at the embassy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-482c476d-5b5d-4e42-baf5-5bd2bbaf4d70\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120320631/2caefab3-c0d0-430f-a719-9d548a33e2be-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darling (2013).\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darling (2013). Photograph: Allstar/The Works/Sportsphoto Ltd.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He doesn’t appear the least bit tired when we meet – instead he buzzes with the livewire energy of a workaholic. Radcliffe has talked of working 90-hour weeks and since finishing Potter he has thrown himself into the research-heavy role of Allen Ginsberg in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kill-your-darlings\">Kill Your Darlings</a>, undergone a physically demanding performance in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/18/the-cripple-of-inishmaan-review\">The Cripple of Inishmaan</a> and endured a stamina-sapping 11-month run in Broadway musical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/29/daniel-radcliffe-how-to-succeed-in-business\">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a>. He’s currently having to learn 50 lines of Japanese for the movie <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afm-daniel-radcliffe-star-japanese-653480\">Tokyo Vice</a>, which he thinks might be the hardest of the lot.</p> <p>“I can’t even watch plays or films when I’m learning lines,” he says. “I start to think, hang on, they know all their lines and I don’t ... so I have to go home immediately and learn them.”</p> <p>You might assume that the role Radcliffe’s here to promote today was slightly less stressful: he plays Wallace in twee indie romcom What If, a nerdy yet quick-witted character who he admits is quite similar to himself. But playing himself brought its own headaches: “There’s something quite unnerving about doing so little,” he says, a look of panic suddenly etched on his face. “Like, is this funny? Is this enough? Will this make anyone laugh?”</p> <p>What If follows Wallace’s friendship with Chantry (played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/14/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks\">Zoe Kazan</a>) and involves a will-they-won’t-they-oh-come-on-surely-they-would-have-by-now storyline that makes the characters in One Day seem like hot-headed slaves to reckless abandon. Chantry has a boyfriend, which makes things tricky, although that’s not as much of an obstacle as Wallace’s general rubbishness with the opposite sex, something that threatens to leave him languishing in the “friend zone”. Outside of the UK and US, the film is called The F Word – the F meaning friend, of course – and Radcliffe says the makers were considering calling it The Friend Zone outright before he stepped in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3d365fee-7c5e-4725-bcb9-282e23e48990\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120393916/5c35c52a-cb63-40d4-97f5-86676a25a655-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan in What If.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan in What If. Photograph: Caitlin Cronenberg</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was like, no, we can’t do that, because it’s not a [phrase] I love,” he says, no doubt aware that the phrase has increasingly been under attack from feminists. “The friend zone refers to a very male thing ... you never hear women say they’ve been put in the friend zone. And I think that’s because it’s just used by men who are pissed off that their mate won’t sleep with them.”</p> <p>Despite sharing characteristics with Wallace, Radcliffe says he’s not nearly as useless with women himself: “No, I’m a lot better at being direct at things, I’m not good at suppressing that stuff. If I have a crush on a girl she’s going to know about it.” The girl who currently knows about it is actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3520615/\">Erin Darke</a>, whose love of sports Radcliffe finds a turn on: “She’s an obsessive Detroit Redwings fan – when your girlfriend can talk shit about sports better than the men she’s doing that with, that’s pretty sexy.”</p> <p>What If also features yet another naked scene – something that Radcliffe seems to be making a name for himself with – first onstage in Equus, then for the gay sex scene in Kill Your Darlings and next in the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horns\">Horns</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b95b2b05-c427-49eb-8588-1b7c578d5165\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120455288/82bbba97-7d85-4965-a207-d3b7dbe99e9e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang in Equus at the Gielgud Theatre, London, in 2007.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang in Equus at the Gielgud Theatre, London, in 2007. Photograph: Ray Tang/REX</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I don’t mind it, but I’d like to make clear it’s not a request,” he says, with a nervous grin. “I’m not sat there reading scripts thinking, how can I get my dick out in this one?” He admits the naked scenes have caused him to increase his time in the gym, especially since he watched Kill Your Darlings and thought, “Fuck, I’m skinny as a rat!”</p> <p>With its folky soundtrack and cutesy animation – girls with big, sad eyes abound – What If is an indie film aesthetically as well as technically. Radcliffe has been a vocal indie fan since his teens, when he would turn up in the NME raving about bands like the Libertines and the Cribs in a rather endearing manner. Even today he sounds thrilled that he once got to meet Pete Doherty in a Eurostar station: “He was really really sweet. He let me waffle on for five minutes about how brilliant I thought his music was.”</p> <p>Compared with most, Radcliffe’s musical education was pretty unorthodox. He was introduced to Pink Floyd and the Kinks by the driver who took him to the Harry Potter studios each day, and his dresser on Potter taught him about 1970s punk. Eventually he found his own thing and even went to Reading festival a couple of times. Didn’t he get hassled?</p> <p>“No, not too much. I wore a gas mask for most of the time.”</p> <p>A gas mask?!</p> <p>“I was with Rupert Grint and we really didn’t want to be recognised.”</p> <p>There seems something slightly sad about having to go to a music festival dressed as if you were heading to the western front. Does Radcliffe worry that he missed out on a normal teenagedom? He sighs. “I mean, maybe? I don’t know. I still got to go to Reading. I still had a great time. It’s one of those things that everyone wants to tell me I missed out on ... but I wouldn’t know, I’ve only lived my life this way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0tTp25txOE\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0tTp25txOE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Radcliffe starred in the video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0tTp25txOE\">Slow Club’s Beginners</a>, in which he stumbled around a London pub, playing air guitar in the part of someone drunk out of their mind. He says he doesn’t like to talk about his drinking problems, but admits that they did inspire his performance in that video: “Of course, it would be foolish to pretend it wasn’t.” Yet when I ask if that means he’d ever been in quite that much of a mess himself during his drinking days he fixes me with a surprisingly icy stare: “Why would you ask that when you know I don’t like to talk about it?”</p> <p>Radcliffe is still scarred by the fact he ever admitted to having an issue with alcohol. “If I had to give my younger self one piece of advice it would be, don’t talk about that in an interview,” he says. “Because I’ve answered questions on it for three or four years since. And it’s such an insignificant part of my life that everyone just wants to talk about.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b1b10ab-3268-4296-b1db-c4da2d5fb730\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120657639/4ae73164-2f2d-48b5-91e3-2c8f7a64b65c-460x338.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Billy and Sarah Greene as Helen in The Cripple of Inishmaan\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Billy and Sarah Greene as Helen in The Cripple of Inishmaan Photograph: Johan Persson</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thing is, I say, the crux of what he was saying was refreshingly open and mature: that he was cutting out all drink and drugs to avoid the cliched route of the tortured child star. “Well, yeah,” he says. “That wasn’t really a matter of maturity, it was just something I needed to do.”</p> <p>It’s hard to argue with Radcliffe’s contention that everyone wants to talk about it. I wonder if he has ever Googled himself and seen the automatic search entries, but before I finish the question he’s started reeling them off: “Daniel Radcliffe alcoholic. Daniel Radcliffe gay. Daniel Radcliffe girlfriend,” he says, sighing as he does. Actually, I tell him, girlfriend is the top result these days.</p> <p>“Oh great – I’ll take that, as these things go. I’m pleased my girlfriend comes up before alcoholic or gay. When I first did that, I got really annoyed for about half a minute, until I tried a few other people’s names and I found out [gay] comes up after almost everyone if they’re a man, and even some women – Florence Welch had it, and I was like, really?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A86JGbBEaBk\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86JGbBEaBk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Maybe it’s a sign that a star has made it. “Probably. If people are speculating about your sexuality, then you’re doing OK,” he laughs, then says that these days he resists the temptation to self-Google as “it fucks you up. You shouldn’t be on there if you’re an actor. There’s a line in The Thick Of It – Googling yourself is like opening the door to a room full of people telling you how shit you are – and it’s exactly that. I first did it in my late teens and it was such a destructive thing for me to do.”</p> <p>These days, Radcliffe says smoking is his only remaining vice – and he does much less of that since he’s taken up running in preparation to play Seb Coe in the Olympics film Gold. Running, learning Japanese, 90-hour weeks ... does he put too much pressure on himself? He says not, so I ask him about a quote in which he said he sometimes heard voices telling him he was going to fail.</p> <p>“I was obviously not being literal,” he says. “But I think I have to apply that amount of pressure to myself because I want to do well. Now, maybe that’s not the healthiest way to function … but also, frankly, since the age of 20, all of the interviews I’ve done have involved people asking about my impending failure, and how I felt about the possibility of that. And so, when you’re confronted with that so often, you start to react to it. My own reaction was always to kick hard against it and think, fuck it, you might as well be bold now, make some interesting choices and see where that takes you.”</p> <p>Wherever that may be, you suspect there will be plenty more cameras around – and Radcliffe won’t be giving himself much of a break.</p> <p>• What If is released in the UK on Wednesday 20 August</p>","headline":"Daniel

Here six US comics tell the Guardian how he affected their career and, in some cases, their paths into comedy. </p> <h2><strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/margaretcho\">Margaret Cho</a></strong></strong><br /></h2> <p>Robin Williams was the first famous person I ever met, and he used to come to my family’s bookstore, and my father got me his autograph in a copy of The World According to Garp. As a comedian, he was the patriarch in our clan of San Francisco comedians. I had the terror of having to follow him on stage many times, and would make the pathetic joke, “I know this is an open mic, but I must be doing well if Robin Williams is opening for me!”<br /></p> <p>As an artist, Robin Williams represented the dizzy heights of brilliance we could aspire to. He was absolutely free and absolutely stunning – he could do anything and often did.</p> <p>I will always treasure the countless amazing sets I got to see – Robin performing to eight or 12 people late at night in the little comedy club across from my first apartment, the Holy City Zoo. This was before iPhones and social media and so everyone was there – no phones or photos – they were present and smack dab in the presence of true greatness, not believing their own good luck.<br /></p> <h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kumailn\">Kumail Nanjiani</a></h2> <p>When I was a kid, my favourite cartoon character was Popeye. I convinced myself spinach tasted good because of him. One day I found an old magazine that had a live action Popeye on the cover. “There’s a Popeye MOVIE?!?” I made my dad track it down in Pakistan, and it blew me away. I don’t remember much about the movie, it had some plot about a baby that could predict horse races or something, but I do remember Robin Williams being amazing. He wasn’t just <em>like</em> Popeye, he <em>was</em> Popeye. From then on, I watched everything he was in. He is truly the only performer I have loved my entire life. There is no point of my life where Robin Williams wasn’t on my top five coolest people list. I never regretted watching a Robin Williams movie, because he was in it. I remember specifically arguing with my friends about which movies to rent. “But how can it be bad? Robin Williams is in it!”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-16411322-b5d5-4fc0-b1fa-61224d8bbe72\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408133285555/42bf32f6-b9a6-4d45-a4c9-f50b7b012842-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Popeye Robin Williams \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Robin Williams in the film Popeye</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/chrisgethard\">Chris Gethard </a></strong></h2> <p>Robin Williams is a big reason I wanted to be an improviser, which has become the foundation of my whole career. When I watched his specials, he seemed very happy when things fell apart, when curveballs came his way, when he could walk into a direction no one saw coming, least of all himself. It was riveting and inspiring.<br /></p> <p>As an adult who spent his time as a comedian struggling with bad depression issues, Robin Williams took on a more special meaning to me. Even as his movies trended away from his earlier, riskier stuff, he continued to play roles with tons of heart and empathy that showed he wasn’t just a manic oddball, he was a guy who had real depth and struggles and was brave enough to show them to the world through his characters.</p> <p>One thing I always think about is how he dressed up as Andy Kaufman’s grandma and sat on stage throughout Kaufman’s Carnegie Hall concert. Robin was one of the biggest stars in the world by that time, and he sat there in prosthetics for a whole show only to reveal himself at the end. And I think about how joyous that moment was, and how he didn’t need to sit on anyone else’s stage if he wanted to be ego-driven, but he wasn’t – instead, he was dedicated to giving the audience a magical moment and being a small part of something meaningful. You saw Robin pop up in small roles in other people’s projects from time to time, and I always loved that – he wanted to be a part of cool, meaningful things, and he wanted to lend his celebrity towards getting focus to other people’s stuff when he believed in it. That is a beautiful way to be.<br /></p> <h2><strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouieAnderson\">Louie Anderson</a></strong></strong></h2> <p>He made me want to work the audience, be off the cuff, be better, take more risks. We were in the same arena but I was more of a guernsey, a milk cow, and he was a crazy wild steer. He influenced the arc of the 1980s comedians’ careers, and I’m one of them. He provided the silliness and mischievousness for those who are around today. He laid down a tapestry. He showed us that the sky’s the limit.<br /></p> <p>The special he did on HBO, where he was like a firefly in a jar, he did Shakespeare and sang Bruce Springsteen as Elmer Fudd – he did things you never thought of. You just went, wow, like someone lit a fuse to something that was connected to a giant keg of dynamite.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCpTAJDhb5U\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCpTAJDhb5U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraJBenincasa\">Sara Benicasa</a></strong></h2> <p>As a comedian, Robin Williams meant everything to me. Sometimes I forget to even list him as an influence because to me it’s so obvious – he’s part of the cultural fabric in such a way that it is impossible for him to not be an influence! I just always assume that everybody in comedy is doing it in part because of Robin Williams. I could never hope to be so brilliant. But he gave us a goal to strive for.<br /></p> <p>We are so lucky that we got so many years with such a magnificent, generous weirdo. I have so many friends with wonderful Robin Williams stories. He’d show up at an improv show or a standup show and make sure to greet every comic, compliment their work, encourage them to keep going. He must have known, in a very kind and non-egotistical way, that a kind word from him could change a person’s life for the better. I hope he knew it, anyway.</p> <p>He used to talk about safe sex in the 80s, before it was particularly common or acceptable to discuss the HIV/AIDS crisis in public. I remember him doing a bit about “prophylactics” and I was so young. I turned to my dad and asked,”What is a prophylactic?” It created an awkward moment for my thirty-something father but it was educational! That’s part of what Robin Williams did with socially conscious material – he made you laugh, but he also taught you something, and not in a preachy way, either.<br /></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealGilbert\">Gilbert Gottfried</a></strong></h2> <p>It was an accidental friendship. We had a connection through Aladdin but never met during the recording. We knew each other from the clubs. He was a generous colleague. One time way back, I wasn’t really known at the time, and I was about to go on stage. At the last minute Robin popped in and the club owners decided, nope, we’re putting Robin on. But Robin said a few people in the audience would really like to see Gilbert first. I went on stage and did well and when I walked off Robin was wiping tears from his eyes and said, “Gilbert, you’ve really baked my cookies”. Meaning I’d made him laugh. It’s really unusual to offer the spotlight to someone else. </p>","headline":"'Robin Williams meant everything to me' – comedians offer their memories","trailText":"Six American comics recall the influence and inspiration Robin Williams represented for them<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/17/1408281913679/69bf027d-8450-4bc5-8df3-1e27b7734ba9-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1229","commentable":"true","byline":"Amanda Holpuch, Rory Carroll and Ruth Spencer","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-20T09:30:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/robin-williams-us-comedians-memories","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/17/robin-williams-us-comedians-memories","tags":[{"id":"film/robin-williams","webTitle":"Robin Williams","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robin-williams","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/robin-williams","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"stage/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/amanda-holpuch","webTitle":"Amanda Holpuch","r2ContributorId":"50290","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/28/1359390632771/Amanda_Holpuch.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Amanda is a reporter at the Guardian US.

I was supposed to go with them and introduce them on stage. I arrived at the hall, and who should be sitting in the front row but Robin Williams. I had met him a couple of times, and went up to him and re-introduced myself. And asked him if he'd like to voice Dennis the Dog for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727770/\" title=\"\"><em>Absolutely Anything</em></a><em> </em>[Jones's forthcoming film]. He agreed at once. I later sent him the script, and he emailed me back: \"Let's get this film made now!\"</p><p>Alas! Four years later we finally got the money to make the film. We had Mojo the Dog playing Dennis, and doing it brilliantly. If only Robin Williams could do the voice we'd be over the moon. I emailed him with a sinking heart, fearing that so much time had elapsed and he may not want to voice Dennis. But I need not have feared. He wrote back that he was up for voicing the dog.</p><p>And here's the story: Robin was a perfectionist. The first time we tried to voice Dennis it was a Skype call with an interminable delay. Robin was not satisfied with the result. He kept on saying: \"I don't mind if you get someone else to voice it.\" But we couldn't do that. Eventually Bill (who with Ben was producing <em>Absolutely Anything</em>) and I went over to San Francisco to re-record Robin. And he still wasn't satisfied. A couple of hours after the recording, he rang me on my mobile and said: \"I just had an inspiration! Dennis is a 16-year-old boy!\"</p><p>So for third time, back in London, we recorded Robin Williams voicing Dennis the Dog. And it worked! It was an inspiration.</p><p>Above all, what I remember about Robin was his humility. He could be funny as no one else could be funny – like he had another monumental voice telling him to be funny – let it&nbsp;rip!</p><p>He could have had a huge ego. But he didn't.</p>","headline":"Robin Williams appreciation by Terry Jones: 'He could have had a huge ego, but he didn't'","trailText":"<p>Monty Python's <strong>Terry Jones</strong> tells how the comedy perfectionist finally nailed the part of a talking dog in Jones's new film</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408113912906/Humility-Robin-Williams-i-006.jpg","wordcount":"356","commentable":"true","byline":"Terry Jones","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-06T23:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/terry-jones-robin-williams-appreciation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/17/terry-jones-robin-williams-appreciation","tags":[{"id":"film/robin-williams","webTitle":"Robin Williams","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robin-williams","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/robin-williams","references":[]},{"id":"culture/monty-python","webTitle":"Monty Python","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/monty-python","references":[]},{"id":"film/monty-python-s-life-of-brian","webTitle":"Monty Python's Life of Brian","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/monty-python-s-life-of-brian","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/monty-python-s-life-of-brian","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/terryjones","webTitle":"Terry Jones","rcsId":"GNL008417","r2ContributorId":"22182","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/22/1385141948127/Terry-Jones.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Terry Jones is a film director, actor and Python <a href=\"http://terryjones.tumblr.com/\">Terry-jones.net</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/terryjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/terryjones","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-444651209","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408113902450/Humility-Robin-Williams-i-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","source":"  epa/Corbis","photographer":"Tracey Nearmy","altText":"'Humility': Robin Williams in 2011.","suppliersReference":"31082787","height":"54","credit":"Tracey Nearmy/  epa/Corbis","caption":"'Humility': Robin Williams in 2011.

Until one manic genius pulled off a breathtaking coup…<br /><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/terry-jones-robin-williams-appreciation\">Monty Python's Terry Jones on Robin Williams</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>1981. 4am, Brixton. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Richardson_(English_director)\" title=\"\">Peter Richardson</a> and I have heard that there's supposed to be a party at an address in Brixton, so we've gone down there after the gig at the Comedy Store. We have this squirty American guy with us, who's just played a blinding set at the store and looks a bit lost, so we invited him along.</p><p>When we get there, we don't have to ring on the bell, the door is hanging wide open. There are two people asleep on their feet – leaning on each other – dancing to the repetitive scratch from the long-finished vinyl on the mono record-player. On the floor are a couple of sleeping junkies. There's no booze left and ashtrays are full of butts. This is one dodgy party, like something Super Hans from <em>Peep&nbsp;Show</em> might have left three hours&nbsp;ago.</p><p>The American guy hangs back at the front door, reluctant to get involved. Oh well – I offer to drive him to his digs, wherever they are, expecting perhaps Islington or Shepherd's Bush, but we end up going all the way back into town. He's staying at the Park Lane hotel. Who is this guy? In those pre-Google days, it took us a week or so to find out that he was Mork from a TV show we'd never heard of, and was – well, basically – an international comedy star.</p><p>In those early right-on days of the <a href=\"http://thecomedystore.co.uk/london/\" title=\"\">Comedy Store</a> there were a couple of principles that comics were supposed to adhere to: \"non-sexist, non-racist\" comedy. Alternative comedy, that was the name of the game. But there was also another, unspoken tenet, which was \"non-American\". There was a lot of prejudice and snobbishness among comics about the American way of doing stuff, which was ironic considering that the whole concept of a Comedy Store was an import from the US. Just as punk had rejected the large-scale, smooth, hairy music of the 70s, we were supposed to scorn the Americans for their slick, wise-cracking humour, and get on with being plain old British stupid. Ironic, too, that most comics then, as now, would have sold their children to make it in the&nbsp;States.</p><p>So when Robin Williams was first announced on the Comedy Store stage, his appearance was greeted with British elitist indifference. However, an hour and 10 minutes later, the game plan had changed. Most people's sets would be 10 minutes, 20 minutes max. There was a gong, so if the audience shouted for it loud enough, the compere would come on, beat the gong, and the&nbsp;act&nbsp;would leave the stage, humbled.</p><p>What happened that night was unprecedented. Russell Brand recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/russell-brand-robin-williams-divine-madness-broken-world\" title=\"\">described Williams's live act</a> as being as if he was sitting on a geyser of comedy, which he would un-valve to let some out, rather than being thought up or invented by the man himself. I think this is pretty accurate; a stream of a thousand different voices, people and surreal concepts, all arguing in his head. It was breathtaking, literally, because when you laugh that much there is no time to draw in air. Williams was cleverer, faster and madder than his audience.</p><p>When, a year or so later, we started the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comic_Strip\" title=\"\">Comic Strip club</a>, down the road from the Comedy Store in Walker's Court, we invited Robin to come back and use London to try out new material. I think he found it refreshing to be able to play a small venue without the pressure of his fame – which was only just beginning to grow in England – and the expectation that always accompanies it. He came a couple of times and, of course, did not respect the time slots or running orders. But we were happy for that because watching him from the side was inspirational, and the audiences couldn't believe what they were getting. He would leap in among them and, for instance, grab and start to go through a woman's hand bag – perhaps an old trick now – but then it was shocking and exciting. He would pull the items out and make them into puppets which had conversations with each other, with no regard for the feelings of the owner of the bag. He was not one of those \"I'm only kidding, I love you all really\" type of comics. He really took it close&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;unacceptable. It was wonderful.</p><p>The only trouble was, he couldn't stop doing it. Backstage, in the dressing rooms, on the stairs, the stream of consciousness continued. The jabbering multitude of voices, the need to make everyone around him laugh, all the time. He wouldn't be happy until the furniture was laughing. He had a bad case of what we in the business call \"Comic's Disease\". This is such a gift to the rest&nbsp;of the world but, as we saw last&nbsp;week, it can be a heavy load to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>I suppose everyone has a different way of dealing with their demons, and we have to be thankful that Robin Williams's way brought so much pleasure to so many people. It's been a bad year for the gods taking away funny people. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jul/21/mel-smith\" title=\"\">Mel Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/16/roger-lloyd-pack\" title=\"\">Roger Lloyd-Pack</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/15/sam-kelly\" title=\"\">Sam Kelly</a>, our very own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall\" title=\"\">Rik</a>. It's been so bad, in fact, that now, when I see a photo of a funny person come up on telly or in the news, my first reaction is to think, \"Oh no,&nbsp;not&nbsp;him/her too.\" What's going&nbsp;on?</p><p>We'll never know the exact reason for Robin Williams's decision last week. Perhaps it was money troubles? Perhaps the divorces? Perhaps the addictions? Was he on antidepressants – which sometimes have the paradoxical side-effect of inducing suicidal thoughts?</p><p>Heartfelt condolences to all the family and kids he left behind.</p>","headline":"Robin Williams appreciation by Nigel Planer: 'He wouldn't be happy until the furniture was laughing'","trailText":"<p>American standups were looked down on by Britain's new wave in the early 80s, writes former Young One <strong>Nigel Planer</strong>.

I realise this may be a massive oversight on my part, but if I ever come to regret it, it won't be because of the movies. I can think of barely a handful of films that make that country look like a charming and delightful place to live – and any number that portray it as a vast, lawless no-go zone in which people subsist in a state of crazed, feral desperation.

But that film's world was almost cosy compared to that depicted in Michôd's follow-up <em>The Rover</em>, a bleak and extremely violent vision of earthly hell in a dystopian future.</p><p><em>The Rover </em>is a desert-set drama that takes place, an opening title tells us, \"10 years after the collapse\". That collapse, apparently economic and global, has left society in a state of fragmentation and extreme deprivation. The protagonist is a man named Eric (Guy Pearce), first seen staring into the void across an inhospitable expanse of dust. When his car is stolen by a group of desperadoes, Eric takes off in the renegades' own abandoned vehicle, icily stares down their guns and demands his car back. And he won't rest until he gets it.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-428397631\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/29/140129Rover-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/29/140129Rover/140129Rover.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/29/140129Rover_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/29/140129Rover_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/29//140129Rover.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>Later, pursuing his mission across the desert, he visits a house where a disturbingly calm elderly woman (Gillian Jones, in a performance that gently chills your blood) tries to pimp him her grandson. But Eric is interested in only one thing. \"You must really love that car, darling,\" sighs the woman. \"What a thing to get worked up about in this day and age.\"</p><p>She, it's clear, is not one to get worked up over anything and gazes calmly at Eric as if it doesn't matter whether death comes right this instant or sometime during the next sentence. That's one thing that <em>The Rover </em>acutely captures, a world in which death is ever-present, because everyone is only nominally alive. Eric is a prime example of the \"already dead\" existential hero, facing down the world with steely-souled detachment and is as ready to kill as anyone else.</p><p>The car thieves include an American named Henry (Scoot McNairy), whose brother, Rey (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson\" title=\"\">Robert Pattinson</a>), becomes Eric's reluctant travelling companion. Eric, out of expediency as much as compassion, gets Rey's wounds fixed by one person still worthy of the epithet \"human\" – a doctor (Susan Prior) who has opted out of society to tend to stray dogs, which she keeps locked up because people keep trying to eat them. Eric also happens on a military encampment, where the commanding officer assures him that there is some sort of government still operating, but that no one should expect it to care about them.</p><p>Michôd and his collaborators, including actor Joel Edgerton, who doesn't appear but has a co-writing credit, have convincingly and comprehensively imagined a world of breakdown reeking of rust and squalor. Cinematographer Natasha Braier and production designer Jo Ford evoke a widescreen vista of aridity and fuggy light, of sand, scrub and knackered metal; the fugitives' hideout is a grey dive redolent of unwashed vests and old men's armpits. Pearce's Eric totally belongs to this world – skin mottled and leathery, hair scraggy and thinned out, face coming to life in the occasional wary flaring of his nostrils, as if he had only survived by semi-mutating into a scrubland rodent.</p><p>It's a tough, scarily understated characterisation. Alas, Robert Pattinson's confused man-boy Rey doesn't quite measure up. He fits the role physically, his big, blocky head cropped, dirt-smeared and scabbed, but he overburdens the character with ruminative \"mm-hmm\" mannerisms awkwardly reminiscent of Billy Bob Thornton in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/feb/18/life1.lifemagazine5\" title=\"\"><em>Sling Blade</em></a>. Pattinson has proved he can go way beyond his <em>Twilight</em> range, notably in David Cronenberg's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/17/cosmopolis-david-cronenberg-pattinson-review\" title=\"\"><em>Cosmopolis</em></a>, but he doesn't quite pull it off here.</p><p>When Eric's grim back story emerges, you realise just why he seems even more dead than everyone around him. But when Michôd adds the very final twist, it feels like a bathetic punchline to an overextended shaggy dog story.</p><p><em>The Rover </em>never delivers on the promise of its first third, but that opening stretch is something, a tight-lipped, hyper-atmospheric exercise in that neo-spaghetti western style you might call \"Phony Leone\". Antony Partos's score features guitar that veer from grungy metallic rasp to a baleful, distant dead clang, and Sam Petty's sound design – insects, raspy motors, the death-rattle crunch of gravel – is meshed in wonderfully.</p><p>Overall, an honourable misfire for David Michôd – and another catastrophic blow for the Australian tourist board.</p>","headline":"The Rover review – 'an honourable misfire' of a dystopian drama","trailText":"Guy Pearce is excellent but Robert Pattinson fails to convince in David Michôd's extremely violent and bleak vision of the future, writes <strong>Jonathan Romney</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407943005374/Guy-Pearce-and-Robert-Pat-006.jpg","wordcount":"812","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Jonathan Romney","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-13T15:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/the-rover-review-honourable-misfire-guy-pearce","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/17/the-rover-review-honourable-misfire-guy-pearce","tags":[{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/sciencefictionandfantasy","webTitle":"Science fiction and fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","references":[]},{"id":"film/robert-pattinson","webTitle":"Robert Pattinson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/robert-pattinson","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathan-romney","webTitle":"Jonathan Romney","r2ContributorId":"59240","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Film critic and contributing editor of Sight &amp; Sound</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-romney","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonathan-romney","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-444467281","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407942996861/Guy-Pearce-and-Robert-Pat-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"¬© Rover Film Holdings P/L","source":"Allstar","altText":"Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson in the outback dystopia of The Rover.","suppliersReference":"ENT_SAI32590","height":"54","credit":"Allstar","caption":"Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson in the outback dystopia of The Rover.

This action franchise, in which Hollywood OAPs go OTT, is as tough as a piece of gristle. Speaking of which… Sylvester Stallone returns to lead his ragtag group of mercenary mates into another skirmish in a fictional eastern European country that might as well be called Un-America. Joining Sly this time round are a chatty Spaniard (Antonio Banderas), a black man who says \"Damn!\" (Wesley Snipes) and – shock of shocks – a woman (Ronda Rousey).</p><p>They're on the tail of Conrad Stonebanks, a rogue Expendable deemed super-Expendable after hospitalising one of the crew. He's played by Mel Gibson, who is greeted with a tuba blast of doom every time he appears on screen. We apparently need musical cues to tell us Mel Gibson is a wrong 'un. This is pretty basic stuff.</p><p>Still, there's something in the macho sparring, the wanton death toll and the massive explosions that taps into the reptilian brain. Plus, Sly's not shy of giving the heartstrings the odd, brief yank. \"We're not the future anymore,\" he tells his crew, staring glumly down the barrel of senescence. Seconds later, he's shaken the malaise and is back to murdering foreigners.

of Death, the mastermind of multimillion-dollar arms deals that benefited the Taliban in the aftermath of 9/11. The truth, say film-makers Tony Gerber and Maxim Pozdorovkin, is murkier but far more entertaining. They see Bout, a Russian \"entrepreneur\" who shipped everything from cola to zoo animals alongside guns, as more chancer than villain. Using home videos (Bout was a camcorder nut) and extensive interviews with his wife, former business partners and the DEA agents who caught him, Gerber and Pozdorovkin introduce a garrulous, intelligent man who had transported arms for years and was eventually undone by a post-9/11 crackdown.</p><p>Bout, who was Hollywoodised by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/oct/16/features.review3\" title=\"\"><em>Lord of War</em></a>, is painted as a victim of his own success, a weapons dealer who started earning too much buck for his bang. The arms trade has always been shady. Governments want it that way. Bout worked in the grey areas, crossing the line morally, if not legally, many times over. \"He's not the Merchant of Death, he's a merchant of <em>some</em> death,\" says an old acquaintance.

Shot with a&nbsp;besotted camera that gives sand the shimmer of silk, the landscape is at once an antagonist and an object of celebration in this lean, literate biopic of Robyn Davidson, the headstrong young explorer who in 1977 set out to cross the 1,700-mile west Australian desert on foot.

A sterling box-office run and two consecutive number 1 weekends that will do no harm in marketing the movie across DVD and digital platforms bode well. Last weekend's opening numbers were very strong indeed, and the Turtles followed up with a solid $28.4m in the second weekend after a 57% box office fall. That the movie cost $125m will be of concern, because there is still a way to go before it recoups. Distributors take roughly half of theatrical box office (the balance goes to the cinema chains) and then there are marketing costs to deduct. For a tentpole summer release with global reach, those costs are expected to be at least $50m, possibly considerably more. So the theatrical performance is crucial to drive interest in the ancillary markets, and this has been a very promising start. By comparison, Warner Bros' 2007 release TMNT finished on $54m.</p><h2>The Expendables 3 limps into action</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-444474167\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/13/140813Expendables3/140813Expendables3.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />The boys-with-toys action release delivered the feeblest debut of the franchise, on an estimated $16.2m through Lionsgate that secured fifth place in the charts.

The Expendables 3 has every chance of succeeding internationally, of course, because audiences in less mature markets still put most things Hollywood on a pedestal. The action sequel debuted in approximately 39 territories at the weekend and we may not get those results until Monday or Tuesday.<br /></p><h2>The Giver doesn't give back</h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uxFJvlWqphM\">Reading on mobile? Click here</a><br />Harvey Weinstein's YA (young adult) adaptation, based on the revered schoolchild staple by Lois Lowry, opened at number five on $12.8m, which cannot have pleased the studios' combustible chief. After a heavy promotional push at the recent Comic-Con in San Diego and plenty of advertising spots, the movie arrived with something of a whimper. Reviews were generally poor and maybe audience ennui is setting in with the blizzard of YA movies. It's hard to tell if that is good or bad for Fox's upcoming release The Maze Runner, which is packed with virile young talent, many of them unknown, and lacks the star power of The Giver. The Weinstein movie stars Brenton Thwaites from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/maleficent-review-angelina-jolie-sleeping-beauty-horns-vinegar\" title=\"\">Maleficent</a>, alongside Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes and Alexander Skaarsgard. Heck, it even features a cameo by Taylor Swift. The Maze Runner opens on 19 September. The Giver looks likely to exit the top 10 within several weeks.</p><h2>Boyhood bounces back – again</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-441840743\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood/140711TGFSBoyhood.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/11/140711TGFSBoyhood.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />Richard Linklater's beloved coming-of-age drama is like a slo-mo yo-yo, popping in and out of the top 10 but never straying too far. In its sixth session IFC boosted the theatre-count from 506 to 771. That helped the movie surge three places to number 10 and add $2.2m for $13.8m. This is a spectacular result for a $4m production cost, given that IFC has not spent much on marketing. That's no slight to the distributor; they tend not to shell out heavily in the promotional department, fully aware their movies are destined to play across digital platforms. They may need to revise that spending policy when awards season kicks in, because a lot of Hollywood insiders are expecting the movie to sparkle.</p><h2>The Trip to Italy</h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/55OtglvtXuI\">Reading on mobile? Click here</a><br />The prolific Michael Winterbottom returns with a rather needless but nonetheless entertaining comedy follow-up to The Trip. Those who saw it in the US adored The Trip, as they should, and there is a core following for Winterbottom's work,  too. The Trip to Italy arrived in three sites and grossed $71,6000 for an excellent $23,867 average. IFC is the distributor, as it was on The Trip, which finished on $2m back in 2011.</p><h2>North American top 10, August 15-17 2014</h2><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles\" title=\"\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, $28.4m.

given up Googling himself, he doesn’t actually demand nude scenes in his films, and it was a big mistake talking about the drinking: the former Harry Potter actor on trying to convince people he’s just a normal guy</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Before I meet Daniel Radcliffe properly, I have to pretend to meet him. The actor is waiting for me in a central London hotel and I’ve been asked if I mind having a TV crew follow me to record our initial encounter. The crew have been shadowing Radcliffe for a few days, capturing a hectic schedule that involves promoting his new film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/what-if\">What If</a>, juggling a daunting list of commitments – preparing for stage plays; researching film roles – and, right now, filming what must surely be the most dazzling onscreen role of his career to date: meeting a bloke from the Guardian.</p> <p>“Hello! Great to meet you!” says the artist formerly known as Harry Potter with actorly exaggeration, shaking my hand and welcoming me into his room. I sit down on the designated chair and we pretend to start the interview, until the cameras have slowly retreated from sight. Radcliffe gives me an awkward grimace: “Yeah, sorry about that,” he says, “they just want some footage of me meeting people to show what a press day is like.”</p> <p>Of course, Radcliffe has spent virtually his entire life in front of cameras – whether they were capturing his onscreen debut as a 10-year-old in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(1999_film)\">BBC’s David Copperfield</a>, his teen years spent filming eight Harry Potter films or his every paparazzi-snapped public movement. Like any child star, he’s had to grow up in public, which has meant having to conceal any slight streak of bad behaviour – Radcliffe admitted to having had a drink problem in 2011, several months after he’d gone teetotal – and spending an awful lot of time being asked if his career was likely to implode before most people’s has even begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-67455864-6b1b-4b9f-b386-5e0c2bcfbdea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120258654/13a6b138-9ca0-414f-86c4-cae37e25fe73-347x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film.\" width=\"347\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film. Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Which is hard to deal with,” he says, “because a lot of us already have those fears anyway: what if this doesn’t last for ever?; what if I don’t end up working in 10 years? So for other people to then be asking you about those things all the time is like having your innermost fears confirmed by somebody outside of yourself. And that’s quite a challenging thing when you’re 17.”</p> <p>Today, Radcliffe still faces the same challenge: namely, trying to convince people, and maybe himself, that he’s just a normal guy at heart rather than a damaged boy-wizard. The challenge is no doubt made trickier by the fact he has an estimated net worth of $110m (&pound;66m), according to Forbes, and he was the star of a franchise in which all eight films make the list for the top 50 grossing films of all time (the highest, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NYt1qirBWg\">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2</a>, sits at number four, with a whopping $1.3bn). Having to appear like a normal guy when you’re clearly not – and everyone wants to remind you that you’re not – is likely to be pretty stressful.</p> <p>Then again, Radcliffe seems to run on stress. It’s midday when we meet and he’s already been packing things into his morning. Early on he had to see his doctor about the intense-sounding cluster headaches he gets: “You have to be on blood pressure medication and have an ECG every so often ... but don’t worry, I’m perfectly fine!” Following that he was at the US embassy for an interview, only to be told that he looked tired and not getting enough sleep – “I was like, er, thanks random fucking person who works at the embassy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-482c476d-5b5d-4e42-baf5-5bd2bbaf4d70\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120320631/2caefab3-c0d0-430f-a719-9d548a33e2be-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darling (2013).\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darling (2013). Photograph: Allstar/The Works/Sportsphoto Ltd.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He doesn’t appear the least bit tired when we meet – instead he buzzes with the livewire energy of a workaholic. Radcliffe has talked of working 90-hour weeks and since finishing Potter he has thrown himself into the research-heavy role of Allen Ginsberg in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kill-your-darlings\">Kill Your Darlings</a>, undergone a physically demanding performance in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/18/the-cripple-of-inishmaan-review\">The Cripple of Inishmaan</a> and endured a stamina-sapping 11-month run in Broadway musical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/29/daniel-radcliffe-how-to-succeed-in-business\">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a>. He’s currently having to learn 50 lines of Japanese for the movie <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afm-daniel-radcliffe-star-japanese-653480\">Tokyo Vice</a>, which he thinks might be the hardest of the lot.</p> <p>“I can’t even watch plays or films when I’m learning lines,” he says. “I start to think, hang on, they know all their lines and I don’t ... so I have to go home immediately and learn them.”</p> <p>You might assume that the role Radcliffe’s here to promote today was slightly less stressful: he plays Wallace in twee indie romcom What If, a nerdy yet quick-witted character who he admits is quite similar to himself. But playing himself brought its own headaches: “There’s something quite unnerving about doing so little,” he says, a look of panic suddenly etched on his face. “Like, is this funny? Is this enough? Will this make anyone laugh?”</p> <p>What If follows Wallace’s friendship with Chantry (played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/14/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks\">Zoe Kazan</a>) and involves a will-they-won’t-they-oh-come-on-surely-they-would-have-by-now storyline that makes the characters in One Day seem like hot-headed slaves to reckless abandon. Chantry has a boyfriend, which makes things tricky, although that’s not as much of an obstacle as Wallace’s general rubbishness with the opposite sex, something that threatens to leave him languishing in the “friend zone”. Outside of the UK and US, the film is called The F Word – the F meaning friend, of course – and Radcliffe says the makers were considering calling it The Friend Zone outright before he stepped in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3d365fee-7c5e-4725-bcb9-282e23e48990\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120393916/5c35c52a-cb63-40d4-97f5-86676a25a655-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan in What If.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan in What If. Photograph: Caitlin Cronenberg</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was like, no, we can’t do that, because it’s not a [phrase] I love,” he says, no doubt aware that the phrase has increasingly been under attack from feminists. “The friend zone refers to a very male thing ... you never hear women say they’ve been put in the friend zone. And I think that’s because it’s just used by men who are pissed off that their mate won’t sleep with them.”</p> <p>Despite sharing characteristics with Wallace, Radcliffe says he’s not nearly as useless with women himself: “No, I’m a lot better at being direct at things, I’m not good at suppressing that stuff. If I have a crush on a girl she’s going to know about it.” The girl who currently knows about it is actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3520615/\">Erin Darke</a>, whose love of sports Radcliffe finds a turn on: “She’s an obsessive Detroit Redwings fan – when your girlfriend can talk shit about sports better than the men she’s doing that with, that’s pretty sexy.”</p> <p>What If also features yet another naked scene – something that Radcliffe seems to be making a name for himself with – first onstage in Equus, then for the gay sex scene in Kill Your Darlings and next in the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horns\">Horns</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b95b2b05-c427-49eb-8588-1b7c578d5165\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120455288/82bbba97-7d85-4965-a207-d3b7dbe99e9e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang in Equus at the Gielgud Theatre, London, in 2007.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang in Equus at the Gielgud Theatre, London, in 2007. Photograph: Ray Tang/REX</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I don’t mind it, but I’d like to make clear it’s not a request,” he says, with a nervous grin. “I’m not sat there reading scripts thinking, how can I get my dick out in this one?” He admits the naked scenes have caused him to increase his time in the gym, especially since he watched Kill Your Darlings and thought, “Fuck, I’m skinny as a rat!”</p> <p>With its folky soundtrack and cutesy animation – girls with big, sad eyes abound – What If is an indie film aesthetically as well as technically. Radcliffe has been a vocal indie fan since his teens, when he would turn up in the NME raving about bands like the Libertines and the Cribs in a rather endearing manner. Even today he sounds thrilled that he once got to meet Pete Doherty in a Eurostar station: “He was really really sweet. He let me waffle on for five minutes about how brilliant I thought his music was.”</p> <p>Compared with most, Radcliffe’s musical education was pretty unorthodox. He was introduced to Pink Floyd and the Kinks by the driver who took him to the Harry Potter studios each day, and his dresser on Potter taught him about 1970s punk. Eventually he found his own thing and even went to Reading festival a couple of times. Didn’t he get hassled?</p> <p>“No, not too much. I wore a gas mask for most of the time.”</p> <p>A gas mask?!</p> <p>“I was with Rupert Grint and we really didn’t want to be recognised.”</p> <p>There seems something slightly sad about having to go to a music festival dressed as if you were heading to the western front. Does Radcliffe worry that he missed out on a normal teenagedom? He sighs. “I mean, maybe? I don’t know. I still got to go to Reading. I still had a great time. It’s one of those things that everyone wants to tell me I missed out on ... but I wouldn’t know, I’ve only lived my life this way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0tTp25txOE\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0tTp25txOE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Radcliffe starred in the video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0tTp25txOE\">Slow Club’s Beginners</a>, in which he stumbled around a London pub, playing air guitar in the part of someone drunk out of their mind. He says he doesn’t like to talk about his drinking problems, but admits that they did inspire his performance in that video: “Of course, it would be foolish to pretend it wasn’t.” Yet when I ask if that means he’d ever been in quite that much of a mess himself during his drinking days he fixes me with a surprisingly icy stare: “Why would you ask that when you know I don’t like to talk about it?”</p> <p>Radcliffe is still scarred by the fact he ever admitted to having an issue with alcohol. “If I had to give my younger self one piece of advice it would be, don’t talk about that in an interview,” he says. “Because I’ve answered questions on it for three or four years since. And it’s such an insignificant part of my life that everyone just wants to talk about.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b1b10ab-3268-4296-b1db-c4da2d5fb730\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408120657639/4ae73164-2f2d-48b5-91e3-2c8f7a64b65c-460x338.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Billy and Sarah Greene as Helen in The Cripple of Inishmaan\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Billy and Sarah Greene as Helen in The Cripple of Inishmaan Photograph: Johan Persson</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thing is, I say, the crux of what he was saying was refreshingly open and mature: that he was cutting out all drink and drugs to avoid the cliched route of the tortured child star. “Well, yeah,” he says. “That wasn’t really a matter of maturity, it was just something I needed to do.”</p> <p>It’s hard to argue with Radcliffe’s contention that everyone wants to talk about it. I wonder if he has ever Googled himself and seen the automatic search entries, but before I finish the question he’s started reeling them off: “Daniel Radcliffe alcoholic. Daniel Radcliffe gay. Daniel Radcliffe girlfriend,” he says, sighing as he does. Actually, I tell him, girlfriend is the top result these days.</p> <p>“Oh great – I’ll take that, as these things go. I’m pleased my girlfriend comes up before alcoholic or gay. When I first did that, I got really annoyed for about half a minute, until I tried a few other people’s names and I found out [gay] comes up after almost everyone if they’re a man, and even some women – Florence Welch had it, and I was like, really?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A86JGbBEaBk\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86JGbBEaBk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Maybe it’s a sign that a star has made it. “Probably. If people are speculating about your sexuality, then you’re doing OK,” he laughs, then says that these days he resists the temptation to self-Google as “it fucks you up. You shouldn’t be on there if you’re an actor. There’s a line in The Thick Of It – Googling yourself is like opening the door to a room full of people telling you how shit you are – and it’s exactly that. I first did it in my late teens and it was such a destructive thing for me to do.”</p> <p>These days, Radcliffe says smoking is his only remaining vice – and he does much less of that since he’s taken up running in preparation to play Seb Coe in the Olympics film Gold. Running, learning Japanese, 90-hour weeks ... does he put too much pressure on himself? He says not, so I ask him about a quote in which he said he sometimes heard voices telling him he was going to fail.</p> <p>“I was obviously not being literal,” he says. “But I think I have to apply that amount of pressure to myself because I want to do well. Now, maybe that’s not the healthiest way to function … but also, frankly, since the age of 20, all of the interviews I’ve done have involved people asking about my impending failure, and how I felt about the possibility of that. And so, when you’re confronted with that so often, you start to react to it. My own reaction was always to kick hard against it and think, fuck it, you might as well be bold now, make some interesting choices and see where that takes you.”</p> <p>Wherever that may be, you suspect there will be plenty more cameras around – and Radcliffe won’t be giving himself much of a break.</p> <p>• What If is released in the UK on Wednesday 20 August</p>","headline":"Daniel

But Luc Besson takes his uberfemme too far","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>When Scarlett Johansson achieves total consciousness in Luc Besson's sublimely ridiculous <strong>Lucy</strong>, she does not quip, like Bill Murray when granted the same Zen privilege by the Dalai Lama in Caddyshack, \"So I got that going for me, which is nice.\"</p><p>Probably because it isn't nice at all. It's hard to figure out quite what Besson is saying about the fact that most of us only use 10% of our brain's cognitive powers, but what we see on screen is a woman who, accidentally poisoned with a massive dose of a consciousness-expanding pharmaceutical, becomes steadily less human with each incremental increase in awareness, more indefatigable, then utterly infallible, and eventually completely uninteresting.</p><p>It's the reverse of the process Johansson undergoes in the far more captivating Under The Skin, which was a highly stylised examination of what it is to become human. But who do you root for if your heroine simply can't be bested? Has she no Achilles Heel? What is her Kryptonite? Where is the underdog in this scenario?</p><p>The underdog is everyone else: the people she knocks out, shoots, stabs, or glues to the ceiling with her hypertrophied atomic mind. When it turns out later on that she can change her hair colour by sheer mind-power, grow webbing on her hands and even travel through time, you just have to surrender and enjoy the ride.</p><p>Somewhere in this artificially flavoured, toxically calorific stick of Bessonian bubblegum there lurk pretensions to Kubrick's sci-fi crown. That's to say it starts and ends with an ape at the dawn of time, while its protagonist – as murderous as A Clockwork Orange's Alex DeLarge – has all the emotional sophistication of HAL 9000. But it's bogged down by oodles of exposition over here, and complete incoherence over there. For half the movie – as Lucy gets involved with the botched drug-smuggling plot that results in the super-drug, sewn into her stomach, bursting inside her – chemistry professor Morgan Freeman addresses a lecture hall in Rome so laboriously about consciousness-expansion that you wonder if he'll ever show up in the other half of the movie.</p><p>Said other half of the movie, stripped of all its guff about total awareness from the cellular level to the cosmic etc, is warmed-over Besson Redux: hot action-heroine in the mould of La Femme Nikita, Colombiana, The Messenger and Bandidas; grimy visuals; gratuitous against-the-traffic car chases and over-edited fight scenes; more armies of black-suited Asian villains than any five movies by John Woo; and fewer brains than 20 by Adam Sandler.</p><p>Worst of all, though, Besson's film does nothing to deserve  its primary asset: Johansson herself, who starts out interesting, and ends up being merely and boringly superhuman.</p><p><br /><a href=\"h//www.youtube.com/embed/MVt32qoyhi0?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\">Reading this on mobile?

One of the most recognisable stars in the world talks to Ed Cumming about marriage, money and his message of peace","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>When you say that you are meeting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jackie-chan\" title=\"\">Jackie Chan</a>, everyone grins. Friends, family, colleagues… nobody has a bad word to say. It’s a bit of a surprise when you consider that he found fame by falling over and beating people up. Then again, Chan is one of the most famous men on the planet, and really he has got there by making us smile. He doesn’t come to mind as quickly as a Clooney or a Cruise, but he is probably more recognisable than either. After Obama, the Pope, and a handful of footballers, it is hard to think of anyone who would have been seen by a bigger audience. During the nearly 50 years he has been working, hundreds of millions – perhaps billions – have been charmed by a Chan movie. He is the eternal cheeky underdog, with lightning fists and an open face that seems forever on the cusp of either tears or laughter.</p> <p>As he walks through the hotel where we are due to talk, there is a&nbsp;warm murmur of recognition from children and adults alike. In person he is ageless, slim with thick dark hair. “I can’t go out any more,” he says. “I used to love coming to London. I’d go to antiques shops and markets, walk around, go to the theatre. Now I just stay in the hotel. I eat in the hotel, sleep in the hotel, do interviews in the hotel. Then I&nbsp;leave. If I go out people follow me, surround me, shout, take pictures.</p> <p>“It’s better in Britain than in China. I tried to go shoe-shopping in China and the shop was surrounded by something like 20,000 people. They had to get the police special forces to create a cordon for me to run out through.”</p> <p>Is anywhere safe? Apparently not the South Pacific, where Chan filmed his most recent film, <em>Chinese Zodiac</em>, in Vanuatu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YtAbUU5jk8\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YtAbUU5jk8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>“The country only has a population of 25,000, mostly natives without shoes. But when I drove through, the whole village was on the street, shouting: ‘Jackie! Jackie!’ The only people they’d heard of were Sylvester Stallone and Jackie Chan.” He refers to himself often in the third person.</p> <p>“Sometimes I miss being more private. I&nbsp;used to wander around with my sunglasses on and people wouldn’t know it was me. But one day I woke up and the whole world knew Jackie Chan, from tiny children to old people. That was around 27 years ago. Since then it has been the same everywhere I go. So many people want a piece of Jackie Chan.”</p> <p>He is in town for two days to promote <em>Zodiac</em> and has flown from China, where he is filming <em>Dragon Blade</em>, an action film, with Adrian Brody and John Cusack. The following evening he will fly back. It’s an exhausting schedule for anyone, let alone someone who just turned 60.</p> <p>“I’ve wanted to retire for a long, long time!

I don’t think that’s marriage. A&nbsp;good husband works, and for my work I&nbsp;have to travel. Sometimes I won’t see my wife for months. Caring about my family doesn’t necessarily mean sitting on the sofa next to my wife every day.”</p> <p>Since 1982 Chan has been married to Lin Feng-jiao, an actor. They have a son, Jaycee, born in the same year and currently trying to break into the industry himself. From an affair in the late 90s Chan also has a daughter, Etta Ng, whom he only recently acknowledged. Previously he had shrugged off the infidelity as “something which all men do”, but last year he opened up when launching a&nbsp;movie with a plot about a father whose busy work life means he neglects his daughter. “It struck a chord with me,” he said, “because I&nbsp;neglected her for the longest time.”</p> <p>This attitude to parenting – and Chan’s work ethic – both seem to stem from his upbringing. Chan was born in 1954 in Hong Kong, with the christened name Chan Hong-San, meaning “born in Hong Kong”. His parents both worked at the French Embassy, his father Charles in the kitchen, his mother Lee-Lee as a cleaner. Chan senior taught his son kung fu, and when Jackie was seven he was enrolled at China’s strict Central Academy of Drama. There he would train obsessively, punching and kicking thousands of times a&nbsp;day. A few years later Charles and Lee-Lee moved to Australia, leaving their son to his studies.</p> <p>Later Chan would learn that his parents had abandoned previous families, his father leaving two sons, his mother two daughters, in mainland China when they moved to Hong Kong in 1949. His mother had also worked as an opium smuggler and was a legendary gambler. Charles had been a spy and a gangland figure, and had originally been called Fang Dao-long. “I was shocked,” said Jackie. “I thought he was just a cook.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9e96a21d-5929-4291-9c03-4dc42b8e1ded\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407926996661/cf62e4c8-e4ef-4bd0-b03f-577542a14754-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jackie Chan in the film Armour of God\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jackie Chan in the film Armour of God</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Independent from a young age, Chan honed his skills in dancing and singing, as well as martial arts, before starting out in stunt work. “I was so, so poor,” he says. “I was doing dangerous stunts for less than a pound a day.” A&nbsp;collapse in Hong Kong cinema led to a stint working in construction in Australia before Chan forged a tentative career in the movies. After the sudden death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bruce-lee\" title=\"\">Bruce Lee </a>in 1973 Chan seemed the obvious heir, but proved more versatile than the legend. In particular, he had great comic timing, as he proved in <em>Drunken Master</em> (1978), the film that made him a star.</p> <p>Over the next 10 years, various vehicles to establish Chan in the US sputtered while his career in Asia zoomed ahead. He established his own production company as well as an association for stuntmen. American success came in the 90s, through <em>Rumble in the Bronx</em> (1995) and then the <em>Rush Hour</em> (1998) series, as well as <em>Around the World in 80 Days (2004)</em>, with Steve Coogan. In Hollywood he usually takes a more traditional supporting actor, but on his own projects he often has near-total creative control, producing, writing, directing and starring in the films.</p> <p>“When I direct, the film is like my baby,” he says. “I have to make sure there is comedy but no dirty comedy, and a&nbsp;positive message. I&nbsp;like people to believe the stunts are real – it’s not like <em>Spider-Man</em> or <em>Iron Man</em> where a&nbsp;20-minute scene can be pure CGI. I&nbsp;only use a tiny bit of special effects. I want it to be believable, so where I used to do a triple kick, I now just do one. Eventually there will be no kicks. There has to be plenty of action, but not violence.”</p> <p>To the untrained eye, it seems like there is rather a lot of violence in his films, even if it tends to the cartoonish rather than the graphic. But Chan says the unthreatening brand of action is one reason why his movies tend to do well internationally. Given the size of the appetite for cinema in China – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/13/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-film-nicola-peltz-mark-wahlberg-michael-bay\" title=\"\"><em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> </a>has taken more there than it did in the US – Chan’s global outlook is highly in demand. Watching <em>Chinese Zodiac </em>it is noticeable how inoffensive the humour and the villains are.</p> <p>“I have a dilemma,” he says. “I love action, but I hate violence. There is so much violence in the world, from video games and from other movies. I want my movies to have a message of peace, and helping each other.</p> <p>“Education is so important. When I was growing up I believed a lot of traditional stuff because I was so dumb! I believed that the moon had magical powers, until I saw the guys go and walk on it. I&nbsp;almost admire the businessmen who can sell you anything: ‘it’s your birthday, have some cake, it’s your party, have some champagne, you’re hurt, have some tiger bone, you’re sick, have some bear bile. Even in kung fu, they say you can hurt someone with a 3in punch. It’s bullshit. You hurt someone by punching them. It’s a corruption. You have to keep working and keep learning. If children are playing video games or lying in bed they won’t.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54a2b8f7-ee8e-4947-b225-71f5bb3a5366\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407927314477/70b7b85b-7743-4231-9385-ec9c1b026bb1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jackie Chan as Boomer and Maggie Cheung as Barbara in Twin Dragons.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jackie Chan as Boomer and Maggie Cheung as Barbara in Twin Dragons</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chan is also a Unicef ambassador and supports wildlife charities as well as educational projects in China. “We have 26 schools and more being built. You have no idea how poor some of the places in China are until you see them. I wish I had more learning. When I was a kid I&nbsp;wanted to be a lawyer or an engineer or a doctor. You wish for your children what you didn’t have yourself, so I thought that’s what Jaycee would do. But he went into entertainment! He told my wife when he was 15, and she wept. ‘Why are you crying,’ I&nbsp;asked. ‘Because I’ve already lost my husband to this profession,’ she said.”</p> <p>In Asia, Chan is an industry. He has restaurants, theatres, a coffee business, a clothing label, a watch business. Boats, cars, planes, water, wine. He is the Hong Kong distributor for Segways. Plans are afoot for a Jackie Chan theme park in China, where he will house memorabilia from his career. “People come to me with these ideas. They want to break into the Chinese market, and ask if I can help, and if I like the idea I do.” He is also a pop star – recently he played a gig to 38,000 people. “More of a party for me,” he says. Neither he nor his manager claim to know what his total wealth is. “Nobody has time to check!” he says, but estimates put it at $130m.</p> <p>Chan’s status has brought other pressures. At times he has been criticised for supporting the Chinese government. He has suggested the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong are not necessarily desirable. But he seems to be happy with his hometown in 2014. Does he expect China to gradually withdraw the freedom of expression and assembly enjoyed by the former British colony? “No, life in Hong Kong is good,” he says. “It’s the same as it was before. My friends who moved away because they were scared of what would happen in 1997 [when Hong Kong rejoined China] are returning, but they are finding that they can’t afford a&nbsp;house any more. They are full of regret.</p> <p>“I don’t worry about money. If I&nbsp;want a car, a&nbsp;boat, a plane, I can buy it,” says Chan, who had plenty of Ferraris and Porsches when he was younger. “But it’s not interesting any more. Now I wear the same clothes every day – these trousers are from Gap. I only want money so I&nbsp;can give it away. The only thing I would like to buy is time. There isn’t enough.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0ea99131-b121-4416-b62d-f9f56ce8bba9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408103038641/4b8fa9ae-bc80-441b-876b-d6f0c4c56428-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jackie Chan shot for the Observer Magazine at the Corinthia Hotel in London SW1\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jackie Chan shot for the Observer Magazine at the Corinthia Hotel in London SW1 Photograph: Pål Hansen</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chinese Zodiac<em> is out now on Blu-ray and DVD, from Universal Pictures (UK)</em></p>","headline":"Jackie Chan: ‘I hate violence’","trailText":"Son of a spy and an opium smuggler, Jackie Chan has been making fast, furious and funny movies for half a&nbsp;century.
