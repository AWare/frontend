In the mid-80s, Jupitus traded under the name Porky the Poet, an act that he never brought to the Edinburgh fringe. Until now.</p><p></p><p><strong>So it's the man from </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v0dz\" title=\"\"><strong>Never Mind the Buzzcocks</strong></a><strong> reading poems?</strong><br />Not quite. Jupitus's introductions to the poems take up more time than the poems themselves. The show is two parts anecdote to one part verse.</p><p></p><p><strong>I want my money back.</strong><br /> Good luck with that. The show is part of the Free Fringe. Or as Jupitus introduces it, \"it's not worth the money you're not going to give me.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Sounds like a good deal.</strong><br /> It is. While Jupitus's poems – some old, some new – don't attain the standard of his professed heroes <a href=\"http://www.johnhegley.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Hegley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/mar/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ivor Cutler</a>, they're usually enjoyable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Examples please.</strong><br /> His 80s-era ditty <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhLRO-WcTBA\" title=\"\">They're All Grown Up in the Beano</a>, about the adult lives of comic characters, is of its era in all the right ways: punchy, chippy, funny. His White Hunter, Black Vest is a droll vignette about a \"kitchen Hemingway\" swatting a fly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sounds like a great act to support, say, Madness or Billy Bragg.</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Funny you should say that. That's what Porky the Poet did in the 80s, as Jupitus relates here in both anecdote and verse. On Supporting Madness is a rhyming horror story about an unhappy tour he undertook with Suggs and co.</p><p></p><p><strong>Name dropper.</strong><br /> And some. The central section of the show is his extended tale (too extended – Jupitus doesn't half string it out) of meeting McCartney and the Stones. It's a relief when he ends the preamble, and recites the poems.</p><p></p><p><strong>And how's the newer material?</strong><br /> So-so. It's hard to see what his poem about George Stephenson's rejected inventions (\"the all-purpose, dog-mounted Frenchman botherer\"  etc) has to do with the \"mouth-feel\" – relish of words – that Jupitus claims to love in poetry. But there's a sweet closer about his friendship with Hegley. There were meant to be songs, too, but a guitar string broke.</p><p></p><p><strong>Songs, too? Now that's what I call value for no money. </strong><br />Give this man the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/ts-eliot-prize-for-poetry\" title=\"\">TS Eliot prize</a> immediately.</p><p></p><p>• Box office: 0131 226 4380.

It was sunny, and it was overshadowed by the Olympics. While the rest of the world watched <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/usain-bolt-olympic\" title=\"\">Usain Bolt win the 100m</a>, some of us were at a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/pajama-men-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Pajama Men</a> gig in a tent in George Square. And why not? After all, the fringe is the Olympics of the comedy and theatre worlds, a contest between the brightest, most innovative and funniest performers that is even more competitive than the games. This&nbsp;year's event showed that participants can jump as high and run as fast as ever. Here's what we learned:</p><h2><strong>Capitalism hasn't killed the fringe</strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/30/stewart-lee-slow-death-edinburgh-fringe\" title=\"\">Stewart Lee's Guardian article</a> about the commercialisation of fringe comedy got everyone talking – and then the festival set about refuting its premise through sheer force of eclecticism. Two young Irishmen, their faces swaddled in polythene balaclavas, comedy-rapped about the IRA (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/10/rubberbandits-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Rubberbandits</a>). A comedian in a magenta leotard escaped his audience by leaping on to a&nbsp;passing bicycle (<a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/discover-ben-target\" title=\"\">Ben Target</a>). Neither of these remotely resembled Lee's dreaded \"Chipping Norton of the arts\". And yet <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/14/edinburgh-comedy-harry-hill-x-factor\" title=\"\">low sales figures for many acts</a> did lead to rumblings that the comedy bubble cannot inflate indefinitely.</p><h2><strong>We're cooling on the mainstream </strong></h2><p>And then came the most indie (and interesting) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/22/edinburgh-comedy-award-shortlist-announced\" title=\"\">Edinburgh comedy award shortlist</a> in years – one that celebrated infinite variety, and snubbed the mainstream. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/14/claudia-odoherty-review\" title=\"\">Claudia O'Doherty</a> was nominated for a malfunctioning \"difficult theatre\" romance between a Regency washerwoman and a modern-day New York cop; James Acaster for a show in which he hollered a Kettering Town football chant for five long minutes. The best comedy of the fringe, Pappy's touching and hilarious <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/22/pappys-last-show-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Last Show Ever</a>, was in the end pipped by the blissed-out American Phil Burgers, whose <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/23/doctor-brown-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">alter ego&nbsp;Doctor Brown</a> trampled over boundaries with his silent clown show.</p><h2><strong>Everyone likes a good magic trick</strong></h2><p>There were plenty of impossible feats, including a nail-up-the-nose stunt in the extraordinary Australian acrobatic show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/14/knee-deep-edinburgh-festival-assembly-george-square\" title=\"\">Knee Deep</a>. We'd also count: <a href=\"http://www.shonareppepuppets.co.uk/shonareppepuppets/Home.html\" title=\"\">Shona Reppe</a>, who worked a pubic-hair joke into a kid's show with such delicacy that no sane person would complain; the fact that so many people went up Arthur's Seat in the dark to experience NVA's runners-in-light-suits show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/10/speed-of-light-arthurs-seat-review\" title=\"\">Speed of Light</a> (and nobody died); and the chances of getting into the Assembly Rooms without a ticket (its bouncers make it our winner of the Least Welcoming Venue award). Shauna Macdonald deserves a mention, for performing Gary McNair's Born to Run on a running machine (while talking, too)But the Most Impossible Feat of All award goes to Rob Drummond's extraordinarily tense, moving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/bullet-catch-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Bullet Catch</a>, a multi-layered show about the illusions of theatre and the disillusionments of life, set around a potentially deadly magic trick.</p><h2><strong>Fringe theatre got very steamy</strong></h2><p>Perspiration is much admired in Edinburgh. This might be because some venues so resemble the Black Hole of Calcutta that even sitting down and doing nothing can be exhausting. Sit in the first two rows of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/edinburgh-festival-reviews/9458638/Edinburgh-Festival-2012-A-Clockwork-Orange-Pleasance-Courtyard-review.html\" title=\"\">all-male A Clockwork Orange at Pleasance</a>, and you risked a bath in the actors' sweat. But the show in which the sweat really rose and turned to steam was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Yael Farber's extraordinary production of&nbsp;Mies Julie</a>. Hot as hell in every way, but theatre heaven.</p><h2><strong>The comic revolution is on hold</strong></h2><p>The long-awaited rebirth of political comedy did not come to pass. But there were green shoots – most notably, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/07/chris-coltrane-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Chris Coltrane's Activism Is Fun</a>. A host of other comics put aside childish things to address stuff they actually cared about: for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/21/alfie-brown-comedy-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Alfie Brown</a> it was the stupidity of pop culture; for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/17/susan-calman-review\" title=\"\">Susan Calman</a> it was gay marriage; best of all was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/14/sara-pascoe-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Sara Pascoe</a>, looking at feminism through the lens of her 90s Essex adolescence.</p><h2><strong>Americans can be pretty funny</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Not for the first time, a clutch of exciting US acts arrived to contest our claim to global comedy pre-eminence. We encountered the dark imaginings of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/09/will-franken-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Will Franken</a>, dissecting American culture late at night in a Cowgate cellar; and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/20/kumail-nanjiani-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Kumail Nanjiani</a>, whose tales of beta-male self-preservation between Pakistan and the States were a sunny delight. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/16/eddie-pepitone-bloodbath-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Eddie Pepitone</a> brought his blue-collar rage and mid-life impotence to town (and was rewarded with an unlikely gossip column appearance when Hugh Grant <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/20/hugh-grant-turned-away-edinburgh-show?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">was barred from his show by overzealous bouncers</a>).</p><h2><strong>We approve of shows with snacks</strong></h2><p>Plenty of shows offered free food as an inducement. But who wants a stale croissant when Dan Bye's The Price of Everything at <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\" title=\"\">Northern Stage at St Stephens</a> (a superb new venue)offered free milk as well as advice on how to remake the world through acts of kindness. Even so, the award has to go to the <a href=\"http://housetheatre.org.uk/companies/hunt-darton/\" title=\"\">Hunt &amp; Darton Cafe</a>, a pop-up establishment of disarming eccentricity. Poems nestled on the menu alongside cakes; sometimes Christmas was celebrated all day.</p><h2><strong>Brevity is all</strong></h2><p>The international festival hosted Ariane Mnouchkine's four-hour epic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/24/les-naufrages-fol-espoir-review?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9383\" title=\"\">Les Naufrages du Fol Espoir</a>. Meanwhile, Spanish company Res de Res took just 11 minutes to astonish in their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/aug/13/edinburgh-festival-2012-fringe\" title=\"\">Remor</a>.</p><h2><strong>David Hasselhoff can't wear a kilt </strong></h2><p>Two disturbing sequences are seared indelibly onto the memory. The first came in ex-Star journo Rich Peppiatt's prank show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/one-rogue-reporter-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">One Rogue Reporter</a>, when he screened secret footage of a famous Fleet Street hack receiving a nude massage.

Like the Lib Dems, in fact, Coalition leaves us with little idea what it actually cares about. Instead, we're offered a sub-<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgrd\" title=\"\">Thick Of It</a> satire-cum-farce about a party leader holed up in his office as his unloved coalition government limps towards its final days in power.</p><p>The leader in question both is and isn't Nick Clegg. The parallel is obvious, and the show hijacks many of its laughs from real life. But Thom Tuck's unprincipled, highly strung and foul-mouthed Matt Cooper doesn't remotely resemble our sad-eyed, mild-mannered deputy&nbsp;PM.</p><p>The show's topicality is further undermined by yawning credibility gaps. We're asked to believe that, four years into government, and with their vote split when one of their MPs stands for re-election as an independent, the Lib Dems would remain competitive at a byelection. Later, Cooper/Clegg appears surprised to discover that a poll has found him unpopular with the public.</p><p>At this, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/aug/28/thom-tuck-review\" title=\"\">Tuck</a> (a stand-up comedian and member of the sketch troupe Penny Dreadfuls) performs another of his wannabe-Malcolm Tucker tantrums (\"you fucking disloyal treacherous waste of fucking space\"). They imply a lack of faith that the play can generate sufficient heat by itself – and they propel Tuck's performance into the realms of farce. There it is joined by Jupitus's wonderfully serpentine Tory grandee Sir Francis Whitford – a showstopping turn that can't quite obscure Jupitus's striking dissimilarity to every Tory who has ever lived. In Coalition, the men are all caricatures, and only the women – Jo Caulfield's beady Lib Dem chief whip, and Jessica Regan as Cooper's special adviser – play it for real.</p><p>The show isn't without its pleasures, which include some sharp lines (\"the truth about the Tory party is that they stand on a platform of 'government doesn't work', then get elected to prove it\") and a neat concluding twist that leaves Cooper even more stranded than he thinks he is. But when the lead character has so few redeeming qualities, it's hard to care about his trajectory. And, despite the title, there are no insights into coalition government, nor anything here that won't feel like a statement of the obvious to those who have looked on at Nick Clegg's fall from not-much-grace. Our terrible government cries out for a hard-hitting comic attack – but this is trite.</p>","headline":"Coalition – Edinburgh festival review","trailText":"This government cries out for a hard-hitting comic attack – but this is trite, writes Brian Logan","newspaperPageNumber":"15","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/16/1345126672599/Jo-Caulfied-and-Phill-Jup-004.jpg","wordcount":"444","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"394798959","starRating":"2","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6552112","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Brian Logan","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-17T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1788830","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-19T14:18:56Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/16/coalition-edinburgh-festival-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2012/aug/16/coalition-edinburgh-festival-review","tags":[{"id":"culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"culture/edinburghfestival","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburghfestival","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/brianlogan","webTitle":"Brian Logan","rcsId":"GNL234021","r2ContributorId":"15444","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749329408/BrianLogan.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733734715/BrianLogan.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>is comedy critic and arts writer for the Guardian.

Here are my top tips from deep inside Edinburgh – and a few pieces of advice for anyone approaching the festival for the first time","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T05:31:25Z","body":"<p>As I've said before, looking for great Edinburgh shows is like looking for a few needles in a haystack. That's the reason why I don't book out all my days in advance; what looks good on paper doesn't always turn out to be great in performance. It's best to book in a few shows in advance and leave some slots free every day for the show that reviews, word-of-mouth and Twitter (increasingly importantm this; you can find me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyngardner\">@lyngardner</a>) are bigging up. I find that talking to people in queues is invaluable for intelligence: it's amazing how often the same names of shows start to emerge.</p><p>But if you must book shows in advance (and I do understand the urge), here are a few tips. It's by no means definitive, and it will almost certainly start changing within a few days of the start of the festival, but here goes.</p><p>For quality experience and higher production values than you find in most shows on the Fringe, <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk\"><strong>the Traverse theatre</strong></a> is the place to start. I'm already hearing enthusiastic whispers about Mark Thomas: Bravo Figaro!, and Kieran Hurley's Beats is already proven, as is David Greig's The Letter of Last Resort and David Harrower's Good with People, which have both been seen previously but never together. Chris Goode's Monkey Bars is right at the top of my list, as is Simon Stephens's Morning, both of which deal with young people.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\"><strong>Northern Stage at St Stephen's</strong></a> has plenty of quality too</strong>. Much of this programme is already tried and tested: check out Will Eno's Oh, the Humanity, Unfolding Theatre's Best in the World, Third Angel's What I Heard About the World, Dan Bye's The Price of Everything, Jane Packman's A Thousand Shards of Glass and a new cabaret-style performance from RashDash called Ugly Sisters.</p><p>Things start to get very interesting as we <strong>head to <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a></strong>, which in its second year boasts a great lineup of the interesting and the frankly bizarre. Check out The Guild of Cheesemakers, Sleepwalk Collective's Amusements, Shu-Wing Theatre's Detention, Jenna Watt's Flaneurs, 24h (it really does last 24 hours), Song of a Goat's Songs from Lear and Macbeth, Fish and Game's Strange Hungers, Square Peg's Rime, and the poetry-based one-man piece Red, Like Our Room Used to Feel. I reckon this is the venue that could throw up some major surprises. </p><p>Things to look out for at the <strong><a href=\"http://www.thepleasance.co.uk \">Pleasance</a> venues</strong> include Les Enfants Terribles, with the first world war entombment story The Trench and The Two Worlds of Charlie F, about the realities of modern warfare; last year's Fringe darlings Curious Directive with After the Rainfall; Joel Horwood's latest, I Love Peterborough; the spyhole play about sex, Peep; Molly Naylor's My Robot Heart; Miriam Margolyes's Dickens' Women; Maurice's Jubilee featuring Julian Glover, Sheila Reid and Nichola McAuliffe; Pete Edwards' tale of difference, Fat; Phill Jupitus and others in the political comedy Coalition; and High Tide's Bottleneck. The site-specific Would Be Nice Though …, played in an office, sounds promising. On past form, Shams's Thin Ice should be worth checking out too. Tumble Circus's This Is What We Do for a Living looks great too: it won the best circus show award at the Adelaide Fringe. </p><p>If that little lot doesn't keep you going, <strong>the <a href=\"http://www.underbelly.co.uk \">Underbelly</a></strong> features the Old Vic New Voices plays, which include Strong Arm, Bitch Boxer, Chapel Street and more and should give a boost to new writing – thin on the ground in recent Fringes. Look Left Look Right are back with a new verbatim play about the BP oil spill, Nola, and Dancing Brick are back too with Captain Ko and the Planet of Rice, a tale of memory and loss. The Prize is a verbatim play exploring the sacrifices made for Olympic success, and Bye Bye World is an award winner from Holland about the desire to leave your life and start afresh. The real Lady Chatterley's Lover is revealed in Stephen Lowe's Just a Gigolo. Another interesting young company, Milk Presents, are back with A Real Man's Guide to Sainthood, the story of St George.</p><p>Away from the major venues, there are <strong>plenty of shows worthy of attention</strong>. I like the look of Rhum and Clay's A Strange Wild Story and Killing Time, which are both at <a href=\"http://www.bedlamfringe.co.uk\">Bedlam</a>, a venue I really love. Holly Rumble's One Minute Birdwatching in Princes Street gardens and <a href=\"http://hearapindrophere.com/\">Hear a Pin Drop Here</a> at Lauriston Halls both sound delightful. I'd check out The Elephant Man at the <a href=\"http://www.ifecosse.org.uk \">Institute Français d'Ecosse</a> and Donna Rutherford's Kin at the <a href=\"http://www.atgtickets.com/fringe\">Playhouse on the Fringe</a>. Alan Bissett's The Red Hourglass is at the <a href=\"http://www.nls.uk \">National Library of Scotland</a>. Forest Fringe isn't fully operational this year after the catastrophic loss of the Forest Cafe, but check up what it's up to <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk\">here</a>. Still Life: An Audience with Henrietta Moraes looks intriguing at the <a href=\"http://www.whitespace11.com\">Whitespace</a>. Short of cash but still want to see some shows? Try the <a href=\"http://www.freefringe.org.uk\">PHB Free Fringe</a>?</p><p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.arfringe.com\">Assembly Rooms in George Street</a></strong> is back in operation this year but under new management. Theatre highlights include Molly Taylor's NTS show Love Letters to the Public Transport System, Les Dennis as failed comedian Jigsy, Dave Florez's father and son drama The Intervention, the return of La Clique in Royale: The Queen's Selection, and the marvelous Liz Lochhead, queen of all she surveys, giving a daily audience in Making Nothing Happen.  </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cvenues.com\">C Venues</a> is a good place to look for student work</strong>, and some of it should be very classy – including One Academy Productions (otherwise know as the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland), which is reviving Sondheim's Company, directed by none other than ex-Traverse boss Dominic Hill. Also at C, check out The Flanagan Collective's new musical, Beulah, which is inspired by Blake, and Githa, about early 20th-century playwright Githa Sowerby. There's a new Belt-Up show, A Little Princess, and for politics and contemporary events try Presidential Suite, about the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, and The Economist, about the Anders Behring Breivik massacre.</p><p>Linda Marlowe is at the <strong><a href=\"http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk\">Gilded Balloon</a></strong> in Miss Havisham's Expectations. Here you will also find Stella Duffy directing Murder, Marple and Me, about the relationship between Agatha Christie and Margaret Rutherford; The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs (sadly sans Mike Daisey, but certainly still worth a look); the endlessly inventive improvisation piece The Showstoppers (there are some family matinees); Mel Giedroyc's debut play, Slice; and standup comedian Matthew Osborn's Shopping Centre, about a loner caught up in a riot.</p><p>At <strong><a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly George Square</a></strong>, look out for The People Show 121: The Detective Show, Re-Animator: The Musical, which sounds like good gory fun, and two shows from South Africa: And the Girls in Their Sunday Dresses and The Sewing Machine. Hangman should be worth seeing at Assembly Roxy, and I am looking forward to Irish company Cheerywild in Love All, about Ireland's first Wimbledon finalist, Dancing Brick's Perle, a comic-book tale of loss, the cabaret show Rubies in the Attic, and Sarah Daniels' Soldiers' Wives, about the women left behind when men go to war. Also check out Thread at Assembly St Marks.</p><p>There are undoubtedly masses of shows really worthy of attention that I've missed out, and there will certainly be some in this list that turn out to be shockers. I'll be sharing with you via the paper, the blog and Twitter what I think about the shows I'm seeing, and do please let us all know the shows you plan to see, the ones you rate – and, for everyone's sake, the ones we should all avoid.</p>","headline":"What to see: Edinburgh Fringe special","trailText":"<p><strong>Lyn Gardner:</strong> Why stick a pin in the Fringe brochure?

Unblinking, close-quarters nudity. Day one at Edinburgh had in previous years cast me as a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/aug/07/edinburgh-fringe-theatre-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\">reluctant hula dancer</a> (that was 2011's <em>Dance Marathon</em>) and a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/08/edinburgh-festival-abi-titmuss-simon-callow-theatre\" title=\"\">ranging urban troublemaker</a> (2010's <em>En Route</em>, asking of its participants trespass and minor acts of graffiti). This year, hardly off the train, only just done with the great annual question of whether to get a post-journey jacket potato from Tasty Tatties or a scotch pie from Auld Jock's, I was squatting down in a peep show-style booth trying to maintain a stern and professional expression while a candid play about sex unfolded six inches from my face.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/peep\" title=\"\"><strong>Peep</strong></a> was an odd production, a triptych of 20-minute playlets for which the creative team had constructed a new makeshift venue outside the Pleasance Courtyard. Four actors performed in a room little bigger than a double bed, an equatorial line of one-way glass ringing the space at waist height. Behind this sat audience members, each in their own tiny compartment. We were supposed to feel sordid, peering in on performers from our cubicles, and I did. This was especially so during the short entitled \"69\", a montage about the pleasures and problems associated with sex in modern Britain. At one point, without warning, the semi-clothed actors spun to the glass and hovered close, glaring – giving the audience some idea of what it's like, perhaps, for the luckless who've worked in such booths in real life.</p><p>Costume, again, was an impermanent thing across town in the white-walled confines of the Whitespace gallery. Here I saw <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/still-life-an-audience-with-henrietta-moraes\" title=\"\"><strong>Still Life</strong></a>, a one-woman show about Henrietta Moraes, Francis Bacon's famous model and muse. Sue MacLaine played Moraes, clad, sometimes, in a burgundy robe, more often in nothing at all. The audience were asked to cluster around with handed-out paper to draw pencil sketches.</p><p>\"I will hold this pose for one minute,\" said Moraes, interrupting the story of her life to stand straight-backed. \"I will hold this pose for eight minutes,\" she said later, explaining that Bacon had once asked for her to be photographed in just such a reclining position. The&nbsp;resulting pictures inspired his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jan/20/francis-bacon-nude-henrietta-moraes\" title=\"\"><em>A Portrait of Henrietta Moraes</em></a>, which sold this year at Christie's for £21m. The original photographs of Moraes, meanwhile, were sold on as porn in a Soho pub. \"Ten bob each.\"</p><p>Written by its gutsy performer MacLaine, <em>Still Life</em> interwove affectionate elements of biography with a more oblique sense of what it cost to be the human starting point for lasting art. Moraes was an alcoholic and&nbsp;heavy drug user. Bacon made her an immortal, but his close attention might have left behind trouble. At one point in the play Moraes begged her scribbling audience: \"Draw me now and see if you can get beyond almost… Show it back to me. Show me myself.\"</p><p>Still with the sheaves of sketch paper in my pocket, I went on to the entirely different <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/coalition\" title=\"\"><strong>Coalition</strong></a>, a political comedy at the Pleasance Dome. It presented a near-future Britain, the alliance between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats almost over, the Lib Dems in ruin. No Cameron, no Clegg, the key players here were fictional, the Lib Dems led by Matt Cooper (comedian Thom Tuck), a likable weakling so beaten down by \"coalition chess\" he can't really remember why there should be anything wrong with the idea of 48 new British nuclear plants. An enjoyable comic play, a little baggy at 90 minutes. Good but not great.</p><p>I still wanted great – that brilliant play, seen in its first few outings at the fringe, impressive enough to make you its missionary. Everybody! Everybody! Abandon your plans, get tickets! A single gem is enough, in week one, to make all the early-bird aimlessness and guesswork of the emergent festival worthwhile. On Thursday I saw two brilliant plays, back-to-back.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/after-the-rainfall\" title=\"\"><strong>After the Rainfall</strong></a> told a woozily complex story that strung together ideas about colonialism, revolution, social media and, somehow, ant hills; a story of parallel lives (a scientist, a spy, a sister, a student) lived out over a span of more than 70 years. The group behind the play, Curious Directive, staged a fringe hit last year, <em>Your Last Breath</em>, that was similarly layered, jumping about in time to tell a story about extreme human endurance.&nbsp;Its high point was a memorable dance sequence involving coloured string that&nbsp;criss-crossed the stage.</p><p><em>After the Rainfall</em> needed no similar centrepiece. Its flourishes were fainter: rolling landscape, seen from the window of a low-flying plane, summoned by a simple piece of canvas being manipulated under a spot. Such subtlety characterised script and performance, the unfairness of colonial Britain's artefact-pinching, for instance, inferred not in a lecture but in a believable conversation between strangers on a train. As well as vibrant design, a strength of this rising company is a talent for compactness. <em>After the Rainfall</em> achieved more in a single hour than would seem possible. I left heavy with its weight, eager to sit down and think it all through.</p><p>But no time. I was straight to the uppermost floor of the Underbelly venue on Cowgate to watch a third play in two days about sexual exposure. And <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/one-hour-only\" title=\"\"><strong>One Hour Only</strong></a> threatened, for a minute or so, to be as intense as <em>Peep</em>, as solemn as <em>Still Life</em>. In fact it was neither; instead, a terrifically simple love story, a modern <em>Brief Encounter</em>, staged in a brothel with the ticking away of costly minutes threatening the growing liking between prostitute Marley (Nadia Clifford) and customer AJ (Faraz Ayub). Marley and AJ are Londoners, clever and studying to better themselves, but young and naive enough to assume that their knowing, 21st-century ease with paid-for sex will never trouble them intellectually. Of course it does – the worse, over their 60 minutes together, as they begin to fall for each other.</p><p>Written by performance poet Sabrina Mahfouz (who last year impressed with dramatic monologue <em>Dry Ice</em>) the play did not spend much time decrying the sex trade. That has been done well, and often, at fringes past. Instead, Mahfouz made quiet study of the strange and even hostile places like-minds can find each other out. Staged in the uppermost room of the Underbelly, a hangar-like auditorium that is arguably the least cosy at the festival, <em>One Hour Only</em> achieved an intimacy that surpassed even those productions put on in a mocked-up peep booth, a life drawing class. The story, not the setting, forced audience proximity here. Everyone kept leaning in closer and closer.</p>","headline":"Edinburgh fringe theatre roundup","trailText":"<p><strong>Tom Lamont</strong> on a bracingly intimate first week at the Edinburgh festival fringe</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/3/1344025255117/Faraz-Ayub-and-Nadia-Clif-003.jpg","wordcount":"1130","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"394098231","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6501397","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Lamont","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1783121","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-25T23:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/05/edinburgh-fringe-theatre-roundup-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/2012/aug/05/edinburgh-fringe-theatre-roundup-review","tags":[{"id":"culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburgh-festival-2012","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","webTitle":"Liberal-Conservative coalition","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","references":[]},{"id":"society/prostitution","webTitle":"Prostitution","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/prostitution","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/prostitution","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/bacon","webTitle":"Francis Bacon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/bacon","references":[]},{"id":"culture/edinburghfestival","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburghfestival","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tomlamont","webTitle":"Tom Lamont","r2ContributorId":"28229","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/21/1321882147286/Tom_Lamont.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Lamont is a writer and commissioning editor for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/new-review\">Observer New Review</a>.

There is not a scrap of fat on it. It has a sustained simplicity, and doesn't try to disguise the pain or pretend what these astonishingly skilled performers are doing is easy.</p><p>Instead you watch mesmerised as muscles twitch and bodies shake: you actually glimpse the effort in their eyes. It doesn't detract from the experience but adds to it because it reveals them in all their humanity and reminds you they are like us despite their extraordinary skill and strength.</p><p>This is a show about relationships in which the performers are constantly pulling each other up and pushing each other down. They try to stand tall by clambering on each other's shoulders, reaching the sky. But an egg dropped from height into a bowl is a reminder that if they fall these performers will smash too. Catastrophe – or at least <a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1720/perfect-scrambled-eggs\" title=\"\">scrambled eggs</a> – is only a misjudged shift of weight or a mistimed balance away.

Easy: go up to him or her and say, \"tell us a joke.\" They don't like it – and not just because they get it every day of their lives. It's the idea that comedy is mainly about jokes: those trite little verbal subversions that kids tell one another in the playground; those facile constructions that bored desk johnnies swap by email to brighten a dull day.  Is that all it really is?</p><p></p><p>Well, no. But jokes remain a big part of what comics do, and how they're seen – and they exert an appeal that transcends the art of standup. How else do you explain the fact that yesterday's article about the TV station Dave's annual <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/21/edinburgh-fringe-funniest-jokes-revealed\" title=\"\">award for the funniest joke on the Edinburgh fringe</a> was the most-read piece on the Guardian website, or the huge number of one-liners swapped by readers below the line? Many of us enjoy watching standup comedy, sure. But all of us love a good joke.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/jan/17/tim-vine-one-liners\" title=\"\">What's the appeal</a>? On a superficial level, it's that one-liners are amusing, bite-sized and demand little effort to perform (even if they require plenty of effort to create). They're also comedy's commodity – we can take them away and use them elsewhere, and in doing so, enjoy the pleasure of being a comedian ourselves. (Being top dog; making people laugh.) More deep-rootedly, the best one-liners – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/12/emo-philips-edinburgh-festival\" title=\"\">Emo Philips has plenty of them</a> – demonstrate the truth of the George Orwell maxim that \"every joke is a tiny revolution.\" They take us out of our mundane reality, the one whose rules we think we know all too well. They show us how malleable those rules can be, how easily language can flip things upside down and reveal the world anew.</p><p></p><p>One or two of the jokes on Dave's shortlist are in that league. \"I was raised as an only child, which really annoyed my sister,\" runs Will Marsh's gag, which succeeds because it both punctures an expectation and implies a whole bizarre reality in only 12 words. Tim Vine's runner-up gag (\"Last night me and my girlfriend watched three DVDs back to back. Luckily I was the one facing the telly\") shows us how wonky the world would be if we everything we said was the literal truth. (I hope <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/feb/17/comedy-leicester-festival-milton-jones\" title=\"\">Milton Jones</a>, who has been telling the same joke for years, is basking in reflected glory.)</p><p></p><p>Others on the list are weak, which partly explains the feelings of underwhelm I  – you too? – experienced on encountering the shortlist. Is this really the best that comedy can do? But that's the problem with this new annual award. It's a welcome addition to the fun of the festival, but by suggesting that the immeasurable range of Edinburgh comedy can be captured by these few words on a printed page, it sells the wild world of comedy short. Even one-liner merchants – from Tommy Cooper to Tim Vine – are far funnier onstage than when quoted out of context. The actual joke is a small part of how they make us laugh. And what Dave's award occludes is how the funniest moments in comedy usually have nothing to do with a \"Have you heard the one about...?\"-style laugh-line.</p><p></p><p>Verbal wit plays a minor part in most of my biggest laughs on the fringe. An eastern European puppet performing Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights in the late-night cabaret <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/boris-sergey-s-vaudevillian-adventure\" title=\"\">Boris and Sergey's Vaudevillian Adventure</a>.

Her show is called, er, Fat Whore.</p><p><strong>Enchanté.</strong> <br />You won't be. Levine's autobiographical set largely comprises outrageous tales from \"adult\" retail, plus a few anecdotes about her relaxed attitude to parenting.</p><p><strong>Such as? </strong><br />There's the time she avenged a slight by pissing in the sugar bowl of another local mom.

But it's hard to see her gross-out humour and glib take on rape and abortion prospering without a rowdier and less beady audience than she got here.</p><p>Box office: 0844 693 3008.

A comment under today's review of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/09/after-the-rainfall-review?newsfeed=true\">After the Rainfall</a> from someone who sat at the back of the venue in Pleasance Dome and was rewarded by seeing almost nothing is a reminder that, beyond the Traverse, very little work on the fringe is seen in ideal conditions. It's often one of the reasons why new writing in particular fares badly on the fringe, although the two plays I've seen so far in the <a href=\"http://https://www.underbelly.co.uk/new-voices-edinburgh-2012 \">Old Vic New Voices season</a> at Underbelly – B*tch Boxer and One Hour Only (both in Big Belly) – suggest that when the writing is strong and the design simple you can pull it off.</p><p>I'd like to hear your tips for Edinburgh's best and worst venues. I've been telling people who are going to see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review?newsfeed=true\">Mies Julie</a> at <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly Hall</a> on the Mound that it is well worth getting to the venue early and queuing to get a seat near the front, and quite frankly I'd prefer never to see another theatre show in the <a href=\"http://www.arfringe.com\">Assembly Rooms</a> Ballroom, although the dynamic is fine for comedy. The demonstration room at <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a> (where I saw the powerful and heartfelt We Are Chechens! and The Shit) is hugely atmospheric, but the acoustics are poor, and in Pleasance Two sound from the courtyard frequently drifts across the stage, a problem that affects many venues. It's been a good decision by <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\">Northern Stage at St Stephens</a> to steer clear of the main church space, which even in its Aurora Nova glory days presented enormous difficulties for artists and audiences.</p><p>The difficulties of venues have always made me wonder why more artists don't take their shows outside and use the natural beauty of Edinburgh as backdrop. Of course that's exactly what the Edinburgh international festival is doing with <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">NVA's Speed of Light</a>, which nightly takes 850 people up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat,_Edinburgh\">Arthur's Seat</a> in the dark. I'd like to have seen the health and safety report on that. </p><h2>Bad behavior</h2><p>Talking of Speed of Light brings us on to bad behavior in the theatre, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/may/08/the-new-cultural-rules-audience\">a subject we have often covered</a>. At least standing up and shouting \"rubbish\", as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/09/orla-o-loughlin-edinburgh-festival?newsfeed=true \">happened at a performance of Morning</a> at the Traverse earlier this week, shows some kind of engagement. It was less obvious on Thursday night on Arthur's Seat, where NVA's participatory artwork was taking place, as it will for the rest of the month. In the briefing before we set off, people were asked not to talk too much and keep their voices low, not to take photographs and to turn off their mobile phones. What happened? People talked incessantly all the way up and down the mountain, took photos and called their friends on their mobiles: \"Hey, you'll never guess, it's 11pm and I'm on Arthur's Seat.\" Whoopee!  </p><h2>Quote of the day</h2><p>Accusing, weary man to girlfriend in the Underbelly bar: \"OK, I'll come and see another show, but not if we have to queue again to buy the tickets and to get into the show. You said doing the fringe would be fun, but I'm beginning feel like a pre-glasnost East German during a food shortage.\"</p><h2>What to see: my weekly theatre tips</h2><p>Right, it's an abbreviated What to see this week because the focus is very much on Edinburgh, where the <a href=\"http:// www.eif.co.uk \">international festival</a> opens tomorrow. Shows this week include Grzegorz Jarzyna's 2008: Macbeth which is set in a Middle East state, and Christoph Marthaler's My Fair Lady-inspired Meine faire Dame, about linguistic confusion. On the fringe, my recommendations so far are: Mies Julie at Assembly Mound; Knee Deep at Assembly George Square; Caesarian Section – Essays on Suicide and The Shit at Summerhall; Bullet Catch, Blink, Morning and Bravo Figaro! at the Traverse; The Curious Scrapbook of Josephine Bean and The Ballad of Pondlife McGurk at the Scottish Book Trust; I Heart Peterborough at Pleasance Courtyard; The Price of Everything, The Ugly Sisters and Oh, the Humanity (I saw this prior to the festival) at Northern Stage at St Stephens; One Hour Only and B*tch Boxer at Underbelly.
