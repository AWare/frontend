He's the first and only one I've been with, and I've never regretted connecting his life to mine … no matter how bad it gets, do not give up. Live for love!</p></blockquote><p>This snippet is from a letter by Andrei, 22, one of thousands posted to an online forum called \"<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/katiezavadski/in-russia-breaking-the-law-to-tell-gay-teens-it-gets-better\">Children 404: We Exist</a>,\" a year-old community for queer teens and adult allies on Russia's popular <a href=\"http://vk.com/\">vk.com</a>, as well as Facebook (the name comes from the online \"404 not found\" error code). Most posts to the site are coming-out stories, others detail battles with depression or trouble with family, and some are sweet confessions about crushes and first loves. </p><p>Last week the young journalist who launched the site, Lena Klimova, <a href=\"http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2014/01/31/russian-journalists-face-prosecution-for-gay-propaganda/\">was charged</a> with violating the country's new ban on \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.\" A trial date will be set soon, and if Klimova is found guilty, and she almost certainly will be, she'll be fined and the \"Children 404\" page on <a href=\"http://vk.com/\">vk.com</a> will be shut down. On her Facebook page, Klimova described the consequences: \"If it will be closed, LGBT teenagers will lose the only place where they can openly speak about themselves and receive advice they need to live. It will be a catastrophe.\" </p><p>This is how the work of trying to make LGBT people in Russia disappear is playing out: a bureaucratic battle against websites, against journalism, against free speech, and against storytelling. It's a battle against millions of Russians and it's a depressing spectacle to watch, even more so when Russian officialdom declares victory preemptively. In the Olympic city of Sochi the mayor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25909656\">recently told the BBC</a> that his town is blessedly gay-free. Given that Sochi has historically been one of the more gay-friendly resort towns in Russia, and is home to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7cecc80e-8a87-11e3-9c29-00144feab7de.html#axzz2sCxhryr4\">a couple of gay bars</a>, it's a curious assertion. </p><p>The problem with trying to disappear people who refuse to disappear is that their stories find a way of getting told. That's the case with Andrei Tanichev and Roman Kochagov, owners of a thriving gay friendly cabaret in Sochi. Andrei and Roman, along with dozens of other Russian LGBT men and women, opened up about their relationships in a new book publishing next week, in English and in Russian, called <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/gay-propaganda/\">Gay Propaganda: Russian Love Stories</a>. The book is edited by myself and award-winning Russian journalist Masha Gessen. </p><p>As Andrei told us in an interview:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We're completely open about our lifestyle. Not only our parents, but also the municipal administration is aware of who we are … right before the Olympics, they've even paid special attention to us. They call and ask whether we've had the menu translated into English, whether we've been training our staff to speak foreign languages. My mother lives with us and helps us out a lot. I told her I was gay when I was eighteen. My brother knows as well. He works at our club.</p></blockquote><p>In a society where the government has made any and all positive or sympathetic portrayals of LGBT life illegal, stories like this say something elemental: we exist. To set the record straight, next week we'll be mailing copies to the mayor of Sochi as well as the Russian lawmakers who authored the \"propaganda\" ban. The Russian version of the book will be available as a free download for anybody who wants it, and we're working with partners to get print books to Sochi, and to cities across Russia.</p><p>There's a reason stories like this are threatening. The propaganda law comes out of a shrewd analysis by conservatives about the powerful role that culture has played in softening attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Reactionaries in Russia, and <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/18/20546485-the-rainbow-belongs-to-god-anti-gay-us-pastor-sets-sights-on-sochi-olympics\">in the US</a>, have taken note of how reporting, literature, television, theater and film have helped normalize the idea for the mainstream that yes, LGBT people exist, they're mostly just like you and me, and you probably have at least one in the family. Going after a relatively small target, like the \"Children 404\" online support community, may seem absurd, but it comes from an awareness that stories and portrayals and reporting change hearts and minds (or in the parlance of anti-gay activists, \"recruit\" vulnerable young people in to the gay lifestyle). The fact that these are young people sharing stories with each other doesn't seem to matter under the law, this kind of \"propaganda\" must be nipped in the bud wherever it takes root. The Russian government is waging an information war, and up to now, they're winning it.</p><p>That's why a number of the people interviewed in Gay Propaganda have chosen to leave Russia, as has my co-editor Masha Gessen, who moved her entire family from Moscow to New York last month for fear that the government may crack down even further once the Olympics come and go, with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/world/europe/russia-new-gay-law/\">a law to take children away</a> from gay parents. A notable consequence is an increasingly vocal emigré community of LGBT Russians in big cities like New York, many of whom have been on the front lines of protests against the Russian government or corporate sponsors of the Olympics. </p><p>But the war footing of the government has also mobilized LGBT Russians inside Russia in equally remarkable and unprecedented ways. The week after the Sochi Olympics, activists are hosting a first ever <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/europe/open-games-in-moscow-to-test-an-antigay-law.html\">LGBT sports competition</a> in Moscow, the \"Open Games.\" Last week a Russian actor who had publicly called for gays to be put \"<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/ivan-okhlobystin-russian-scrubs-gay-people-burn-alive-ovens\">all he gays alive into an oven</a>,\" was slapped with <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/activist-takes-sitcom-star-to-court-for-saying-gays-should-be-put-in-ovens/493590.html\">a lawsuit by a prominent gay rights activist</a>. And it's fair to assume, if the government is able to shut down the \"Children 404\" site, a similar service or forum will pop up in its place, getting the simple message across in one way or another: we exist.</p>","headline":"As the Sochi Olympics commence, learn the stories of Russians like Andrei Tanichev and Roman Kochagov","trailText":"<p><strong>Joseph Huff-Hannon:</strong> Though homosexuality is illegal, and LGBT activism is \"propaganda\", we have one simple message: we exist</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mevt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/1/1378043027821/Russian-gay-rights-activi-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/1/1378043027821/Russian-gay-rights-activi-003.jpg","wordcount":"979","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428837732","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Joseph Huff-Hannon","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2037573","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:15:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/sochi-olympics-gay-rights-will-prevail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/sochi-olympics-gay-rights-will-prevail","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics-2014","webTitle":"Winter Olympics 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","references":[]},{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"profile/joseph-huff-hannon","webTitle":"Joseph Huff-Hannon","r2ContributorId":"37054","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391107154982/Joseph-Huff-Hannon_v2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Joseph Huff-Hannon is an activist and award-winning writer who has been published in The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, and elsewhere.

Those raised on <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/238441/Gone-with-the-Wind\">Gone With The Wind</a> grew up and figured out that, cripes, they'd been cheering for slavery every Christmas, and against the \"dirty Yankees.\"</p><p>Now here is <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/downtonabbey/\">Downton Abbey</a>, halfway through its fourth season, with Lady Mary Crawley emerging from grief and social change in the air, shattering assumptions and upsetting old orders. It is time to declare one's allegiances and, for many of us, years of living with the Crawleys have pointed them in a singular direction.</p><p>Most TV dramas are assumed to be liberal, because liberals gravitate towards jobs in TV. The recent and enjoyable flap in the British press about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/13/dailymail-sherlock\">a left wing</a> bias in <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/sherlock/\">Sherlock</a> – triggered by this week's episode in which a Scandinavian version of Rupert Murdoch is briskly and approvingly executed by the hero – is just one example.</p><p>Look at <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/call-the-midwife/home/\">Call the Midwife</a>, proselytizing shamelessly for European socialized health care. And the soon to be aired UK import <a href=\"http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2013/10/31/ian-mckellen-gets-vicious-pbs\">Vicious</a>, in which Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi force yet more gay propaganda down the throats of a nation's exhausted heterosexuals. And what was <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/the-wire#/\">The Wire</a> if not five seasons-worth of excuses for criminal behaviour?</p><p>Downton by contrast has always been on the right. Tom the chauffeur had his Irish nationalist phase, which one understands to have been rather silly of him. The show favors a brand of Conservative paternalism embodied by Lord Grantham, who is a good man, and Mary, who, let's face it, is a proto-Thatcherite.</p><p>\"His forebears have been tenants since the reign of George III,\" said her father mildly, a few episodes ago, when she urged him to evict a tenant farmer.</p><p>\"Be that as it may,\" said Mary, \"the rent's not been paid for ages …\"</p><p>I enjoy Downton. It's silly and suspenseful, even at this stage when it looks expressly made for export: a moving vista of commemorative plates of the English countryside and the figurines arranged upon it.</p><p>It doesn't matter that at least half the cast seem to be reading from cue cards. In fact, it only adds to the fun trying to figure out who among Bates, Carson, Molesly and Anna is doing the least amount of acting, made up for, of course, by Maggie Smith, who is acting for all of them. (Like an Olympic athlete, Dame Maggie is a practitioner of the almost impossible to pull off quadruple-take, which there should be a term for but isn't.)</p><p>What's interesting is the extent to which, after four seasons, one is immersed in the values espoused by the show.</p><p>For example: it really is too bloody much to expect the Dowager Countess to call Branson, Tom. Once a chauffeur etc.</p><p>When Lord Gillingham's valet, Mr Green, invites Anna to call him by his own name, not his master's, she replies that Carson would be horrified and they follow the old ways at Downton. Anyone tempted to sympathize with Mr Green's point, is rebuked when he turns out to be a rapist.</p><p>And now, in this latest episode (on the US not UK schedule), here is Charles Blake, envoy of the Liberal prime minister and guest at Downton, where, he explains, he will be stationed while touring the grand old estates of England, engaged in some sort of viability study.</p><p>Lady Mary is horrified and there it is; the moment you find yourself thinking, good Lord! Why is the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/george_david_lloyd.shtml\">Lloyd George government</a> harassing these poor people? What is this man's problem? Why can't the aristocracy be left unmolested to steward the great monuments of England through the 20th century? Give them a subsidy, for god's sake, it's national heritage!</p><p>Oh. Wait.</p><p>\"Mr Lloyd George,\" says Charles Blake smugly, \"is more concerned with feeding the population than rescuing the aristocracy.\" Lady Mary fairly hisses at him, and for a second, one is hard pressed not to side with her.</p><p>The writer, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/02/03/julian-fellowes-downton-abbey-season-4-interview_n_4717795.html\">Julian Fellowes</a>, does all this knowingly and with a degree of campness, of course, not least because Blake and Mary are clearly designed for each other and we will, presumably, all learn a valuable lesson about compromise in the end.</p><p>But one's sympathy for the Crawleys is so advanced at this stage, they could probably roast a villager over a bonfire and we'd think quite right, ungrateful serf had it coming.</p><p>Lloyd George paid for the creation of an early version of the welfare state in part by raising taxes on the aristocracy, starting with land taxes in 1909, continuing on through the First World War and in 1919, <a href=\"http://thisalreadyhappened.com/2013/02/09/downton-abbey-the-reluctant-landlord/\">doubling death duties on estates worth more than £2mn, to 40%</a>. This crippled a lot of aristocratic families and resulted in the selling off of many large estates.</p><p>A way of life came to an end, something Downton is nostalgic for in a way that is outlandish in the current TV landscape and, for left-wing fans of the show, constitutes a sort of political tourism.</p><p>I would, therefore, counsel right-wing critics of Sherlock to keep calm and enjoy the vacation from themselves, as those on the left do every week at Downton, now facing it's bleakest hour at the hands of the bureaucrats and the scourge of modernity. Lady Rose kisses a black jazz musician in the kitchen. Lady Grantham wants to buy a fridge. And Lady Edith gets a middle class boyfriend, who promptly goes missing in action.</p><p>That's the lower orders for you, I'm afraid. Thoroughly flighty.</p>","headline":"Downton Abbey: my weekly dose of conservative values","trailText":"<p><strong>Emma Brockes:</strong> After a four-season immersion in the show's right-wing political values, why not enjoy the silliness instead of fighting it?</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfpp","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381322664293/Downton-Abbey-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381322664293/Downton-Abbey-003.jpg","wordcount":"920","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429012695","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Emma Brockes","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038984","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:49:24Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2014/feb/06/downton-abbey-conservative-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2014/feb/06/downton-abbey-conservative-politics","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog","webTitle":"Emma Brockes' blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/downton-abbey","webTitle":"Downton Abbey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp;

The rail link to London is of limited concern","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-06T13:02:47Z","body":"<p>Before the railway line between Cornwall and London was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/05/storms-rain-uk-dawlish-floods\" title=\"\">undermined by storms yesterday</a>, I hadn't given masses of thought to our obsession with the weather. I've never really given much of a toss for what the actual weather is doing in Cornwall. Rain, sun, mizzle (a Cornish phenomenon somewhere between rain and drizzle) … I honestly don't care. I love a walk on <a href=\"http://www.gwithian.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Gwithian </a>in the pissing rain as much as I do in the sun.</p><p>For me, and thousands of other surfers, the real weather fascination has always been what's going on in the big blue expanse right on our doorstep that covers 20% of the earth's surface – the Atlantic Ocean. I've probably watched thousands of low pressures brew over 25 years, and waited patiently for the surf to lash our shores days later. Once one storm's gone, you're waiting impatiently for the next.</p><p>Early January saw a super storm smash our shores. We eagerly watched the weather charts online where the typical blues and greens which informed us of swell size, were swapped for reds, blacks and eventually whites, each colour a greater magnitude of wave size.</p><p>This week, another huge weather system hit Cornwall, with the mother of all storms reportedly heading our way this weekend. The storm called Brigid that hit us on Wednesday gave us such an incredible battering overnight that there was only one word for it – it's same word that the shipping forecast uses to describe such sea conditions – \"phenomenal\".</p><p>And, as I have already mentioned, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/05/uk-storms-live-updates\" title=\"\">it destroyed the railway link to London</a> that so many rely on. We're stranded.</p><p>Within minutes the Twitter conversation turned to the subject of infrastructure. One of the two main road routes to London, the A303,  is impassable and flights from Newquay , are threatened with closure. I'm not even sure if you can get on a plane to London now.</p><p>Then I spotted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LydiaSKent\" title=\"\">the tweet</a>, the one I had been waiting for: \"The bad news is Cornwall is cut off from England. On the other hand, the good news is Cornwall is cut off from England\". Wuh! Hell up!</p><p>You see, we've always felt different in Cornwall. Not just cut off. The majority of us don't feel especially English, which really winds some outsiders up because they think it means we don't like them. It's why squillions of people come to Cornwall every year! Our history, our language, our culture, our sports, our people … we're Cornish before we're anything else. Without that rail link, we may well be cut off, but because communities pull together for each other, we're even more Cornish now.</p><p>But does the rest of the country actually give a shit? Have they ever? Someone said to me recently that the further you get away from London, the poorer the country becomes. It's certainly the case that some parts of Cornwall are classed as \"deprived\"?  The <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Social Justice</a> recently commissioned a study into areas of the country which Westminster policymakers have simply forgotten about. What they found in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/04/hidden-cornwall-beaches-poverty-domestic-violence\" title=\"\">Camborne, Pool and Redruth</a> startled them</p><p>Another startling fact: central government spending on arts and culture in the capital amounted to £69 per resident in 2012-13, compared with £4.60 per person elsewhere in England. It was even less in Cornwall.</p><p>So, what are the options?</p><p></p><p>• Dave Cameron stops visiting the beautiful Port Isaac for his holidays and has a look around the real Cornwall. I'll show him. He can buy me a bleddy pasty since he started taxing them though! Maybe it'll inspire him.</p><p>• Get the Duke of Cornwall involved. I'd love to know his opinion. The Channel Islands, for example, have a great personal relationship with the Queen. It's a partnership, with the Queen and the islands working together and being mutually beneficial.</p><p>• A Cornish Assembly. In a nutshell, bring devolved powers from central government into the hands of the people of Cornwall. The Scottish referendum takes place this year and the Welsh Assembly is working for a \"fairer and more prosperous Wales\". Would Cornwall do a better job managing her own affairs? I think we could.</p><p>• Nothing changes. Dave Cameron will keep on holidaying in beautiful Kernow (Cornish for Cornwall), Cornwall's gross-valued-added continues to fall and our infrastructure decays further, the storms will keep on rolling in. I'll keep surfing whatever the weather and we'll scrap on, drifting even further away.</p>","headline":"Proper job!

Wives and lovers get more attention than female politicians","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-06T12:33:02Z","body":"<p>And so to the sausage fest that is the Tory party. I may be putting words into Ed Miliband's mouth, but I think we can go as far as to call it that, can we not? In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/05/ed-miliband-david-cameron-old-boys-network\" title=\"\">pointing out</a> the startling absence of women on the \"all male frontbench laid before us\" at this week's prime minister's questions, and by taunting Cameron with \"I guess they didn't let women into the Bullingdon Club either\", Miliband said what many women had been thinking for months now. Yes, the Tories have a \"women problem\" (the problem being, of course, that they have sod all women). However, as any woman knows, the term \"woman problem\" is usually employed euphemistically to refer to anything vagina or menstruation related, and is usually used by nervy men. As such I'd ask that we begin replacing the term with \"sausage fest\" with immediate effect. The Conservative party is many things, but on its period it is not – how could it be?</p><p>\"Sausage fest\" is a far more fitting term. Indeed, sausage was one of the first nouns I actually heard used in relation to the coalition government, as I awoke, head pounding, on the morning of Friday, 7 May 2010. I gained consciousness that spring morning to the plummy sounds of Boris Johnson's chilling statement that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8668036.stm\" title=\"\">\"the meat in the [coalition] sausage has to be Conservative</a>\". Jeremy Paxman gamely continued with this macho analogy, inquiring as to whether it might be said to be a chipolata or a cumberland. Yes: the first event I witnessed when waking to the dawn of a new political era involved two privileged, middle-aged white men making phallocentric jokes on national television. Start as you mean to go on, guys.</p><p>But then we're fascinated by political sausages, aren't we? Just look at the top stories of the past few weeks. First we're told that François Hollande's been making a pig's ear of it with a younger woman behind the French first lady's back, then Liz Hurley's rumoured ex Tom Sizemore (a more fitting name for inclusion in this column is surely not possible) momentarily conned showbiz gossip mongers everywhere by alleging that she and Bill Clinton had had a private-jet-based affair. It <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/10621303/Liz-Hurley-and-Bill-Clinton-affair-was-all-made-up-admits-Tom-Sizemore.html\" title=\"\">turned out to be rubbish</a>, of course, but not before some pretty blue fan fiction had appeared online imagining the tryst in great detail. It shows how the power-is-an-aphrodisiac narrative still captivates us. Hurley's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/liz-hurley-denies-yearlong-affair-with-bill-clinton-after-sensational-us-media-reports-9109384.html\" title=\"\">2010 comments</a> on Cameron and Clinton (\"I think he's gorgeous. Super-sexy!\" she said of the former, adding: \"Powerful folk can be sexy … I adore Clinton\") were wheeled out as evidence of her status as politician shagger extraordinaire. Never mind that the story was bunkum – it cemented people's existing preconceptions about 21st-century gender roles.</p><p>And let's not forget <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/03/wendi-deng-note-tony-blair\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair's allegations</a> that Wendy Deng, ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, has been lusting over ripped war criminal and hunk of meat Tony Blair. It's cringe-making stuff, to be sure. And yet, where powerful men are concerned, there's an expectation there that they will have attractive, nubile women lusting after them. This is a society in which the apparent existence of an archetypal power dynamic between a man and a woman still garners more media exposure than any female politician. Furthermore, unless a lady politician is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/09/should-mps-reality-tv-shows-penny-mordaunt-splash\" title=\"\">sporting a swimsuit on national television</a>, male politicians' wives are considered far more interesting, whether it's because they typify a demure, composed feminine archetype (SamCam) or appear to reject it (Sally Bercow). Indeed, the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100258140/sally-bercows-latest-scandal-means-john-bercow-has-to-go/\" title=\"\">\"get your wife under control\" tone</a> to reporting about Bercow makes me sick to my stomach.</p><p>\"I'm more than just a dress,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2431155/Labour-Party-Conference-2013-Ed-Miliband-Justine-Thorntons-cheesy-photo-stunts.html\" title=\"\">said Justine Thornton</a> at the Labour party conference last year, foreshadowing the party's renewed emphasis on issues of gender equality. Not in this country, I'm afraid, Justine, but still, you have a better chance than you would in the Tory party. As David Cameron desperately tried to point out at PMQs, they may have had some ham, once, in the form of Margaret Thatcher, but they're still just a bunch of male chauvinist porkers, and many of us are sick of sausages. In fact, I wish all the little piggies would just stay at home. It's time for some nut roast.</p>","headline":"I'm sick of politics being a sausage fest","trailText":"<strong>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett: First thoughts:</strong> The 'women problem' identified by Ed Miliband goes wider than the Tory frontbench.

Here we have yet another frightening example: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/afghanistan-law-victims-violence-women\" title=\"\">a new law</a>, passed by both houses of the Afghan parliament and waiting for President Hamid Karzai's ratification, would prohibit the questioning of relatives of an accused perpetrator of a crime, effectively eliminating victim testimony in cases of domestic violence.</p><p>In article 26 of the proposed change in the criminal prosecution code, those prohibited from testifying would include: husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and descendants of those relatives up to the second generation. Doctors and psychiatrists would also be banned from giving evidence.</p><p>This proposed law is particularly troubling in a country where violence against women is endemic and, most commonly, is at the hands of a relative. In a <a href=\"http://www.globalrights.org/site/DocServer/final_DVR_JUNE_16.pdf?docID=9803\" title=\"\">2008 study</a>, Global Rights found that 87% of Afghan women will experience some form of violence in their lifetime; 62% experience multiple forms of violence, including forced marriage and sexual violence.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.womenforafghanwomen.org/\" title=\"\">Women for Afghan Women</a> (WAW) can attest to these findings. Over 90% of the nearly 10,000 women and girls we have served since 2007 have been victims of domestic violence. Our clients have been raped, sold, beaten, starved and mutilated – primarily at the hands of a family member, or in some cases, multiple family members.</p><p>Should Karzai sign this law into effect, justice for these women would be virtually impossible. Not only would they be barred from testifying against family members who committed crimes against them, any family member who witnessed the crime would be barred as well.</p><p>Under the proposals, WAW clients, such as 15-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/sahar-gul-afghanistan-tormentors-free\" title=\"\">Sahar Gul</a> who was kept in a basement and tortured by her in-laws, would have been robbed, not only of justice, but of the opportunity to reclaim her power and testify against her tormentors. Furthermore, the doctors who treated her bloodied, malnourished, and burned body would also be barred from testifying. Sahar Gul's in-laws are serving a five-year prison sentence for torturing her. Had the new measure been law in 2012, her in-laws would likely be free to torture and abuse more women.</p><p>Other clients, such as 16-year-old Naziba who was raped by her father, would be left with no other option but to live with the abuse. At Naziba's rape trial, her mother and uncles courageously testified against her father, and he is now serving a 12-year prison sentence. If Naziba's relatives had been barred from testifying on her behalf, Naziba's father might still be raping her today.</p><p>The timing of this proposed change to the law is important: a recent report by UN Women found that reported cases of violence against women was up 28% in the past year. This finding is significant because it illustrates that Afghan women are beginning to understand their rights and demand access to them.</p><p>Since 2007, our organisation has worked hard to build coalitions with local police departments, government ministries and court officials. As a result of our advocacy, these agencies are referring more and more victims to our services, instead of sending them back home or imprisoning them for running away. In some provinces, such as Kabul, the police are our biggest ally – they refer more women than any other agency. This gives us hope, illustrating that there has been a shift in attitude and perception about violence against women, not only among Afghan women, but at an institutional level as well.</p><p>However, should Karzai ratify this law, I fear that women would stop coming forward because prosecutions would be nearly impossible to secure. As an organisation that has been working tirelessly to obtain justice for women and girls who have suffered so much and so needlessly, our hands would be tied. There would be little we could do.</p><p>We, along with other human rights activists, refuse to stand back and allow this to happen. The stakes are too high and the consequences too horrific to imagine.</p>","headline":"A law that would permit Afghan men to hurt and rape female relatives","trailText":"<strong>Manizha Naderi: </strong>President Karzai is about to ratify a law that would prevent relatives testifying against men accused of domestic violence","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3j","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679116027/Gulnaz-19-rape-victim-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679116027/Gulnaz-19-rape-victim-004.jpg","wordcount":"664","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429042200","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652100","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Manizha Naderi","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039113","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T10:11:51Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/law-afghan-men-hurt-rape-female-relatives-karzai","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/law-afghan-men-hurt-rape-female-relatives-karzai","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/afghanistan","webTitle":"Afghanistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/afghanistan","references":[]},{"id":"society/domestic-violence","webTitle":"Domestic violence","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/domestic-violence","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/domestic-violence","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/manizha-naderi","webTitle":"Manizha Naderi","r2ContributorId":"60853","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391677031449/Manizha-Naderi.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Manizha Naderi is the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.womenforafghanwomen.org/\">Women for Afghan Women</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/manizha-naderi","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/manizha-naderi","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/women","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429044846","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679108745/Gulnaz-19-rape-victim-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","photographer":"Lalage Snow, Lalage Snow","altText":"Gulnaz, 19, rape victim","height":"340","credit":"Lalage Snow, Lalage Snow/PR","caption":"Gulnaz, 19, was raped by a cousin but found guilty of adultery and jailed for 12 years.

But like Maria Callas or Winston Churchill he was an essential talent","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-06T09:53:13Z","body":"<p>How do you solve a problem like Kevin?&nbsp;Not this way, in my view. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/04/kevin-pietersen-england-ecb\" title=\"\">England cricket's announcement this week that&nbsp;it prefers to cut&nbsp;its best player adrift</a> rather than endure any more of the dressing-room divisions and on-field&nbsp;frustrations that appear to be&nbsp;part of the package deal that is Kevin&nbsp;Pietersen seems a clear sign of official weakness not strength. Problem solved? In my view it's a problem ducked and problem failed.</p><p>For those of you who neither know nor care about England cricket, rest assured that this column is only briefly and metaphorically about sport. Really it's about genius, or at least about special, sometimes awkward, brilliance. Its theme is that the problem posed to English cricket by Pietersen's reckless talent – and the safety-first way it has been bundled out of the room – has resonances that are much wider than sport.</p><p>It's pretty obvious from beyond the boundary that Pietersen has an Everest-size ego, is absurdly cavalier with his talent, and frequently puts himself first, rather than the team. Yet on his day Pietersen is still the most exciting English batsman of the last decade and one of the most talented of all time. He hasn't played well in Australia this winter – though he still got <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013-14/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=7899;type=series\" title=\"\">more runs than any other England player</a>. But the fact that he also appears to be a pain in the backside means he has been made the fall guy for failure. Now he's gone, and we are the poorer for it.</p><p>These dilemmas can occur in all walks of life, but cricket has handled its version in exactly the wrong way. Writing yesterday, for instance, under the headline \"Master of his art always worth the trouble\" the Times's Simon Barnes compared Pietersen with Deco in The Commitments. Everyone in the band disliked Deco because he was a pain, he wrote. But Deco had a great voice, and the band was nothing without him. As Barnes put it: \"He made&nbsp;the band and he destroyed the band. Or perhaps the band destroyed themselves because they couldn't face the fact that they needed him.\"</p><p>The performing arts, with their larger than life diva personalities, are full of such examples. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a> was simply the best of most eras. She&nbsp;set new standards of intensity. There has&nbsp;been no one to touch her since she&nbsp;gave&nbsp;up in&nbsp;the early 1960s. But Callas was a monster as well as a marvel. She threw&nbsp;tantrums. She put herself first.&nbsp;She walked away mid-performance. She&nbsp;cancelled. She drove colleagues mad. But I'll go to my grave regretting that I am just too young to have heard Callas sing.</p><p>There is, admittedly, a fine line between the indispensable and the dispensable, and it makes a lot of difference which side of it you are on. In&nbsp;1919 the incomparably revered Italian&nbsp;conductor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Toscanini\" title=\"\">Arturo Toscanini</a>, famous for <a href=\"http://fonderiausa.com/toscanini-in-a-rage\" title=\"\">his rages</a> with orchestras that failed to meet his standards, was so enraged by the sloppiness of a violin player in the Turin orchestra during a rehearsal that he jabbed at the man's bow with his conductor's baton. The bow went into the violinist's eye and the violinist sued. Toscanini won the case because the Italian courts accepted an expert witness's assertion that the Maestro was in a condition of \"sublime frenzy\" caused by his genius. Maybe Pietersen's lawyers should try that one on the England cricket board.</p><p>The American soprano <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Battle\" title=\"\">Kathleen Battle</a>, by contrast, was a top of the range star in the 1980s and early 1990s. Not a Toscanini or a Callas (who is?) but pretty good all the same. But Battle's ego and demands – she is said to have phoned her agent in New York from a limousine in California to get him to call the driver to turn down the air conditioning – seriously damaged her career. Managements <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/arts/the-met-drops-kathleen-battle-citing-unprofessional-actions.html\" title=\"\">sacked her</a>. Delighted stagehands at the New York Met sported T-shirts saying I Survived the Battle.</p><p>Politics has its equivalent of the Pietersen problem too – and it is sometimes even expressed in cricketing metaphors. Who can forget the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/1/newsid_2513000/2513953.stm\" title=\"\">resignation speech by Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1990</a>, in which he excoriated Margaret Thatcher as a captain who had deliberately broken her&nbsp;team's bats in the changing room? There is a lot in common between the way Thatcher behaved, especially in her later career – undermining colleagues, picking fights, ignoring others and generally doing her own thing – and the problems that Pietersen is said to have caused in the England dressing room.</p><p>Like cricket, politics is a team game played by individuals who are preoccupied with their own success, to the extent of actively trying to do down those on their own side. In modern politics, where the insistence on being on-message and sticking to the line is such a dominant part of the culture, there is even less opportunity for a Pietersen to prosper than there once was. And where someone breaks the on-message rules, the consequences can be catastrophic. Australian Labor's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd\" title=\"\">Kevin Rudd</a>, determined to destroy the band because it had fired him, is a classic example.</p><p>But in politics, as in cricket, there needs to be space for the person whose&nbsp;talents outweigh the difficulties they occasionally cause. Winning teams&nbsp;need their mavericks like Kenneth Clarke, David Davis, Tom Watson or Frank Field – people who approach the conventional political arena from an unusual angle.</p><p>In British politics, the ultimate Pietersen was Winston Churchill,&nbsp;manifestly the best political leader of his era when the chips were down, but often a loner, an exile, and a difficult person to rein&nbsp;in or follow. \"When&nbsp;Winston was born,\" Stanley Baldwin confided in 1936, \"lots&nbsp;of fairies&nbsp;swooped down on his cradle with&nbsp;gifts – imagination, <sup></sup>eloquence, industry, ability – and then&nbsp;came a fairy&nbsp;who said 'No one person has a right&nbsp;to so many gifts' and picked him up and gave him such a shake and twist that with all these gifts he was denied judgment and wisdom.\" That's pretty much what the cricket writers have been saying about Pietersen this week, in fact.</p><p>But it wasn't Baldwin's last word on Churchill. \"I had the great pleasure of spending nearly three hours with Churchill in London yesterday,\" Baldwin wrote in 1943. \"You can take it from me he is a really big man, the war has brought out the best that was in him. I pray he is spared to see us through.\" Pietersen is no Churchill, of&nbsp;course. But in sport, as in politics, if&nbsp;you have a really big man available, you surely need him in your team.</p>","headline":"Sport, music, politics: they all need mavericks like Kevin Pietersen","trailText":"<p><strong>Martin Kettle:</strong> The batsman's brilliance proved too much for England.

So we’re <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com.au/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/17/bob-katter/within-three-eight-years-australia-will-be-net-imp/\">not facing any imminent risk</a> of having to depend on other nations for food, even if some of the 300,000 farming jobs are lost. </p><p>We do however import more processed fruit and vegetables than we export, which is why food-processing companies like SPC Ardmona are under pressure from foreign competitors with cheaper input costs. As are the local car manufacturing industry, and the textiles, clothing and footwear sector, just to name two other examples.</p><p>The real reason farm jobs are treated as a special case is because they have a parliamentary cheer squad: a casual trawl through the register of pecuniary interests shows the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Members/Register\">members</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Senators_Interests/Register\">senators</a> who also run family farms and earn additional income from their businesses, however modest that income might be. </p><p>Owning and operating a farm doesn’t appear to preclude these parliamentarians from agricultural committees or inquiries that might pose a conflict of interest – indeed a commercial interest could be said to be an apparent prequalification. It’s extraordinary that no other part of the Australian economy is similarly represented in parliament with such potential vested interests – other than the dinosaur and Titanic-restoration industries of course.</p><p>The simple fact is that farm businesses made unviable by weather, interest rates, the dollar, tariffs, or labor costs should no more be propped up by government than any other unsustainable business. Even the government’s own rural <a href=\"http://www.daff.gov.au/agriculture-food/drought/assistance\">assistance measures</a> seem to recognise this by focusing on preparedness and risk-management for farms under stress. </p><p>While Stone’s crash through or crash performance was certainly diverting, her neighbour in the adjoining electorate of Indi also made an interesting contribution to the SPCA debate yesterday. Drawing on her expertise as an agricultural consultant, whose role is to advise farmers on the best ways to run their operations, independent MP Cathy McGowan refrained from condemning the SPCA decision and opted instead to call for a \"<a href=\"http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/politics/indi-mp-cathy-mcgowan-supports-mining-magnate-mp-clive-palmer/story-fnkerdda-1226817548860\" style=\"font-size: 15px;\">national debate about what's the future for manufacturing for rural and regional Australia</a>.”</p><p>Stone is rallying for hearts, while McGowan is appealing to minds. It will be interesting to see which of the two parliamentarians’ remonstrations ultimately prevail.</p>","headline":"Australian farmers should not be treated like protected species","trailText":"<b>Paula Matthewson: </b><i></i>The fact that Australian farms are almost entirely family owned and operated should not make them a special case more worthy of government assistance than other professions","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgv2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391646119491/c5d80740-7703-49f8-8954-de5cdc48ad4a-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391646119491/c5d80740-7703-49f8-8954-de5cdc48ad4a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"675","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429020394","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2c6efe4b0ab978b0f9720","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paula Matthewson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039015","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T11:30:32+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/australian-farmers-should-not-be-treated-like-protected-species","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/australian-farmers-should-not-be-treated-like-protected-species","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"environment/farming","webTitle":"Farming","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/farming","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"business/spc-ardmona","webTitle":"SPC Ardmona","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/spc-ardmona","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/spc-ardmona","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/liberal-party","webTitle":"Liberal party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberal-party","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/liberal-party","references":[]},{"id":"world/national-party","webTitle":"National party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/national-party","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/national-party","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paula-matthewson","webTitle":"Paula Matthewson","r2ContributorId":"56624","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/24/1369356496226/paula_matthewson.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paula Matthewson was media adviser to John Howard in the early 1990s and then had a long career as an industry lobbyist.

The exertion of brisk movement, the need to monitor direction and the requirements of observation and safety, seem exactly calibrated to free up the brain so that it is sharper and clearer, better able to focus. But walking is more than that. In a world lived so extensively through the dislocating media of the web, where there is no reality, walking reconnects with real space and time. It is a way of rebuilding a relationship with the concrete, and it can also be a way of being free of it. Woolf called it street rambling. Dickens, more obsessive, houselessness.

It would be done without warning or discussion, without anaesthetic or normal standards of hygiene. Now picture the horror and the outrage. No one would doubt that it was wrong, that it should be condemned and that every effort should be made to stop it. It would be recognised as child abuse.</p><p>Female genital mutilation is like that, except that its victims and their injuries are unseen. FGM, or cutting, is a violation that is inflicted only on girls, usually as very young children. It is not a religious ritual. It predates Christianity and Islam, although in some places both religions have incorporated it as a rite of passage. What it is, universally, is a weapon of control by men over women's sexuality in which older women collude in order to observe social norms of marriageability and honour.</p><p>The procedure is an assault. Its victims describe agonising pain and tell terrible tales of long-running infection and even the deaths of sisters or friends. It often brings with it a lifetime of psychological and physical damage. It can leave its victims unable to have children. Nearly 30 years ago in the UK, campaigners thought a corner had been turned when parliament outlawed FGM. Yet in all the years since, there has been not a single prosecution, let alone a conviction, and – in a field dominated by guesswork and extrapolation – there is no evidence that criminalisation has made an impact at all. Yet more than 60,000 women and girls have been mutilated, some as children taken abroad for the brutally named cutting season, others almost certainly in private homes in British towns and cities.</p><p>The law cannot help victims who are barely out of kindergarten, suffering in families living apparently exemplary lives. Even when they are older, the plunge into social ostracism that giving evidence against their own parents would entail is too daunting a prospect. Even to speak about it at all takes a great deal of courage. Then there are authorities with the power to intervene who are reluctant to confront what has in the past been seen as a cultural issue, too sensitive to address. Campaigners often point to France, where there have been 30 successful prosecutions resulting in a hundred convictions. There is no law specifically outlawing FGM, but there is less anxiety about challenging FGM as an abuse. Any successful prosecutions are better than none, but at the rate of about one a year, it does not amount to a triumphant vindication of the power of the statute book. There is no better record of success in other European courts. It seems only realistic to accept that the law is not the most effective way of stopping FGM.</p><p>And that is why today, on the UN's first day of Zero Tolerance on FGM, the Guardian is launching a national and international campaign <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/05/british-girl-guardian-campaign-end-female-genital-mutilation-fgm\" title=\"\">to end FGM</a>. We are not the first to try. There are ministers in government – Jane Ellison at the Department of Health and Lynne Featherstone at International Development – who have prioritised action. The efforts of others – <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/nhs-to-create-new-codes-to-help-doctors-and-nurses-report-cases-of-fgm-and-estimate-scale-of-problem-in-britain-9106419.html\" title=\"\">in London, </a> Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff and Birmingham – are slowly bringing greater recognition of the problem. But too many young girls – perhaps 20,000, the daughters of mothers who have themselves been cut – remain at risk. After discussions with campaigners and among communities where it is practised, it became clear that an education programme delivered through every school in the country could provide the breakthrough in cultural attitudes that could make a real difference. We want everyone to be aware that FGM is illegal. We want potential victims – and parents who are perhaps under pressure from family elders – to know there are people and organisations ready to offer support. The only person who can make it happen is the education secretary, Michael Gove. This week, he wrote to every school about discipline. It will cost almost nothing. It could transform thousands of lives. Just pick up your pen, Mr Gove.</p>","headline":"Female genital mutilation: end it","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> There are authorities with the power to intervene who are reluctant to confront what has in the past been seen as a cultural issue","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgv4","wordcount":"694","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429020598","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8647932","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039017","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T23:41:10Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/female-genital-mutilation-editorial","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/female-genital-mutilation-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"society/female-genital-mutilation","webTitle":"Female genital mutilation (FGM)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/female-genital-mutilation","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","references":[]},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/health","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/women","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

The footage showed the interior of the Yandina pub; we were looking through an eye in the sky at a group of men having a beer at the bar. It got slightly more interesting when the footage switched outside and someone delivered a pizza.</p><p>I had to repress a desire to laugh or whoop loudly, an urge that always arises in funereal atmospheres that involve something absurd. Sitting quietly beside me were the wives, friends and family of the men: a fairly ordinary-looking group of Sunshine Coast residents, with nothing that screamed, \"Vicious Lawless Associate\". The man in the brown shirt sitting in the dock didn’t look to be the frothing-at-the-mouth type the title of the legislation (the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.legislation.qld.gov.au%2FBills%2F54PDF%2F2013%2FVicLawAssDisB13.pdf&amp;ei=V77yUsmfBsiykgWAjIG4Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwFKZ4IsvqprZSC0vT7qa52k0jUw&amp;sig2=n2ieqXhh3K4mVnkeF0QD-A&amp;bvm=bv.60799247,d.dGI\">Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act</a>) suggested. He told his lawyer he was dying for a smoke.</p><p>I was at the bail application for the five Yandina men who were caught fraternising at the local pub, an activity that is now outlawed for certain groups of people. The men are allegedly part of the Rebels motorcycle club, one of the 26 newly-designated criminal organisations. Under the laws, if three or more so-called gang members gather, they face imprisonment in solitary confinement for six months. If being locked in a prison cell for 22­–23 hours each day isn’t enough, <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/metal-walls-erected-outside-prison-cells-of-bikies-at-arthur-gorrie-correctional-centre/story-fnihsrf2-1226786181867\">metal walls</a> have been erected outside some prison windows at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional centre to block out signs of life.</p><p>Chief magistrate Tim Carmody, after watching the video for a few minutes, commented that there wasn’t much of a plot. Nonetheless, within a few minutes, it was obvious that some of these guys wouldn’t be granted bail.</p><p>Carmody, a former policeman, had initially put himself in charge of all disputed bail applications by accused bikies. In a recent <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/queensland-chief-magistrate-tim-carmody-warns-judiciary-against-using-position-to-criticise-new-laws/story-fnihsrf2-1226812904278\">Courier Mail</a> article, he admonished the judiciary for criticising the new laws.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The courts will be vulnerable to criticism, for example, if their members use the weight of their office to engage in the public debate or make comments about the comparative morality or fairness of regular laws regardless of which political party sponsored them, or routinely adopted approaches to bail or sentencing practices clearly at odds with legislative or administrative policy intents or legitimate criminal justice objects such as deterrence or community protection via hard line incapacitation strategies.</p></blockquote><p>What happens when the laws are patently unjust? Are judges expected to stay silent simply because parliament is \"supreme\"? Silence doesn’t seem the best option when the Liberal national party has a majority in parliament, there is no upper house, and bills are rushed through without much consultation with legal or community groups.</p><p>Judges in the US have <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/111813-lwop-complete-report.pdf\">criticised mandatory sentences</a> for people who are given life without parole (LWOP) for non-violent crimes for the simple reason that the sentences – and the laws that give them teeth – are unconscionable and hideously unjust. In the US, a tough-on-crime policy that started in the 1960s, and has continued unabated ever since, has led to a mania for mandatory sentencing.</p><p>A federal district court judge recently made his opinions clear when he handed down the sentence of LWOP to a man who sold crack cocaine to support his drug habit:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think a life sentence for what you have done in this case is ridiculous. It is a travesty. I don’t have any discretion about it. I don’t agree with it, either. And I want the world and the record to be clear on that. This is just silly. But as I say, I don’t have any choice.</p></blockquote><p>A thought kept circling in my mind that day in court – exactly what crime had these men committed? Some of the men had previous encounters with the law, mainly involving drugs. The man that delivered the pizza, Joshua Carew, had a 2012 suspended jail sentence for possession of cocaine and was recently fined over possession of speed and firearms. But this time he wasn’t in court over crimes like trafficking or possession, that require solid evidence. This was six months solitary for association.</p><p>Simply by virtue of their alleged membership, the supposed gang members are deemed an \"unacceptable risk to society\". Carmody used an analogy where he suggested that if a person were a member of a rugby or cricket team, the chances were that he or she was going to run on the field with the other members. The person needed to prove that he or she was not going to run on the field.</p><p>The presumption against bail means that the lawyers need to show cause as to why the men should be released.</p><p>I’m troubled by the idea that a person’s membership of a club and their criminal history can be used as predictive of future conduct – effectively imprisoning a person because they may commit a crime in the future. Ultimately it means a presumption of guilt rather than innocence, a reversal of the usual legal principle. It is saying that these people aren’t simply enjoying a beer but are, more likely than not, planning future crimes.</p><p>Of the five men who came before the judge, three were denied bail. Two men, Paul Landsdowne and Joshua Carew, spent time in solitary over Christmas but were later released by supreme court judges. One of the five men, Steven Smith, remains in solitary.</p><p>Speaking of his <a href=\"http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/dads-beeline-for-kids/2141108/\">six weeks locked up in a cell for 23 hours</a> for all but four days, Carew said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>You start hearing voices and you are talking to yourself. Some have been in there for four months.</p></blockquote><p>It is well documented that solitary confinement has the <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/australia/australian-notes/9128282/australian-notes-200/\">propensity to send relatively sane people completely mad</a>.</p><p>The aim of all this – criminalising an organisation, restricting associations with members, the presumption against bail, solitary confinement, six months mandatory – is to dismantle bikie clubs. Being a member of a blacklisted organisation means, in the words of Carmody, that \"every time you pop your head up you’re going to attract the risk of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment … eventually if that happens to you often enough you’ll change your friendship group.\"</p><p>Obvious questions remain: if people have indeed been involved in criminal activities, why can’t the police use standard methods of investigation, following the money trail, say, or using other traditional means of gathering evidence? Isn’t criminalising association just relieving the burden of producing evidence for actual crimes committed?</p><p>The reasons why a group is designated a \"criminal organisation\" <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/bikie-evidence-to-be-secret-forever-20140115-30vg3.html\">remain secret</a>. In the past police provided evidence to a supreme court judge to have a particular group declared a criminal organisation by a court. Now the details are kept secret and the evidence can’t be heard by a judge because \"making [it] public could jeopardise police operations or public safety\".</p><p>Attorney-general Jarrod Bleijie has explained that the designations are based on police evidence and criminal histories. And that is it: the declarations of the executive are conceived as so inherently right and benign that there is no need for transparency or opportunities for challenge.</p><p>It doesn’t stretch the imagination too much to consider that such declarations could, sometime in the future, be used to declare a politically inconvenient and bothersome organisation criminal.</p><p>Recently, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/06/victorian-bikie-gang-suspects-charged-under-queensland-anti-association-laws\">five alleged Victorian bikies</a> were arrested under the new laws on the Gold Coast. They were stopped by police on their way to buy ice cream after having Chinese food for dinner and were arrested days later. The first woman, Sally Kuether, faced court under the new laws after <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/how-council-librarian-mum-sally-louise-keuther-became-an-accused-outlaw-bikie-after-meeting-phillip-crow-frederick-palmer/story-fnihsrf2-1226810926202\">CCTV footage</a> showed her with two alleged bikies inside a Dayboro hotel. She was apparently wearing colours: a \"Life and Death\" vest with the words \"Property of the Crow\" on it. Her bail application went before Brisbane magistrate Noel Nunan and was successful. She had spent more than a week in the watch house prior to appearing in court.</p><p>Premier Newman said that he doesn’t <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/newman-says-he-doesnt-like-his-governments-bikie-laws-20140113-30qsc.html\">\"particularly like\"</a> the laws and plans to repeal them after a three year review. A review of the legislation in 2016 is cold comfort for those currently before the courts potentially facing mandatory sentences in solitary. Newman has accused the \"other side\" of launching a \"sophisticated PR campaign\"; the \"branding\" of the Yandina 5 as \"human rights victims\". I’m not sure a Facebook page and the sale of T-shirts is what you would call a sophisticated PR campaign. In response, the Liberal national party has been looking to appoint <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-24/librarian-is-first-woman-charged-under-anti-bikie-laws/5218212\">PR consultants</a> to promote the new laws, the cost of which is estimated to be around $500,000.</p><p>An essential, critical point has been entirely lost on Newman – a point that is easily lost on someone who is trying to establish power through a hard line law and order policy. Freedom of association is considered a fundamental human right, set down in Article 20 of the UDHR: \"everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association\". We seem to accept state imposed limitations on our individual freedom for the purposes of security, to protect us from the harm another may inflict on us. The social \"evil\" that the government is trying to protect us from in this case is \"criminal bikie gangs\" – and we have to ask whether the forms of social control that the government has imposed is warranted. I’m convinced that they aren’t.</p><p>Isaiah Berlin says in his essay <a href=\"http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/wiso_vwl/johannes/Ankuendigungen/Berlin_twoconceptsofliberty.pdf\">Two Concepts of Liberty</a> that the limits of our freedom will always be a source of infinite debate. He writes that Jefferson, Burke, Paine and Mill developed similar arguments as to why authority should be kept at bay: \"we must preserve a minimum area of personal freedom if we are not to degrade or deny our nature\". </p><p>To associate freely, to speak freely, to protest against injustice and to wear what we wish surely relates to that. Restrictions on association, no matter how well intended, potentially lead to two outcomes: a lurch toward despotism, or a crushing imposition of social conformity.</p><p>Let’s hope no other state or territory follows the lunacy currently playing out in Queensland.</p><p>• This piece originally appeared on <a href=\"http://overland.org.au/2014/02/six-months-solitary-for-association/\">Overland</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/guardian-comment-network\">Guardian Comment Network</a></p>","headline":"In Queensland, drinking with the wrong crowd can get you six months in solitary","trailText":"<b>Ella Humphreys for Overland: </b><i></i>In the context of a brutal crackdown on bike gang members, new authoritarian laws can essentially lead to someone's imprisonment because they may commit a crime in the future","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfqf","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391640007664/71af6981-13b5-4e4c-abe2-8eda5c118c51-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391640007664/71af6981-13b5-4e4c-abe2-8eda5c118c51-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1673","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429018280","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2bcd0e4b0ab978b0f9715","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ella Humphreys for Overland","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039001","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T10:00:52+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/in-queensland-drinking-with-the-wrong-crowd-can-get-you-six-months-in-solitary","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/in-queensland-drinking-with-the-wrong-crowd-can-get-you-six-months-in-solitary","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/queensland","webTitle":"Queensland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/queensland","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/queensland","references":[]},{"id":"world/queensland-politics","webTitle":"Queensland politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/queensland-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/queensland-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"law/civil-liberties-international","webTitle":"Civil liberties -

Religious minorities should be better protected</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-05T22:22:02.474Z","body":"<p>Exactly three years ago, on 6 February 2011, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/06/16/indonesia-monitor-trials-deadly-attack-religious-minority\">some 1,500 Islamist militants stormed the Ahmadiyah community in Cikeusik village</a> in western Java.  In this exceptionally brutal assault, which was captured on video,  the attackers  beat three Ahmadiyah men to death and seriously injured five others. Gruesome  footage of the violence circulated widely on the internet, shocking Indonesians and the world. Police ultimately used the video evidence to identify several perpetrators, 12 of whom were convicted but <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/07/28/indonesia-verdicts-setback-religious-freedom\" style=\"font-size: 15px;\">given lenient sentences from three to six months’ imprisonment</a>. </p><p>Neighbouring governments like Australia have good reason for concern about the Indonesian government’s apparently inability or unwillingness to protect the Ahmadiyah, a Muslim sect, and other religious minorities from bigoted thugs who act with apparent impunity. </p><p>Two weeks ago, a survivor of that horrific attack, Acmad Masihuddin, accompanied me to visit several Ahmadiyah communities in the hills outside Jakarta. Masihuddin told me how that fateful day he tried to run away.  Members of the mob caught him and dragged him back, stripping him to his underwear, and beat him with a hoe and machete, until a police officer pronounced him dead and put him in the back of a police van – saving his life.</p><p>Masihuddin, whose injuries required two years of treatment, still suffers from headaches and lost partial sight in one of his eyes. Now he works for one of Indonesia’s leading human rights groups, Kontras, to support victims of religious violence. Masihuddin told me, “I am working for Kontras, because I want to stop this from happening again.”</p><p>Three years after what should have been Indonesia’s wake up call to address religious violence, the  Ahmadiyah and  the country’s other religious minorities are under threat.  Across Indonesia, there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/human-rights-are-under-attack-in-post-tsunami-indonesia\">multiplying incidents of harassment, threats and violence</a> against religious minorities including several Christian groups, Shia and the Ahmadiyah. These groups have become targets of Islamist militant groups who label most non-Muslims as “infidels,” and Muslims who do not adhere to Sunni orthodoxy as “blasphemers.” Even Indonesia’s atheists live in fear of such groups.</p><p>Islamist militants have increasingly and often violently attacked Ahmadiyah since 2005 when Indonesia’s Ulama council, the MUI (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), declared a fatwa, or religious edict, ruling that the Ahmadiyah community deviated from Qur'anic teachings. In 2008, the government passed <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/09/indonesia-reverse-ban-ahmadiyah-sect\">a nationwide anti-Ahmadiyah decree</a> than bans the Ahmadiyah from proselytising their faith. The government justified this decree on the basis of reducing violence and promoting religious harmony. Instead, the number of attacks has steadily risen and more than 30 towns, regencies and provinces across Indonesia have followed suit, with some outright banning the Ahmadiyah as West Java province has.</p><p>I met with representatives of five Ahmadiyah communities in Sukadana, West Java, who described almost daily intimidation, harassment and discrimination, resulting in the closure of three Ahmadiyah mosques by local officials. Ulamas have preached sermons of hate and intolerance over loudspeakers and in some cases, started campaigns to avoid Ahmadiyah-owned businesses. “I get jittery every time I hear the ulamas speaking over the loudspeaker,” an Ahmadiyah woman told me.</p><p>Some Ahmadiyah have found it difficult to find jobs. Several men described bureaucratic hurdles when dealing with local officials or requesting new identification documents or building permits. Some Ahmadiyah teachers have been pressured to convert to Sunni Islam or transferred to remote schools when they resisted. Ahmadiyah children have also been bullied by classmates and teachers have pressured them to denounce their “heretical” religious views. Even hospitals are unwilling to accept Ahmadiyah blood, with one woman telling me, “We try to donate blood and we are refused, they say we don’t want Ahmadiyah blood. Only if it’s an emergency, then they come here and ask us.”</p><p>This sweeping ostracization of the Ahmadiyah is more insidious than the brutal violence of the Cikeusik attack, and just as dangerous.</p><p>Islamists have been emboldened by the success in repressing the Ahmadiyah and are also turning their attention to other minority groups, like the Shia, Bahai and Christians. A 2006 decree that requires religious groups to get permission from a significant number of community members before building a house of worship has been used to shut down not only around 30 Ahmadiyah mosques, but more than 500 Christian churches and several Buddhist temples as well.</p><p>Why should Australians care?</p><p>A neighbouring country that fails to act decisively in the face of religious violence and facilitates intolerance of other faiths in violation of Indonesia’s own Constitution risks destabilising the region. While Indonesia has done reasonably well in curbing terrorism, its enabling attitude towards intolerant Islamists may create threats which might spill over Indonesia’s borders.  Australia does not want to see <a href=\"http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/indonesia-risks-taking-pakistans-path-to-intolerance/\">Indonesia follow the path of Pakistan</a>, where a failure of accountability for violence against religious minorities has led to steady increases in violence against Ahmadiyah, Shia, and Christians.\"</p><p>To curb this trend of intolerance, the Indonesian government needs to act decisively. It can start by revoking discriminatory decrees as well as thoroughly investigating and punishing acts of religious violence. So far, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has claimed he has <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/01/sby-vows-address-religious-intolerance-upon-receiving-international-award.html\">“no tolerance” for religious violence</a> , yet has he repeatedly failed to back up that promise with action.  Australia and other key governments have leverage and should keep the pressure on Yudhoyono to address religious violence. </p>","headline":"Indonesia’s growing religious intolerance has to be addressed","trailText":"<b>Elaine Pearson: </b>On the third anniversary of a brutal attack by extremists Islamist which killed three Ahmadiyah men, religious intolerance remains.

Whether it's the food industry dictating <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2550655/How-food-giants-woo-ministers-Sugar-campaigners-fears-secret-stitch-meetings.html\" title=\"\">public health policy</a>, school academy chains stuffing the pockets of directors' relatives, or the revolving-door appointments of politicians and civil servants to companies they previously favoured with contracts, it's the banks and corporations that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/04/corporate-britain-corrupt-lobbying-revolving-door\" title=\"\">call the shots</a> in Whitehall and Westminster.</p><p>Most of David Cameron's Conservative party funding comes from the City. Former New Labour ministers, such as Alan Milburn – the ex-health secretary advising a venture capital firm <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10593106/Poverty-tsar-Alan-Milburn-makes-a-million.html\" title=\"\">involved in NHS privatisation</a>, as well as both government and opposition – have won lucrative private sector contracts on the back of their years in office.</p><p>Meanwhile, the political parties outside parliament have drastically shrunk and are largely treated as a distraction from the serious business of power-broking and electoral marketing by the political elite. It's scarcely surprising that the public regard the whole carry-on as very little to do with them, or that there was such a strong reaction to the comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-democratic-system-newsnight\" title=\"\">Russell Brand's rejection of voting</a> for parties whose differences were so \"insignificant\".</p><p>Since his election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/ed-miliband-labour-leader\" title=\"\">as Labour leader in 2010</a>, Ed Miliband has gingerly tried to shift the terms of political trade and caused establishment apoplexy with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/24/miliband-critics-fears-he-will-win-election\" title=\"\">attacks on predatory capitalism</a> and his plan to freeze energy prices. The Times reports corporate executives complaining that while Labour's Ed Balls and Chuka Umunna are \"well regarded in corporate circles\" and have been \"heavily courted\", they do not have \"sufficient clout\" to rein in Miliband.</p><p>That is the context of the permanent onslaught on Labour's links with the trade unions, the only force still connected to mainstream politics which sits outside the corporate merry-go-round and gives political access to working class people. That's why the media keeps up its Orwellian denunciation of elected union leaders as \"bosses\" and \"barons\", while company bosses are described as \"business leaders\" – and why every strike is treated as tantamount to high treason.</p><p>It's also why the only media and Westminster test of Miliband's Labour reforms is whether they cut union influence enough. At the moment they're not entirely sure, perhaps partly because most reporting of the issue is so wildly inaccurate. In any case, nothing short of the exemplary arrest of a few union leaders would satisfy some of Miliband's tormentors.</p><p>The reality is that the Labour leader was panicked into demanding sweeping changes to the union link by false allegations of rigging by the Unite union at the Falkirk parliamentary selection last summer. As the party's leaked internal report demonstrates, even the flaky evidence it provided did not back up those claims. What had in fact happened was that Unite had recruited several dozen industrial workers to the local party to help select a candidate who would break the monopoly of the existing parliamentary elite.</p><p>Miliband's reforms have avoided the more extreme options championed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/27/alan-johnson-reform-labour-union-link\" title=\"\">Blairite diehards</a>. But they risk failing in the Labour leader's aim of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/31/ed-miliband-labour-union-funding-shakeup\" title=\"\">\"letting people back into politics\"</a>, quite apart from the threat to the party's income. True, the collective union link is maintained and MPs will lose their disproportionate voice in leadership elections.</p><p>But by setting up a new double hurdle for union political levy payers to keep the voting rights they already have, the danger is that fewer people will end up having a say than before. Just under <a href=\"http://www2.labour.org.uk/votes-by-round\" title=\"\">200,000 union levy-payers </a>voted in Labour's 2010 leadership election, out of a total of around 323,000, many of them the shopworkers, bus drivers, nurses and building workers Miliband says he wants to get involved in politics.</p><p>Labour will now be lucky to get that number next time, which will probably be fewer than 10% of the 2.7 million currently eligible to vote. There will certainly be many fewer taking part in the London mayoral selection contest. Add to that the fact that the Labour leadership resisted giving the new \"affiliated supporters\" a say in parliamentary selections – where the future shape of the Commons is decided – and the conservatism of the reforms is clear.</p><p>They could be improved over the next five years, or instead lay the ground for the disintegration of the link if Labour were to lose the general election. Miliband has set himself the goal of increasing participation. But people will only take part if they see it makes a difference, and years of erosion of party democracy and New Labour neoliberalism have left many trade unionists ready to break the link themselves.</p><p>The paradox is that the more people walk away from the political parties, the more they are dominated by professional politicians, corporate interests and political insider dealing. What happens in the mainstream parties matters because they are the ones running the political system.</p><p>That point has even penetrated the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10614852/Tim-Yeos-deselection-Is-this-the-start-of-a-Tory-Spring.html\" title=\"\">moribund Tory grassroots</a>, which have started to kick back against the Westminster elite by deselecting two MPs in a week. The real test for a Labour party revival will be whether Miliband is bold enough to throw his weight behind the kind of policies that would attract alienated voters, from a mass council housebuilding programme to universal childcare and 21st century rights at work.</p><p>That needs a stronger union voice and working class voice in politics, not a further hollowing out of Labour's organisation. The more the political elite is sealed off from any kind of political and social counterweight, the more control will be exercised by a City and corporate oligarchy.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a><em> </em></p>","headline":"We need a counterweight to City and corporate power","trailText":"<strong>Seumas Milne:</strong> Any further weakening of Labour's links with the unions will only deepen the crisis of representation in the political system","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfz9","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391631232572/Illustration-by-Matt-Keny-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391631232572/Illustration-by-Matt-Keny-006.jpg","wordcount":"898","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429005234","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8649584","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Seumas Milne","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038941","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T20:36:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/counterweight-city-corporate-power-labour-unions","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/counterweight-city-corporate-power-labour-unions","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"politics/tradeunions","webTitle":"Trade unions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/tradeunions","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/edmiliband","webTitle":"Ed Miliband","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/edmiliband","references":[]},{"id":"politics/tuc","webTitle":"TUC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/tuc","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labourleadership","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/seumasmilne","webTitle":"Seumas Milne","r2ContributorId":"21077","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/seamus_milne_140x140.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/20/1390230835398/SeumasMilne.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Seumas Milne is a Guardian columnist and associate editor.

But there are still a couple of women who are out to help fragrant Dave. That failed business woman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/30/worst-troll-2013\" title=\"\">Katie Hopkins</a>, for one, who lives hand-to-mouth by inciting hatred on downmarket TV shows. She makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith</a> look like Tony Benn. She really, really hates poor people. Can she be parachuted into a safe seat somewhere? And then there's Edwina Currie who, when she's not oversharing about her sexual prowess, is telling us that food banks encourage laziness. Earlier this week both these specimens appeared on a show called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/04/channel-5-benefits-street-white-dee-katie-hopkins\" title=\"\">The Big Benefits Row: Live</a> on Channel 5. Amazingly, for a show with \"row\" in the title, there was lots of shouting. There were good people on it who now seem mortified: White Dee from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/12/benefits-street-poverty-porn-british-fury\" title=\"\">Benefits Street</a> stayed calm and affable; writer and activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/15/transgender-coming-of-age-paris-lees\" title=\"\">Paris Lees</a> made a key point about low wages.</p><p>But as a discussion it failed because everything now starts from the prevailing Tory narrative that \"welfare\" is a luxury we can no longer afford.</p><p>The counter–narrative has been patchy and dispersed. There have been brilliant accounts of what it is like to live on benefits, impoverished and stigmatised, but not enough emphasis on the fact that most of the budget goes to pensioners and those in work. The working poor don't get their own reality shows. The worry about households where there have been generations of worklessness is a favourite, though it only applies to just 1% of claimants. Unsurprisingly the benefits \"row\" fiasco soon veered off into immigration, the clear subtext being that people are getting what they shouldn't.</p><p>But the bigger point to all this, and one that has to be met head on, is whether the actual end goal of such discourse is getting rid of the welfare state entirely. If you have been any place where there is no safety net, you will have seen people who appear prematurely aged, or severely obese with no teeth, or those with disabilities out begging on the streets. Some of these people will be vacantly staring into space or scavenging on rubbish heaps. Not everyone who is now unemployed can work. It's that simple.</p><p>But Labour goes along with the idea that welfare needs trimming, as the majority think it needs <sup></sup>reform. On the Big Benefits Row: Live, the politicians were abysmal, with the usual in-fighting. I waited in vain for one to make a coherent case for our moral obligation to each other.</p><p>That case has to be re-made because Charles Murray, the rightwing theorist who <a href=\"http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/3254.html\" title=\"\">first used the term underclass</a>, explained clearly how to get rid of a welfare state. You remove the moral obligation by arguing the other way round: it is welfare that creates moral disaster. You root that in individual weakness. What better describes Iain Duncan Smith's \"mission\"? The man who exaggerated on his CV and has presided over the closure of jobcentres pushes ever more punitive measures. He insists, as do Labour, that work is the route out of poverty, though we know that it can't be for everyone.</p><p>The coalition's sleight of hand means an increasing distancing from the world of benefits by those who see themselves as middle class. The removal of child benefit – a universal benefit – allows more people to feel they are getting nothing from the current system. They may use the NHS but they are not anchored to the state. A&nbsp;certain sympathy is eroded.</p><p>Benefits, then, become not something that we all contribute to and many rely on, but the province of a subspecies who should be means-tested, DNA-tested and gawped at. They are not \"us\" – and if they don't share our values, why should we share with them?</p><p>Osborne can then say welfare has to be capped, and Labour will agree to this. Abuse of the benefits system looks to the casual observer like a bigger problem than tax avoidance, though in terms of actual finance it is the other way round. The recession has enabled this ideological coup to take place, for even Thatcher did not start thinking about dismantling welfare until her third term. Her priority was always to take down the unions and she knew support for the NHS was high. By her third term though, the idea of outsourcing was created, thus the state is no longer a provider but a purchaser of services. This of course was totally endorsed by New Labour. So often Labour appear to have no purchase in many of these arguments.</p><p>None of the main parties represent a significant challenge to the idea that at the bottom of society a \"culture of entitlement\" exists. The culture of entitlement in reality exists at the top, in the form of sanctioned tax avoidance. But the supposed trickle down of wealth does not happen. Instead, there has been a trickle down of the attitudes of the wealthy: a disconnection from the state, mutual obligation and shared humanity.</p><p>Maybe there are no votes in representing the poorest, but what about reminding us that most of us do and will get benefits? Or that of the five evils that William Beveridge set out to end – want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness – at least four are still going strong.</p>","headline":"In the tawdry benefits debate, no politician speaks of moral obligations – so I will","trailText":"<strong>Suzanne Moore</strong>: Take away our obligations to each other as a society, and the welfare state becomes expendable.

CVS predicts it will lose $2bn of $125bn in annual revenues. </p><p>Perhaps ironically, a big chunk of CVS sales come from medications and supplies needed to treat chronic conditions caused by tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food consumption. The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nmh/events/ncd_action_plan/en/\">has identified </a>these three products as primary causes of the growing epidemics of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. By 2030, <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-economic-burden-non-communicable-diseases\">experts predict</a>, these diseases, which already cause more than 60% of all deaths worldwide, will cost the global economy an estimated $47tn.</p><p>From a public health perspective, the CVS decision is good news because <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2012/11_0274.htm\">research shows </a>that the ubiquity of unhealthy products contributes to their overuse. The more places people can purchase and consume alcohol, tobacco, sugary beverages, salty snacks and fast food, the more they ingest. Alcohol, tobacco and processed food corporations know that easy access triggers the cravings or addictions their products are designed to elicit. Normally, they vociferously oppose any limits on their right to put their wares within arm's reach. The decision by the nation's second largest pharmacy chain to choose a different path shows that public mobilization, changing social norms and regulation can combine to persuade at least some companies to choose the high road.</p><p>So maybe the next step for CVS and similar chains is to get rid of the candy, soda and snacks that contribute so significantly to diabetes. Maybe cities and states that want to protect young people from painful illnesses and premature death can use their zoning laws to limit the number of outlets selling unhealthy products. Alcohol, food and tobacco corporations will, of course, raise the bogeyman of the nanny state, suggesting that any effort to limit access to sickening products interferes with our freedom and absolves individuals of their responsibility to protect their health. </p><p>But that argument is silly; no one is suggesting prohibition. Isn't enticing children and young people to consume products that put them at risk of premature death and preventable illness the height of irresponsibility? Wouldn't most societies charge a nanny with child abuse if he or she tried to bypass parents to encourage children to begin risky habits? By looking for additional ways to persuade companies that the public will not tolerate profiting from selling disease, we encourage more corporate leaders to do the right thing.</p>","headline":"CVS stores will no longer sell cigarettes.

The milestone trial signals the end of France as a safe haven for <em>génocidaries</em>. But more than this, the trial is likely to see intense public scrutiny of one of the great scandals of the past century – <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13431486\" title=\"\">the role of France in the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi of Rwanda</a>, which for 20 years journalists and activists have tried so hard to expose.</p><p>Pascal Simbikangwa, the defendant in Paris, is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26030493\" title=\"\">said to have been a member of an inner circle of power in Rwanda </a>that devised genocide as a planned political campaign. Developed by Hutu&nbsp;ideologues, it was intended to prevent a&nbsp;power-sharing system of government that was to include the&nbsp;minority Tutsi. The genocide claimed up&nbsp;to a million lives.</p><p>A captain in the Rwandan gendarmerie until 1986, when he was paralysed in a car accident, Simbikangwa – a fanatic who hoped to create what was known as \"a pure Hutu state\" – worked for the security services in the capital Kigali. He&nbsp;was eventually found hiding out in the French department of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte\" title=\"\">Mayotte</a>, an island group in the Indian Ocean, with 3,000 forged identity papers – more than&nbsp;enough for the hundreds of Rwandan fugitives still at large. He&nbsp;denies all the charges, and his lawyer&nbsp;says he is a scapegoat.</p><p>Until now there has been a complete absence of will in Paris to bring to justice any of the estimated 27 Rwandan&nbsp;genocide fugitives who live on&nbsp;French soil. The country was a&nbsp;staunch ally of the Rwandan government which planned and perpetrated the genocide. The trial may well show the French electorate just how appalling its secret policy towards the central African state&nbsp;really was.</p><p>The policy was devised in secret, with&nbsp;no accountability from press or parliament and largely determined within the confines of a special office in&nbsp;the president's Elysée Palace known as the Africa Unit. It operated through a&nbsp;network of military officers, politicians, diplomats, businessmen and senior intelligence operatives. At its heart was President François Mitterrand, who had operated through senior army officers: General Christian <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=APMavTJucM4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=huchon+rwanda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VZh25KspT5&amp;sig=vSj4WGZBbSzkA_v3kXudHC78-II&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g3vyUsfUBMW47Qay7ICIAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=huchon%20rwanda&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Quesnot</a>, Admiral <a href=\"http://www.archiverwanda.net/+-Lanxade-Jacques-Amiral-+\" title=\"\">Jacques Lanxade</a> and General <a href=\"http://www.voltairenet.org/article1286.html\" title=\"\">Jean-Pierre Huchon</a>.</p><p>The prosecution testimony in the trial will be unprecedented in the detail it will provide about the genocide. The evidence combines the results of investigations into the Simbikangwa case at the <a href=\"http://www.unictr.org\" title=\"\">international criminal tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR), and details from investigations carried by Rwandan authorities. Never before, not even in the courtrooms of the ICTR, has such an impressive array of witnesses assembled. It is hoped that their combined testimony will put paid to a campaign of denial waged by defence lawyers at the ICTR who claimed the killing in Rwanda was not the result of a conspiracy but was somehow \"spontaneous\".</p><p>Simbikangwa's prosecutors are concentrating on his role during the killing, when he allegedly encouraged the murder of Tutsi by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interahamwe\" title=\"\">Interahamwe</a> militia on roadblocks and provided them&nbsp;with weapons. The roadblocks and&nbsp;the Interahamwe were an integral&nbsp;part of the planned killing mechanism and ensured the speed&nbsp;and scale of&nbsp;the slaughter.</p><p>But the impact of the Simbikangwa trial will be felt far beyond the courtroom. It is hoped that for the French public the nature of the genocide will be&nbsp;laid bare, and that at long last a debate about France and Rwanda will begin.

Leaked documents show that Gavin Williamson, the prime minister's parliamentary private secretary, has been sending a circular email around his backbenchers at about 11am every Wednesday, with a list of suggested \"free hits\" they could ask at midday.</p><p>The revelation comes shortly after John Bercow, the speaker, warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/02/speaker-john-bercow-control-mps\" title=\"\">soundbites and planted questions</a> have helped to damage the reputation of parliament in the eyes of the public. Really, John? On behalf of the public, let me suggest that the problems go a little deeper than that.</p><p>On the spectrum of stage-managed spectacles, one is tempted to place PMQs somewhere between a Punch and Judy show, a pantomime and a farce. This would be a great injustice. Those noble theatrical traditions have brought joy, laughter and colour into our lives for centuries; PMQs has brought nothing but shame and disgrace. The weekly performance is an embarrassment, the nadir of our anachronistic, elitist, dysfunctional parliamentary system.</p><p>I despise the ritual and the disingenuous cheek of the non-question: \"Does the prime minister have any plans to visit my home town in the near future, and if so would he care to observe the excellent new one-way traffic system we have installed in my constituency?\" The non-answer is worse. I long for a prime minister to reply: \"I'm sorry to inform the honourable gentleman that his constituency is by all accounts a rancid, concrete cesspit that is crawling with barbarians, heathens, oiks and riff raff and I'd sooner submit to root canal surgery than accept his generous offer.\"</p><p>Many observers point to the subhuman howling, braying and barking of the soundtrack as the worst feature of PMQs. In truth, I could just about tolerate that if it were accompanied by some authentic, animalistic hatred, meaning and purpose. I want my politicians to loathe each other. Too often, what we hear is not the explosion of righteous outrage but the ritualistic, synthetic foley  effects to a tedious, role-playing game, a tokenistic hear-hear-harr-harr-huh-huh-rhubarb. As Macbeth called life itself, a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p><p>Parliamentary correspondents and the professional political media love the occasion, of course. It is five minutes of guaranteed filler for the evening news or their weekly columns, with the performances of the prime minister and leader of the opposition reviewed and rated as if they were prizefighters, complete with descriptions of antagonists \"landing a few blows\" and \"throwing jabs\", when professional wrestling would be a more appropriate metaphor. It provides an easy narrative of winners and losers, a weekly opportunity for all the players, including those in the galleries, to feel like they are part of something that matters, something that counts.</p><p>They are kidding themselves. The Romans talked of bread and circuses as the key to keeping the plebs placated. PMQs affects to be politics, but in truth it is the biggest circus of all, a diversionary charade performed to convince us that we are being governed by a democratic process. When was the last time a point was made or a question was asked during PMQs that went on to influence and affect political administration? I'd hazard a confident guess that the answer is never.</p><p>As Douglas Adams noted long ago, a politician is a professional entertainer whose job is to distract the masses so the people who actually run the world can go about their business in peace. Nowhere is this writ larger than PMQs. Members of parliament can do a good job of holding power to account, at times. It occasionally happens with a speech in the chamber – think of the resignations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/31/heseltine-thatcher-westland-cabinet-meeting\" title=\"\">Michael Heseltine over Westland</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/06/greatest-speeches-in-parliament-of-the-past-100-years\" title=\"\">Robin Cook over Iraq</a> – but more often in the backrooms of parliament. Consider how Tom Watson and the culture, media and sport committee painstakingly unpicked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">the phone-hacking scandal</a>, for example. Such historic moments simply cannot happen at PMQs.</p><p>Bercow says he would like to consider prime minister's questions as a shop window on the work of the Commons. It is a forlorn hope. PMQs does not just demonstrate British parliamentary democracy at its worst; it represents everything that is wrong with it. If we are ever to transform the Palace of Westminster from a 17th-century public school debating club into a functional, modern seat of government, then this grotesque ritual has to be the first thing to go.</p>","headline":"Stage-managed PMQs?

The footage showed the interior of the Yandina pub; we were looking through an eye in the sky at a group of men having a beer at the bar. It got slightly more interesting when the footage switched outside and someone delivered a pizza.</p><p>I had to repress a desire to laugh or whoop loudly, an urge that always arises in funereal atmospheres that involve something absurd. Sitting quietly beside me were the wives, friends and family of the men: a fairly ordinary-looking group of Sunshine Coast residents, with nothing that screamed, \"Vicious Lawless Associate\". The man in the brown shirt sitting in the dock didn’t look to be the frothing-at-the-mouth type the title of the legislation (the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.legislation.qld.gov.au%2FBills%2F54PDF%2F2013%2FVicLawAssDisB13.pdf&amp;ei=V77yUsmfBsiykgWAjIG4Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwFKZ4IsvqprZSC0vT7qa52k0jUw&amp;sig2=n2ieqXhh3K4mVnkeF0QD-A&amp;bvm=bv.60799247,d.dGI\">Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act</a>) suggested. He told his lawyer he was dying for a smoke.</p><p>I was at the bail application for the five Yandina men who were caught fraternising at the local pub, an activity that is now outlawed for certain groups of people. The men are allegedly part of the Rebels motorcycle club, one of the 26 newly-designated criminal organisations. Under the laws, if three or more so-called gang members gather, they face imprisonment in solitary confinement for six months. If being locked in a prison cell for 22­–23 hours each day isn’t enough, <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/metal-walls-erected-outside-prison-cells-of-bikies-at-arthur-gorrie-correctional-centre/story-fnihsrf2-1226786181867\">metal walls</a> have been erected outside some prison windows at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional centre to block out signs of life.</p><p>Chief magistrate Tim Carmody, after watching the video for a few minutes, commented that there wasn’t much of a plot. Nonetheless, within a few minutes, it was obvious that some of these guys wouldn’t be granted bail.</p><p>Carmody, a former policeman, had initially put himself in charge of all disputed bail applications by accused bikies. In a recent <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/queensland-chief-magistrate-tim-carmody-warns-judiciary-against-using-position-to-criticise-new-laws/story-fnihsrf2-1226812904278\">Courier Mail</a> article, he admonished the judiciary for criticising the new laws.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The courts will be vulnerable to criticism, for example, if their members use the weight of their office to engage in the public debate or make comments about the comparative morality or fairness of regular laws regardless of which political party sponsored them, or routinely adopted approaches to bail or sentencing practices clearly at odds with legislative or administrative policy intents or legitimate criminal justice objects such as deterrence or community protection via hard line incapacitation strategies.</p></blockquote><p>What happens when the laws are patently unjust? Are judges expected to stay silent simply because parliament is \"supreme\"? Silence doesn’t seem the best option when the Liberal national party has a majority in parliament, there is no upper house, and bills are rushed through without much consultation with legal or community groups.</p><p>Judges in the US have <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/111813-lwop-complete-report.pdf\">criticised mandatory sentences</a> for people who are given life without parole (LWOP) for non-violent crimes for the simple reason that the sentences – and the laws that give them teeth – are unconscionable and hideously unjust. In the US, a tough-on-crime policy that started in the 1960s, and has continued unabated ever since, has led to a mania for mandatory sentencing.</p><p>A federal district court judge recently made his opinions clear when he handed down the sentence of LWOP to a man who sold crack cocaine to support his drug habit:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think a life sentence for what you have done in this case is ridiculous. It is a travesty. I don’t have any discretion about it. I don’t agree with it, either. And I want the world and the record to be clear on that. This is just silly. But as I say, I don’t have any choice.</p></blockquote><p>A thought kept circling in my mind that day in court – exactly what crime had these men committed? Some of the men had previous encounters with the law, mainly involving drugs. The man that delivered the pizza, Joshua Carew, had a 2012 suspended jail sentence for possession of cocaine and was recently fined over possession of speed and firearms. But this time he wasn’t in court over crimes like trafficking or possession, that require solid evidence. This was six months solitary for association.</p><p>Simply by virtue of their alleged membership, the supposed gang members are deemed an \"unacceptable risk to society\". Carmody used an analogy where he suggested that if a person were a member of a rugby or cricket team, the chances were that he or she was going to run on the field with the other members. The person needed to prove that he or she was not going to run on the field.</p><p>The presumption against bail means that the lawyers need to show cause as to why the men should be released.</p><p>I’m troubled by the idea that a person’s membership of a club and their criminal history can be used as predictive of future conduct – effectively imprisoning a person because they may commit a crime in the future. Ultimately it means a presumption of guilt rather than innocence, a reversal of the usual legal principle. It is saying that these people aren’t simply enjoying a beer but are, more likely than not, planning future crimes.</p><p>Of the five men who came before the judge, three were denied bail. Two men, Paul Landsdowne and Joshua Carew, spent time in solitary over Christmas but were later released by supreme court judges. One of the five men, Steven Smith, remains in solitary.</p><p>Speaking of his <a href=\"http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/dads-beeline-for-kids/2141108/\">six weeks locked up in a cell for 23 hours</a> for all but four days, Carew said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>You start hearing voices and you are talking to yourself. Some have been in there for four months.</p></blockquote><p>It is well documented that solitary confinement has the <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/australia/australian-notes/9128282/australian-notes-200/\">propensity to send relatively sane people completely mad</a>.</p><p>The aim of all this – criminalising an organisation, restricting associations with members, the presumption against bail, solitary confinement, six months mandatory – is to dismantle bikie clubs. Being a member of a blacklisted organisation means, in the words of Carmody, that \"every time you pop your head up you’re going to attract the risk of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment … eventually if that happens to you often enough you’ll change your friendship group.\"</p><p>Obvious questions remain: if people have indeed been involved in criminal activities, why can’t the police use standard methods of investigation, following the money trail, say, or using other traditional means of gathering evidence? Isn’t criminalising association just relieving the burden of producing evidence for actual crimes committed?</p><p>The reasons why a group is designated a \"criminal organisation\" <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/bikie-evidence-to-be-secret-forever-20140115-30vg3.html\">remain secret</a>. In the past police provided evidence to a supreme court judge to have a particular group declared a criminal organisation by a court. Now the details are kept secret and the evidence can’t be heard by a judge because \"making [it] public could jeopardise police operations or public safety\".</p><p>Attorney-general Jarrod Bleijie has explained that the designations are based on police evidence and criminal histories. And that is it: the declarations of the executive are conceived as so inherently right and benign that there is no need for transparency or opportunities for challenge.</p><p>It doesn’t stretch the imagination too much to consider that such declarations could, sometime in the future, be used to declare a politically inconvenient and bothersome organisation criminal.</p><p>Recently, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/06/victorian-bikie-gang-suspects-charged-under-queensland-anti-association-laws\">five alleged Victorian bikies</a> were arrested under the new laws on the Gold Coast. They were stopped by police on their way to buy ice cream after having Chinese food for dinner and were arrested days later. The first woman, Sally Kuether, faced court under the new laws after <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/how-council-librarian-mum-sally-louise-keuther-became-an-accused-outlaw-bikie-after-meeting-phillip-crow-frederick-palmer/story-fnihsrf2-1226810926202\">CCTV footage</a> showed her with two alleged bikies inside a Dayboro hotel. She was apparently wearing colours: a \"Life and Death\" vest with the words \"Property of the Crow\" on it. Her bail application went before Brisbane magistrate Noel Nunan and was successful. She had spent more than a week in the watch house prior to appearing in court.</p><p>Premier Newman said that he doesn’t <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/newman-says-he-doesnt-like-his-governments-bikie-laws-20140113-30qsc.html\">\"particularly like\"</a> the laws and plans to repeal them after a three year review. A review of the legislation in 2016 is cold comfort for those currently before the courts potentially facing mandatory sentences in solitary. Newman has accused the \"other side\" of launching a \"sophisticated PR campaign\"; the \"branding\" of the Yandina 5 as \"human rights victims\". I’m not sure a Facebook page and the sale of T-shirts is what you would call a sophisticated PR campaign. In response, the Liberal national party has been looking to appoint <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-24/librarian-is-first-woman-charged-under-anti-bikie-laws/5218212\">PR consultants</a> to promote the new laws, the cost of which is estimated to be around $500,000.</p><p>An essential, critical point has been entirely lost on Newman – a point that is easily lost on someone who is trying to establish power through a hard line law and order policy. Freedom of association is considered a fundamental human right, set down in Article 20 of the UDHR: \"everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association\". We seem to accept state imposed limitations on our individual freedom for the purposes of security, to protect us from the harm another may inflict on us. The social \"evil\" that the government is trying to protect us from in this case is \"criminal bikie gangs\" – and we have to ask whether the forms of social control that the government has imposed is warranted. I’m convinced that they aren’t.</p><p>Isaiah Berlin says in his essay <a href=\"http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/wiso_vwl/johannes/Ankuendigungen/Berlin_twoconceptsofliberty.pdf\">Two Concepts of Liberty</a> that the limits of our freedom will always be a source of infinite debate. He writes that Jefferson, Burke, Paine and Mill developed similar arguments as to why authority should be kept at bay: \"we must preserve a minimum area of personal freedom if we are not to degrade or deny our nature\". </p><p>To associate freely, to speak freely, to protest against injustice and to wear what we wish surely relates to that. Restrictions on association, no matter how well intended, potentially lead to two outcomes: a lurch toward despotism, or a crushing imposition of social conformity.</p><p>Let’s hope no other state or territory follows the lunacy currently playing out in Queensland.</p><p>• This piece originally appeared on <a href=\"http://overland.org.au/2014/02/six-months-solitary-for-association/\">Overland</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/guardian-comment-network\">Guardian Comment Network</a></p>","headline":"In Queensland, drinking with the wrong crowd can get you six months in solitary","trailText":"<b>Ella Humphreys for Overland: </b><i></i>In the context of a brutal crackdown on bike gang members, new authoritarian laws can essentially lead to someone's imprisonment because they may commit a crime in the future","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfqf","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391640007664/71af6981-13b5-4e4c-abe2-8eda5c118c51-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391640007664/71af6981-13b5-4e4c-abe2-8eda5c118c51-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1673","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429018280","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2bcd0e4b0ab978b0f9715","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ella Humphreys for Overland","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039001","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T10:00:52+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/in-queensland-drinking-with-the-wrong-crowd-can-get-you-six-months-in-solitary","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/in-queensland-drinking-with-the-wrong-crowd-can-get-you-six-months-in-solitary","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/queensland","webTitle":"Queensland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/queensland","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/queensland","references":[]},{"id":"world/queensland-politics","webTitle":"Queensland politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/queensland-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/queensland-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"law/civil-liberties-international","webTitle":"Civil liberties -

Some beautiful writing has eulogised the man and his achievements with a sensitive address to his struggle with his known disease – that of addiction.<br></p><p>Addiction is an illness that both kills most of those who have it, and traumatises any who love or live with its sufferers. To say it's a harsh experience doesn't even begin to cover it, for its symptoms are not limited to its physical horrors – sweats, shits, insomnia, vomits, nausea, embolisms, oedemas, instability and constant infections – but also its mutilations of character. The narcissism of those in thrall to the obsession of chemical need – so overpowering that it recruits everyone around the addict into supplying the drug or facilitating its use – comes at a cost of every category in the human experience; social, emotional, sexual, financial. </p><p>I use the word “drug” as a catch-all for the many various substances that feed addiction, of course; there are addicts of all kinds, all around us. The food addict, the gambling addict, the sex addict, the debt addict – all are caught in a similar chemical cycle of need, pursuit and withdrawal, as well as the mental torture of shame and remorse that, in addiction’s sickest twist, create the psychological justification to excuse, just one more time, the use of the drug for relief.</p><p>Simply put, addiction is ugly. Yet what the evolution of the vast fellowships of the recovery community that began with <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.org.au%2F&amp;ei=4pXxUqnkG8_slAWb-4HgAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkTiJtbWDcJyCBmuEEP-lt2Wyssw&amp;sig2=cdYivLbllbfhzJ02l4mCgw&amp;bvm=bv.60444564,d.dGI\">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> have taught us is that the cruel behaviour of the addict is the syndrome of the disease, not the instinct of the human being underneath it. </p><p>Even so, media discussion of addiction so often falls into the old tropes of addiction: that it is an individual’s own weakness, or a failure of willpower or self-control. Combine this stigmatising judgment with observable anti-social behaviour and the character of any suffering addict emerges in the popular consciousness as a hate-worthy monster. </p><p>Now that Philip Seymour Hoffman is dead, the protocol of eulogy pities his illness. The living are not so lucky. Witness what happened this week to Australian swimmer <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2F2014%2Ffeb%2F03%2Fian-thorpe-rehab-depression-swimming&amp;ei=VpbxUu-iM8SWkQXG_YA4&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2r9ZIurVWiEPoOD6oaPXq8vQ3CA&amp;sig2=q95WBWAe5ucz7K5rAb_lYg&amp;bvm=bv.60444564,d.dGI\">Ian Thorpe</a>.</p><p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/ian-thorpe-heads-home-after-sydney-hospital-stay-for-depression-and-alcohol-abuse/story-fnii5s3x-1226814426052\">contrary to some reports</a>, Ian Thorpe did not enter rehab this week for alcohol addiction but for depression. The swimmer – whose attempted sporting comeback was prevented by a shoulder injury – is recovering from surgery, and taking a combination of painkillers and anti-depressants. The presumption that Thorpe was being treated for alcohol abuse is derived from his honest <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/swimming/a-mist-of-disgrace-20121015-27lv0.html\">admission in his 2012 autobiography of drinking too much to combat depression</a>, and also that he was found by police this week in a disoriented state, trying to enter a car that wasn’t his. </p><p>The incident has been splashed across the media for days, but none of it exposes Thorpe as an alcoholic. Most importantly, it's also none of anyone’s business what his specific health concerns are. The point is, Thorpe is clearly ill and seeking treatment to become well. </p><p>What’s really been exposed is that every single person who is struggling with an addiction and who’s watched the character assassination of Thorpe at his most vulnerable now has legitimate reasons to fear being publicly demonised. The old tropes of character weakness and personal failure may be stale, but they are palpable and they are everywhere. Thorpe may not actually be an addict, but his treatment by a media who believed that he was one is shameful. </p><p>What’s extraordinary is that it has been known by the broader community for decades that any addict who takes steps towards recovery must do so with minimum interference in order to receive the best chance of overcoming their illness. The dead giveaway is that the word “Anonymous” appears as half of the name of all the fellowships that exist to nurture and support addicts towards wellness. </p><p>Addicts go into the recovery communities so they can progress towards wellness free of judgment and stigma, unburdened by the shame and remorse that habitually inspires them to keep using. By hounding Thorpe so invasively and publicly this week, the message sent to every suffering addict is that not only is their condition monstrous, their attempts at rehabilitation will be met with public dissection, complete exposure and ongoing humiliation. </p><p>I only hope the attention does not destroy Thorpe, for it is guaranteed to ensure the destruction of countless more Philip Seymour Hoffmans.</p><p>• This article was amended on 5 February 2014. It originally stated that Ian Thorpe's autobiography was published in 2013. This has now been corrected.</p>","headline":"The hounding of Ian Thorpe sends a catastrophic message","trailText":"<b>Van Badham: </b>Thorpe may not actually be an addict, but his treatment by the media will make it even harder for those who are to seek the help they need","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfxb","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391562999925/4687962584_2260f9020f_o-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391562999925/4687962584_2260f9020f_o-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"775","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428934042","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f18dede4b0625066fcb5c6","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Van Badham","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038322","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T13:15:41+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/the-hounding-of-ian-thorpe-sends-a-catastrophic-message","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/the-hounding-of-ian-thorpe-sends-a-catastrophic-message","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/alcohol","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/alcohol","references":[]},{"id":"society/alcoholism","webTitle":"Alcoholism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/alcoholism","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/alcoholism","references":[]},{"id":"science/drugs","webTitle":"Drugs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/drugs","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/science/drugs","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"society/depression","webTitle":"Depression","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/depression","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/depression","references":[]},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/health","references":[]},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/mental-health","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/van-badham","webTitle":"Van Badham","r2ContributorId":"56537","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/17/1387250999406/van_badham.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Van Badham is a theatre-maker and novelist, occasional broadcaster and critic, feminist, bogan and trollfighter.

How very dare you! they seem to protest, despite having usually agreed that unviable local industries like car manufacturing should accept the inevitable and call it a day.</p><p>Shouldn’t unviable farms do the same? Granted, farmers are facing the twin challenges of sustained dry conditions and minimal tariff protection. They’re at the mercy of factors totally outside their control, but is that much different from the local car manufacturers having to deal with a sustained high dollar and, er … <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/190829491/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-2m5w1objvjalmfsdwru4\">minimal tariff protection</a>?</p><p>Aside from the location of their operations, what is the difference between workers on the Holden and SPC factory lines? Not a great deal. “But think of the farmers!” I hear you cry. “They’re the salt of the earth. They run <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features10Dec+2012\">family businesses</a>. And they made our nation what it is today.”</p><p>Yes, that’s true. But the mining industry also made Australia what it is today. And the services sector. And our defence forces. The fact that Australian farms are <a href=\"http://www.nff.org.au/farm-facts.html\">almost entirely</a> family owned and operated should not make them a protected species. Plenty of other unviable family businesses go to the wall in Australia and farm businesses shouldn’t be sacrosanct.</p><p>Food security is another red herring dangled in defence of our agricultural brethren. Yet Australian farmers currently supply 93% of the food we eat and still have two thirds of their produce left to <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features10Dec+2012#What%20are\">export</a>. So we’re <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com.au/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/17/bob-katter/within-three-eight-years-australia-will-be-net-imp/\">not facing any imminent risk</a> of having to depend on other nations for food, even if some of the 300,000 farming jobs are lost. </p><p>We do however import more processed fruit and vegetables than we export, which is why food-processing companies like SPC Ardmona are under pressure from foreign competitors with cheaper input costs. As are the local car manufacturing industry, and the textiles, clothing and footwear sector, just to name two other examples.</p><p>The real reason farm jobs are treated as a special case is because they have a parliamentary cheer squad: a casual trawl through the register of pecuniary interests shows the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Members/Register\">members</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Senators_Interests/Register\">senators</a> who also run family farms and earn additional income from their businesses, however modest that income might be. </p><p>Owning and operating a farm doesn’t appear to preclude these parliamentarians from agricultural committees or inquiries that might pose a conflict of interest – indeed a commercial interest could be said to be an apparent prequalification. It’s extraordinary that no other part of the Australian economy is similarly represented in parliament with such potential vested interests – other than the dinosaur and Titanic-restoration industries of course.</p><p>The simple fact is that farm businesses made unviable by weather, interest rates, the dollar, tariffs, or labor costs should no more be propped up by government than any other unsustainable business. Even the government’s own rural <a href=\"http://www.daff.gov.au/agriculture-food/drought/assistance\">assistance measures</a> seem to recognise this by focusing on preparedness and risk-management for farms under stress. </p><p>While Stone’s crash through or crash performance was certainly diverting, her neighbour in the adjoining electorate of Indi also made an interesting contribution to the SPCA debate yesterday. Drawing on her expertise as an agricultural consultant, whose role is to advise farmers on the best ways to run their operations, independent MP Cathy McGowan refrained from condemning the SPCA decision and opted instead to call for a \"<a href=\"http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/politics/indi-mp-cathy-mcgowan-supports-mining-magnate-mp-clive-palmer/story-fnkerdda-1226817548860\" style=\"font-size: 15px;\">national debate about what's the future for manufacturing for rural and regional Australia</a>.”</p><p>Stone is rallying for hearts, while McGowan is appealing to minds. It will be interesting to see which of the two parliamentarians’ remonstrations ultimately prevail.</p>","headline":"Australian farmers should not be treated like protected species","trailText":"<b>Paula Matthewson: </b><i></i>The fact that Australian farms are almost entirely family owned and operated should not make them a special case more worthy of government assistance than other professions","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgv2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391646119491/c5d80740-7703-49f8-8954-de5cdc48ad4a-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391646119491/c5d80740-7703-49f8-8954-de5cdc48ad4a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"675","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429020394","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2c6efe4b0ab978b0f9720","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paula Matthewson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039015","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T11:30:32+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/australian-farmers-should-not-be-treated-like-protected-species","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/australian-farmers-should-not-be-treated-like-protected-species","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"environment/farming","webTitle":"Farming","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/farming","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"business/spc-ardmona","webTitle":"SPC Ardmona","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/spc-ardmona","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/spc-ardmona","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/liberal-party","webTitle":"Liberal party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberal-party","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/liberal-party","references":[]},{"id":"world/national-party","webTitle":"National party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/national-party","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/national-party","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paula-matthewson","webTitle":"Paula Matthewson","r2ContributorId":"56624","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/24/1369356496226/paula_matthewson.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paula Matthewson was media adviser to John Howard in the early 1990s and then had a long career as an industry lobbyist.

From the first time I got drunk, at 14 – having boldly decided that a two-litre bottle of <a href=\"http://gk007a0336.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/white.htm\" title=\"\">White Lightning</a> cider was the best way to get over a breakup (and land me in hospital) – to guzzling beer through a funnel while at university, to present-day bouts of getting hammered in the kitchen, it's been a bumpy, sick-making ride. And, despite the fact my hangovers have begun to transmogrify from tolerable annoyances into day-long periods of apocalyptic torture, I'm still doing it. Like many others, I ignore the health risks and the horror stories, because, in all honesty, I love drinking.</p><p>It hardly needs stating that the UK and Ireland have a binge-drinking problem with the potential for fatal consequences. A 19-year-old, Jonny Byrne, died on Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/03/neknomination-facebook-binge-drinking-death-ireland\" title=\"\">after downing a pint and jumping into a river as part of a game called NekNomination</a>. The game, from what I can gather, is imported from Australia, another country that struggles with moderation (this week a young woman there inexplicably swallowed a goldfish while playing the same game). And police suspect that Megan Roberts, a teenager who went missing in York in late January, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/29/megan-roberts-disappearance-public-river-search\" title=\"\">may have fallen into the river Ouse</a> after a night of drinking.</p><p>Understandably, tragic stories such as these tend to provoke moral panic. While ministers have dropped minimum alcohol pricing proposals, the Home Office is still intending to use existing licensing regulations in order to prevent supermarkets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/04/sale-ultra-cheap-alcohol-banned\" title=\"\">selling alcohol at below cost</a>. Not only are these measures likely to have an impact only on a mere 1.3% of sales, they also ignore several underlying factors. Alcohol is dirt cheap elsewhere in Europe, but in countries such as France and Italy – where alcohol is consumed regularly but in a leisurely, aperitif fashion, often while smoking and looking out on to a piazza – there is no \"binge-drinking epidemic\". France&nbsp;(a nation that, according to World Health Organisation statistics, actually drinks more than us) points and laughs at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/france-binge-drinking-beuverie-express\" title=\"\"><em>le binge drinking</em></a> across the Channel. We have an issue with so-called drinking urgency that extending pub opening times hasn't tackled.</p><p>I have a theory about Britain's bingeing but it is, admittedly, one that I came up with in the pub. I've come to believe that our small island has a unique combination of factors that results in our seemingly indefatigable urge to get wasted. It has roots in our class system, which has seen the rich stockpile wealth and the poor go from the medieval alehouses that flourished in the wake of the Black Death to Wetherspoons, via Hogarth's Beer Street and Gin Lane.</p><p>The industrial revolution gave birth to the modern pattern of alternating monotonous, silent work with noisy, drunken piss-ups. Now we work more hours than any other country in Europe. By contrast, many French people still take two hours at lunch.</p><p>It's the crappy weather, too, the atavistic lure of a roaring fire and the warmth of the pub on dark winter afternoons. Historically pubs gave the overcrowded, urban poor a surrogate home away from the slums, which is perhaps why so many of them still feel like someone's living room. We're losing some of that now, but the need for a short, sharp burst of comfort remains, and can be seen echoed in modern, competitive drinking games.</p><p>It's also, I think, a nationwide lack of confidence, an emotional reserve. This is a cliche, but one that's undeniable in the face of all those boozed-up first kisses and late-night street rows between red-faced people rattling with repressed anger, like pressure cookers. Combine that with the lure of the taboo created by a society that tells parents not to let their children see them drink, and you end up with a country of bloated drunkards (myself included) whose habits are impossible to legislate away.</p><p>No law is a match for the centuries-old need for a few hours of joyful, rebellious oblivion. How a government could ever go about sobering us up effectively is anyone's guess, but I do know one thing: we'll drink whatever the cost.</p>","headline":"Stay sober?

Religious minorities should be better protected</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-05T22:22:02.474Z","body":"<p>Exactly three years ago, on 6 February 2011, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/06/16/indonesia-monitor-trials-deadly-attack-religious-minority\">some 1,500 Islamist militants stormed the Ahmadiyah community in Cikeusik village</a> in western Java.  In this exceptionally brutal assault, which was captured on video,  the attackers  beat three Ahmadiyah men to death and seriously injured five others. Gruesome  footage of the violence circulated widely on the internet, shocking Indonesians and the world. Police ultimately used the video evidence to identify several perpetrators, 12 of whom were convicted but <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/07/28/indonesia-verdicts-setback-religious-freedom\" style=\"font-size: 15px;\">given lenient sentences from three to six months’ imprisonment</a>. </p><p>Neighbouring governments like Australia have good reason for concern about the Indonesian government’s apparently inability or unwillingness to protect the Ahmadiyah, a Muslim sect, and other religious minorities from bigoted thugs who act with apparent impunity. </p><p>Two weeks ago, a survivor of that horrific attack, Acmad Masihuddin, accompanied me to visit several Ahmadiyah communities in the hills outside Jakarta. Masihuddin told me how that fateful day he tried to run away.  Members of the mob caught him and dragged him back, stripping him to his underwear, and beat him with a hoe and machete, until a police officer pronounced him dead and put him in the back of a police van – saving his life.</p><p>Masihuddin, whose injuries required two years of treatment, still suffers from headaches and lost partial sight in one of his eyes. Now he works for one of Indonesia’s leading human rights groups, Kontras, to support victims of religious violence. Masihuddin told me, “I am working for Kontras, because I want to stop this from happening again.”</p><p>Three years after what should have been Indonesia’s wake up call to address religious violence, the  Ahmadiyah and  the country’s other religious minorities are under threat.  Across Indonesia, there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/human-rights-are-under-attack-in-post-tsunami-indonesia\">multiplying incidents of harassment, threats and violence</a> against religious minorities including several Christian groups, Shia and the Ahmadiyah. These groups have become targets of Islamist militant groups who label most non-Muslims as “infidels,” and Muslims who do not adhere to Sunni orthodoxy as “blasphemers.” Even Indonesia’s atheists live in fear of such groups.</p><p>Islamist militants have increasingly and often violently attacked Ahmadiyah since 2005 when Indonesia’s Ulama council, the MUI (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), declared a fatwa, or religious edict, ruling that the Ahmadiyah community deviated from Qur'anic teachings. In 2008, the government passed <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/09/indonesia-reverse-ban-ahmadiyah-sect\">a nationwide anti-Ahmadiyah decree</a> than bans the Ahmadiyah from proselytising their faith. The government justified this decree on the basis of reducing violence and promoting religious harmony. Instead, the number of attacks has steadily risen and more than 30 towns, regencies and provinces across Indonesia have followed suit, with some outright banning the Ahmadiyah as West Java province has.</p><p>I met with representatives of five Ahmadiyah communities in Sukadana, West Java, who described almost daily intimidation, harassment and discrimination, resulting in the closure of three Ahmadiyah mosques by local officials. Ulamas have preached sermons of hate and intolerance over loudspeakers and in some cases, started campaigns to avoid Ahmadiyah-owned businesses. “I get jittery every time I hear the ulamas speaking over the loudspeaker,” an Ahmadiyah woman told me.</p><p>Some Ahmadiyah have found it difficult to find jobs. Several men described bureaucratic hurdles when dealing with local officials or requesting new identification documents or building permits. Some Ahmadiyah teachers have been pressured to convert to Sunni Islam or transferred to remote schools when they resisted. Ahmadiyah children have also been bullied by classmates and teachers have pressured them to denounce their “heretical” religious views. Even hospitals are unwilling to accept Ahmadiyah blood, with one woman telling me, “We try to donate blood and we are refused, they say we don’t want Ahmadiyah blood. Only if it’s an emergency, then they come here and ask us.”</p><p>This sweeping ostracization of the Ahmadiyah is more insidious than the brutal violence of the Cikeusik attack, and just as dangerous.</p><p>Islamists have been emboldened by the success in repressing the Ahmadiyah and are also turning their attention to other minority groups, like the Shia, Bahai and Christians. A 2006 decree that requires religious groups to get permission from a significant number of community members before building a house of worship has been used to shut down not only around 30 Ahmadiyah mosques, but more than 500 Christian churches and several Buddhist temples as well.</p><p>Why should Australians care?</p><p>A neighbouring country that fails to act decisively in the face of religious violence and facilitates intolerance of other faiths in violation of Indonesia’s own Constitution risks destabilising the region. While Indonesia has done reasonably well in curbing terrorism, its enabling attitude towards intolerant Islamists may create threats which might spill over Indonesia’s borders.  Australia does not want to see <a href=\"http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/indonesia-risks-taking-pakistans-path-to-intolerance/\">Indonesia follow the path of Pakistan</a>, where a failure of accountability for violence against religious minorities has led to steady increases in violence against Ahmadiyah, Shia, and Christians.\"</p><p>To curb this trend of intolerance, the Indonesian government needs to act decisively. It can start by revoking discriminatory decrees as well as thoroughly investigating and punishing acts of religious violence. So far, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has claimed he has <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/01/sby-vows-address-religious-intolerance-upon-receiving-international-award.html\">“no tolerance” for religious violence</a> , yet has he repeatedly failed to back up that promise with action.  Australia and other key governments have leverage and should keep the pressure on Yudhoyono to address religious violence. </p>","headline":"Indonesia’s growing religious intolerance has to be addressed","trailText":"<b>Elaine Pearson: </b>On the third anniversary of a brutal attack by extremists Islamist which killed three Ahmadiyah men, religious intolerance remains.

It would be a powerful shift</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-05T17:14:34.688Z","body":"<p>Thirty or so years ago, two very dear friends were married in a nuptial mass, and for a gospel reading they chose Mark 10:2-9, which includes this passage:<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [and be joined to his wife], and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, no human being must separate.” </p></blockquote><p>Even in Jesus’ day, divorce was a theological challenge. </p><p>For the bride and groom the reading was a pledge of determination; one of them was still reeling from the recent divorce of parents married for over 20 years, and the subsequent remarriage of the mother.</p><p>The divorce created anxiety before the wedding: would the mother present herself for communion? We brilliant twentysomethings mused on it over wine and cheese, noting that from a purely legalistic view, the mother had ex-communicated herself by remarrying outside the church, and before attaining an annulment. Finally, in vino veritas, one pertinent fact came to the fore: “She never loved my father,” said our friend. “Her family wanted the marriage, and she was obedient,  but she never loved him.”</p><p>Oh. That does matter in the grand scheme of things – where sin and sacraments are concerned, intentions matter.</p><p>Prior to the divorce, this had been a family of practicing Catholics. Three decades later, the mother is fulfilled in her healthy, loving, second marriage but still removed from the church, as are all of her children and grandchildren. If you ask them, they will tell you they're Catholic, but only nominally; everyone has been baptized and confirmed, but no one attends Mass or observes Holy Days – not even Christmas. Whether the grandchildren will feel compelled to baptize their own children is unknowable, but we can hazard a guess. </p><p>Within four generations, a previously-faithful family has experienced a categorical move away from Catholicism, trending toward 21st century “None-ism” (a belief in not much of anything) and that trajectory can be traced to a civil divorce that was met by inadequate outreach and, likely, inadequate catechesis. </p><p>It's precisely because of stories like these that Pope Francis has called for an Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family. This month, in anticipation of it, the pope will meet with the eight cardinals who advise him to discuss the pastoral care of the modern family, which has been wracked by divorce, redefined by secular interests and the sexual revolution, and is in dire need of spiritual direction and large slices of capital \"T\" Truth, served up with generous dollops of mercy. </p><p>They will be looking at data culled from a recent questionnaire sent to diocese around the world, which asked specific questions about matters of divorce, same-sex partnerships and the children being raised within them, in preparation for October’s Synod. By all accounts the question of divorce and annulment will be a primary focus. </p><p>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger – while emphatically declaring the need to obey the teaching of Christ Jesus on the subject of marriage – noted “the church has the authority to clarify those conditions which must be fulfilled for a marriage to be considered indissoluble, according to the sense of Jesus’ teaching.”</p><p>In 2005, as Pope Benedict XVI, he reissued the essay with additional notes, touching on how the Council of Nicaea and the practices of Eastern Orthodoxy, along with a reasoned conscience, might expand our present understanding of marriage – particularly in the cases involving the “baptized-but-unbelieving\".</p><p>Particularly in his <a href=\"http://americamagazine.org/pope-interview\">interview with La Civiltà Cattolica</a>, Pope Francis has indicated that he is thinking along similar lines, and that is not surprising. He has called the church “<a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html\">a field hospital</a>” doing triage and treatment to a wounded world, and he seems intent on advancing the medicine of the Holy Eucharist to its patients: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>﻿The Eucharist, although it is the fullness of sacramental life, is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak. These convictions have pastoral consequences that we are called to consider with prudence and boldness. </p></blockquote><p>Those Catholics whose first marriages were doomed by reasons of coercion, ignorance or immaturity have been in the waiting room for a long time.
