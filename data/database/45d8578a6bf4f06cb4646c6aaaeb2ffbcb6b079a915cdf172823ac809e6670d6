We must all raise our voices against attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people,\" he said. \"We must oppose the arrests, imprisonments and discriminatory restrictions they face.\"</p><p>\"The United Nations stands strongly behind our own 'free and equal' campaign, and I look forward to working with the IOC, governments and other partners around the world to build societies of equality and tolerance. Hatred of any kind must have no place in the 21st century.\"</p><p>It emerged last week that more than 50 current and former Olympians have called on the IOC to uphold principle six of its charter, which forbids discrimination of any kind, and this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/06/sochi-games-anti-gay-blasphemy-laws-russia-putin-letter-writers\" title=\"\">more than 200 writers added their voice to the protest </a>against the new laws in a letter to the Guardian.</p><p>Ban did not refer specifically to Russia's new laws, which ban the promotion of \"non-traditional\" sexual relations to under-18s, but his words carry strong symbolic weight.</p><p>Speaking to reporters after his address, Ban, who is due to carry the Olympic torch and meet Putin in Sochi on Thursday, added: \"I know there has been some controversy over this issue. At the same time I appreciate the assurances of President Putin that there will be no discrimination and that people with different sexual orientation are welcome to compete and enjoy this Olympic Games.\"</p><p>Asked about the new laws, the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak insisted that there was no discrimination against anyone based on their \"religion or their sexuality or their nationality\". He said the new laws were to protect children.</p><p>\"We are all grown up and every adult has his or her right to understand their sexual activity. Please, do not touch kids. That's the only thing. That's prohibited by law in all countries whether you are gay or straight.\"</p><p>Kozak also appeared to highlight an apparent inconsistency between the IOC and the Russian organisers over the issue. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has said athletes should not protest against the issue on the medal podium but are free to speak out in press conferences.</p><p>But Kozak said: \"Political propaganda is prohibited during the sporting event. It is prohibited by the Olympic charter not by Russian law.\"</p><p>He also referred to renewed security concerns sparked by reports that US homeland security sources had warned that terrorists might try to smuggle explosives aboard flights bound for Sochi in toothpaste tubes.</p><p>The department said later in a statement that it was not aware of any specific threat.</p><p>Kozak said the security threat in Sochi, which is protected by a \"ring of steel\" of 40,000 troops, police and security personnel, was no more serious than any major American city.</p><p>\"I'm sure the security risk in Sochi is no more than in New York, Washington or Boston,\" he said, adding that the Russian security services were working with colleagues in the US and western Europe.</p><p>In December, suicide bombers killed 34 people in the Russian city of Volgograd, 400 miles north-east of Sochi. The attacks raised fears of further attacks during the Games.</p><p>A poll published by the Levada Centre, an  independent Russian research organisation, this week found that 53% of those surveyed thought Russia was right to host the Olympics,  26% said the country should not have tried to do so and 21% were undecided. When asked what they saw as the main reason behind authorities' desire to hold the games, 38% said it was \"opportunity for graft\" and only 23% said it was important for national pride and to serve for the development of sport.</p><p>About half of respondents put the record price tag of the Sochi games down to corruption.</p><p>When asked about the survey during the press conference, Kozak said  there was no evidence of \"any large-scale corruption or theft\" during the run-up to the Games, and that to say otherwise would \"violate the democratic principle of presumption of innocence\".</p>","headline":"Ban Ki-moon condemns persecution of gay people in Russia","trailText":"Amid criticism of Russia's anti-gay laws, UN secretary-general urges 'speaking out against prejudice' in keynote speech to IOC","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3y","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679090818/Ban-Ki-moon-makes-a-point-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391679090818/Ban-Ki-moon-makes-a-point-004.jpg","wordcount":"703","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429042643","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652120","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Gibson and Shaun Walker","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039115","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T09:47:41Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/sochi-olympics-ban-ki-moon-lgbt-prejudice","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/sochi-olympics-ban-ki-moon-lgbt-prejudice","tags":[{"id":"world/ban-ki-moon","webTitle":"Ban Ki-moon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ban-ki-moon","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/ban-ki-moon","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics-2014","webTitle":"Winter Olympics 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics","webTitle":"Winter Olympics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics","references":[]},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"society/equality","webTitle":"Equality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/equality","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/equality","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/owen_gibson_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

Locking children up should only be done in the most exceptional circumstances and as a measure of absolute last resort. These reforms turn that principle on its head and will result in prison being the norm, rather than the exception,” he said.</p><p>The deputy chair of the QLS’s children’s law committee, Damian Bartholomew, said the naming of young offenders and removal of detention as a last resort were particularly concerning aspects of the proposed changes.</p><p>When asked if the laws would reduce youth crime in Queensland, he said no.</p><p>“The Queensland Law Society’s position is that a punitive approach is not going to resolve any of the issues. It’s only going to be mean we’re going to have more young people moving through the detention system and that’s going to have a harmful effect upon their rehabilitation prospects,” he said.</p><p>The QLS is opposed to taking away judicial discretion by removing the last resort principle on detention and said it would ultimately lead to a heavier burden on the justice system, as well as increasing the chances young people would reoffend.</p><p>Bartholomew said the naming of young offenders was another concerning aspect of the proposals.</p><p>“I think you’ll see young people being alienated from their community. They’ll be stigmatised. It erodes, obviously, the child’s right to privacy but more significantly it creates unwanted attention that could make it difficult for the child to find employment,” he said.</p><p>“They’re often known in the community and it deters potential employers from employing them because of an unfortunate opportunistic crime a child may have committed at the early stage of their development.”</p><p>Families would also be affected by the naming laws, Bartholomew said, as they could be ostracised and blamed for their children’s crimes.</p><p>Bartholomew said the QLS had requested a draft of the legislation but was yet to receive it.</p><p>Queensland is the only state in Australia that tries 17-year-olds as adults and the QLS is urging Bleijie not only to abandon plans to transfer them to adult prisons after their birthday, but to stop classifying them as adults at all.</p><p>Bleijie drew the ire of the children’s commissioner over the trying of 17-year-olds as adults last year when, among other concerns, the prospect of rape was raised and he responded by saying <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-19/prisoners-not-being-raped-in-qld-jails-bleijie/4638566\">rape did not happen in jails</a>.</p><p>\"I reject that rape happens in jail. We have protections,\" he said. \"I did actually visit all our jails.

Under that policy, farmers who passed an assets test were paid subsidies of up to $100,000 each year for a maximum five years in drought-declared areas.<br></p><p>Interest payments remain a key plank of National party policy. However, in a week when the treasurer, Joe Hockey, declared the end of the “age of entitlement”, there appears to be little support among Liberal ranks for the payments, even among rural MPs.<br></p><p>Nationals senator John Williams called for a return to interest subsidies to address debt, which he described as the biggest issue for farmers facing drought. He said farmers were worse off due to the actions of the previous government, which temporarily stopped the live animal export trade after allegations of animal cruelty. Williams also blamed Labor for the high dollar.<br></p><p>“We’ve got generations of people on the land with huge experience and know-how,” Williams told the ABC. “They are the best people to run that land and when governments help to bring them down then governments should help to stand them back up.<br></p><p>“We need to support our farmers through three good seasons – average rain, good commodity prices, low interest rates – to let our farmers get back on their feet, then they can cope for themselves.”<br></p><p>But the Labor agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said bringing forward the farm household allowance would not make a big difference to farmers. He called on the government to reduce the concessional interest rate for drought-affected farms and convene state and territory ministers through the Council of Australian Government process to complete national drought reform.<br></p><p>“While any bring-forward would be welcomed, there is little difference between the post 1 July  regime and the current transitional farm household payment which is in place to bridge the gap between the old Exceptional Circumstances payment and the new 1 July  payment,” Fitzgibbon said.<br></p><p>The NSW Farmers Association president, Fiona Simson, welcomed the move to bring forward the farm household allowance but warned that any long-term drought policy would require a “multifaceted approach” with major government investment in the agricultural industry and rural communities.<br></p><p>Simson also said the new farm household allowance contained an assets test which ruled out most farm businesses by capping eligibility for assets at $1.5m, including the farm. Assets and viability tests also applied to concessional loans, where farms could swap private debt for a lower rate government loan. It is understood the government is considering a relaxation of the eligibility criteria.<br></p><p>“Any recognition now by the government of drought is good but as we’ve said for a long time, drought does not just affect farmers, it affects communities,” Simson said.<br></p><p>She called for a debate on innovative ideas to support agriculture and rural communities.<br></p><p>She raised two schemes to address farms shedding workers during natural disasters such as drought. The first was a regional employment development scheme used in the 1970s to employ people in regional areas to support local infrastructure projects. The second was a drought employment support program where the unemployment payment was paid to the farmer to keep on workers during drought when extra labour was even more crucial.<br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“Whilst small Band-aid solutions are good, we also need a full suite of policies. It’s going to take a large investment and it is up to the government what form it takes,” she said.</span><br></p>","headline":"Tony Abbott to bring forward income support for drought-hit farmers","trailText":"Package will put food on the table but government has yet to finalise package to help farms with interest, feed or water","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgxq","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664415109/b5b7e8f8-fbbc-43b6-bac8-541b05573cea-140x84.png","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664415109/b5b7e8f8-fbbc-43b6-bac8-541b05573cea-140x84.png","wordcount":"759","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429030491","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f318d0e4b0530e249db044","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Gabrielle Chan","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039066","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T05:34:11Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/abbott-brings-forward-drought-income-support","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/abbott-brings-forward-drought-income-support","tags":[{"id":"world/rural-australia","webTitle":"Rural Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/rural-australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/rural-australia","references":[]},{"id":"environment/drought","webTitle":"Drought","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/drought","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/drought","references":[]},{"id":"environment/farming","webTitle":"Farming","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/farming","references":[]},{"id":"world/barnaby-joyce","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barnaby-joyce","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/barnaby-joyce","references":[]},{"id":"world/tony-abbott","webTitle":"Tony Abbott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/tony-abbott","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/coalition","webTitle":"Coalition","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/coalition","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/coalition","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gabrielle-chan","webTitle":"Gabrielle Chan","r2ContributorId":"58017","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/7/1375846887937/Gabrielle-Chan.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Gabrielle Chan has been a journalist for 30 years.

Victorian manufacturing plants as it prepares to cease manufacturing.</p><p>Ford Australia’s director of communications, Wes Sherwood, said the company briefed union representatives and its manufacturing team on Thursday morning.</p><p>\"We are continuing to match production with demand and that will mean we are reducing production by about a third in June with related job losses,\" Sherwood said.</p><p>He said the number of job losses would be in line with the level of production, meaning about 300 positions.</p><p>\"We'll continue to work with the teams to get into the exact details but it will be about 300,\" he said.</p><p>Workers at the manufacturing plants in Geelong and Broadmeadows, in Melbourne's north, will be affected.</p><p>Sherwood said the exact numbers at each site were still being worked out.</p><p>Ford announced last May that it would cease local manufacturing in October 2016, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs at its Broadmeadows plant and 510 at the Geelong plant.</p><p>At the time Ford Australia president and CEO Bob Graziano said the cost of manufacturing cars in Australia was uncompetitive.</p><p>Sherwood said Ford currently had about 1,500 salaried employees including 1,000 engineers.</p><p>He said even with it ceasing local manufacturing in 2016, the company would be Australia's biggest automotive employer, given moves by other carmakers.</p><p>\"We expect by the end of the decade to be the largest automotive employer in the country,\" he said.</p><p>Ford will manufacture its Falcon and Territory models in Victoria until 2016.</p><p>Sherwood said the carmaker was committed to its plan to transform its Australian business, which included refocusing and expanding its entire line-up for customers by 2017.</p><p>\"We are on track for the launch of our new Falcon and Territory later this year,\" he said.</p><p>Sherwood said the market was shifting towards smaller vehicles, with demand for larger cars in decline.</p><p>\"We're just going to have to match production with demand.</p><p>\"Obviously there's been some cases where others have taken some pretty aggressive action in the marketplace, really discounting their vehicles to levels that are unprecedented.\"</p><p>The Victorian attorney general, Robert Clark, said he was yet to receive details of the Ford announcement.</p><p>\"I don't have full details, but the government remains committed to support Ford workers going forward as we have to date, as indeed to support all the workers in the car industry,\" Clark said.</p>","headline":"Ford confirms 300 jobs will be cut in June as it prepares for closure","trailText":"300 jobs will be cut in June, says Fairfax Radio, as Ford prepares to stop manufacturing cars

But why shouldn't Tiger Mother Amy Chua and her husband investigate the success of certain cultural and ethnic groups? The question is: are they right in their explanation of it?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-05T11:50:42Z","body":"<p>Asian-Americans make up about 5% of the US college-age population, and 19% of Harvard's undergraduate body. At Yale, that figure is 16%. At Princeton, 19%. And at the California Institute of Technology, where, argue the authors of&nbsp;<em>The Triple Package</em>, admissions are based solely on test scores rather than a combination of scores and more opaque criteria, a whopping 40% of undergraduates are Asian-American.</p><p>Figuring out why this might be is an enterprise fraught with danger, likely to trigger instant and loud accusations of racism. This is exactly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/08/tiger-mother-theory-cultural-group-jews-chinese\" title=\"\">what happened in the run-up to this book's US publication</a>, when it was variously described as \"a despicable new theory\" of \"racial superiority\" (Salon), espousing a \"racist argument\" (New York Post), and harbouring \"uncomfortable racist overtones\" (Forbes magazine).</p><p>The authors, Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld, both law professors at Yale, are a married couple. Chua is the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/31/battle-hymn-of-tiger-mother\" title=\"\"><em>Battle Hymn of&nbsp;the Tiger Mother</em></a>, the bestselling exposition and defence of strict Asian-American-style parenting. This book is a widening of that thesis to cover other \"cultural groups\" in the US – Mormons, Cubans, Nigerians, Jews, Indians, Lebanese and Iranians – groups that, by&nbsp;conventional measures of success, are disproportionately represented at the top of the league tables.</p><p>The squeamishness of the response to this new book implies that, given the abuses to which this kind of information has historically been put, it is never admissible to aggregate data and link ethnicity with performance – which is absurd. How groups behave is an area of legitimate academic concern, one which it is surely possible to explore without resorting to racist stereotypes.</p><p>Whether the authors' explanation as to why some groups thrive is valid is another question, and it's a problem with this kind of book that the marketing hook – in this case the \"triple package\", a clunky formulation the authors have chosen \"for lack of a less terrible name\" – is often too flimsy or too broad to be meaningful.</p><p>The three factors that make up the triple package and determine success, Chua and Rubenfeld argue, are insecurity (outsiderdom), a sense of superiority and good impulse control, which together make up a puritan mindset long ago abandoned by white Protest­ant America – a section of the population that now has below-average wealth. Immigrants from certain parts of the world these days tend to possess such a mindset, and it represents an advantage. (Whether or not it brings happiness is a question the book also fleetingly addresses.)</p><p>The upward mobility of some immigrant groups compared to others is startling. So \"Indian Americans have the highest income of any census-tracked ethnic group, almost twice the national average.\" Nigerian Americans, while representing 0.7% of the US black population, account for 10 times that percentage of black students at university. Mormons make up 1.7% of the population, and own \"10 times more Florida real estate than the Walt Disney company\". In 2008, according to the authors, the Church of England had assets of about $6.9bn (£4.2bn). Even 10 years earlier, the Mormon church was worth four times that.</p><p>The Mormons are not immigrants, but, Chua and Rubenfeld argue, they&nbsp;have the same combination of internalised superiority that comes from believing themselves \"chosen\", rigorous self-denial, and a social ambition motivated by being outside the mainstream that many immigrants&nbsp;share. The result is mainly visible on Wall Street: the chief executives or CFOs of Marriott, American Express, Citigroup, Deloitte, Sears and Roebuck and a handful of other corporations are all Mormons, who, the authors speculate, are sensitive to scepticism regarding their religion and motivated by a need to prove themselves. </p><p>All of which sounds reasonable, as does the fact that, within three generations, this upward mobility more or&nbsp;less burns out. \"Assimilation and success weaken the insecurities and other cultural forces that drove the first and second generation to rise.\" \"America,\" the authors write, \"is the great wrecker of impulse control.\" One&nbsp;example: \"from 1950 to 1990, Jewish high schoolers made up roughly 20% of the finalists in the prestigious, nationwide <a href=\"https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-sts\" title=\"\">Intel Science Talent Search</a>; since 2010, only 7%.\" And there are many more.</p><p>The fact that Chua and Rubenfeld belong to two of the eight groups focused on gives them licence to make the sort of statements other authors would shy away from, such as: \"Asians are now so overrepresented at Ivy League schools that they are being called the 'new Jews'.\" They do this with an amused eye on the fainting fit they know it will cause, and they are appropriately dismissive of lazy notions of causation. The Chinese, they write, are not successful because, as is&nbsp;often stated, they come from an \"education culture\" – the corollary of which is that less successful groups come from \"indolent cultures\" – but due to more wide-ranging contextual factors, among them the fact that \"Chinese kids are typically raised on a&nbsp;diet of stories about how Chinese civilisation is the oldest and most magnificent in world history.\"</p><p>The main problem is that in trying to give the book enough window-dressing to encourage sales, the authors veer from academic rigour to lightweight anecdotal evidence in a&nbsp;way that squanders much of their authority. News events, from the financial collapse to David Blaine standing on a plinth, are shoved through the sausage machine of the <em>Triple Package</em> argument, resulting in lame-sounding suggestions such as disgraced financier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff\" title=\"\">Bernie Madoff</a> exemplifying the \"triple package disease\" of \"insatiable need\". Or perhaps he is merely a narcissist. Who&nbsp;knows?</p><p>I would hesitate to rest assumptions, as they do, about Jewish identity on Greg Bellow's cross memoir of his father, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/25/saul-bellows-heart-greg-review\" title=\"\"><em>Saul Bellow's Heart</em></a>, which seems complicated by a million other factors. And quoting the remarks of \"one 23-year old Indian American professional\" talking about ethnic anxiety in a chatroom looks like the fruit of a Google search. As with so many books about ideas, this is indicative of the fact that <em>The Triple Package</em> could have covered the same ground in half the number of pages.</p><p>But there is still a lot to find interesting. The Amish have extraordinary \"impulse control\", but no interest in conventional success. \"The titled nobility of Victorian England had plenty of superiority but were not famously hard-working.\" It would have been entertaining to see the authors tackle the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2013/dec/12/scientology-recognition-supreme-court-wedding-uk\" title=\"\">Scientologists</a>, given their wealth, prominence and superiority complex – rooted in a belief in their magical powers.</p><p>They draw on eye-opening studies of the influence of stereotypes and expectations on various ethnic and cultural groups. (White people who were told playing mini-golf was a test of \"sports intelligence\" did better than when they were told it measured \"natural athletic ability\".) Above all, the authors' willingness to pursue an intellectual inquiry that others wouldn't is bracing. The conclusion is countercultural in the best sense, arguing, rather sensibly, for a correction to the modern culture of instant gratification and making a broad point about America mollycoddling its children.</p><p>It also reaffirms something we intuitively know – that origin stories matter, and that, despite the vast influence of external factors, the story you are permitted to tell about yourself has a lot to do with how that story unfolds.</p>","headline":"The Triple Package: What Really Determines Success – review","trailText":"<p>This book has stirred up a storm of controversy, writes <strong>Emma Brockes</strong>.

from a Salvation Army home for boys in Queensland reached unprecedented levels at a time a child prostitution ring was believed to be operating in the area, an inquiry into child sexual abuse has been told.</span><br></p><p>In 1973, 12 boys ran away 30 or 40 times from Alkira – a home for boys at Indooroopilly run by the Salvation Army – and in 1975, in particular, a boy would run away for a few days and then return, the inquiry was told.</p><p>In 1975, government authorities were made aware police were investigating allegations that four paedophiles were operating in the northern Brisbane suburbs and the Gold Coast in the early 1970s.</p><p>Jan Doyle, a senior social worker for the Queensland Department of Children's Services in the 1970s, told the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse the number of runaways was exceptional in 1973.</p><p>She also said that in 1975 she was deeply concerned about the whereabouts of one boy, HT, who frequently ran away from Alkira, so she spoke to the police Juvenile Aid Bureau which expressed concern about the paedophile ring and boys being taken to Sydney.</p><p>Doyle said she sought permission to run an advertisement with a photograph of HT requesting information about his whereabouts and that she remembered talking to welfare departments in New South Wales and Victoria about him.</p><p>Simeon Beckett, counsel advising the commission, asked her if any additional resources were allocated by the department to the Salvation Army home to ensure boys were protected from the prostitution racket.</p><p>\"Not that I am aware of,\" Doyle said.</p><p>But in 1973 the number of times children absconded was unusually high, she told the royal commission hearing in Sydney on Thursday.</p><p>Her evidence follows that of Salvation Army whistleblower retired major Clifford Randall, who told the hearing on Tuesday that in 1975 particularly the home was in a situation where boys were disappearing for more than a few days.</p><p>Former Queensland assistant police commissioner David Jefferies – who was with the Juvenile Aid Bureau in the 1970s – on Wednesday told the hearing it had received information that a Queensland millionaire, known as JA, was flying boys to Sydney to be abused as part of a paedophile ring.</p><p>\"This JA was certainly known as a millionaire and had, I believe, a construction business, and we certainly had received information about children actually going to his home,\" Jefferies said.</p><p>\"We were aware that boys in state care and from some institutions had in fact been flown to Sydney.\"</p><p>The hearing continues.</p>","headline":"Spate of runaways from boys'  home as police pursued paedophile ring:

The latest audit of the organisation also raised concerns about the recruitment of suitable staff, breaking ballot box seals without witnesses and ballot papers reconciliation.</p><p>\"There are signs their systems and procedures did need tightening up, clearly,\" McPhee said.</p><p>Rogers said measures had been taken to improve training methods and tighten security around ballot boxes following a major incident in 2010 in the electorates of Boothby and Flynn, where votes could not be included in the final count.</p><p>These measures included warnings, wire seals and the removal of all wire cutters. But Rogers admitted that in the 2013 election boxes were still opened without permission.</p><p>“Boothby and Flynn was a dramatic incident,” Rogers said. “We have taken a number of steps and have put in place a change in processes but it doesn’t mean the steps will prevent the re-occurrence.</p><p>“At the last election there was still unauthorised opening of ballot boxes by polling staff in spite of all of those measures put in place.”</p><p>The Liberal MP and chair Tony Smith told Rogers that in spite of a number of recommendations to the AEC over the years, including after the Boothby and Flynn incident, it remained unclear whether the commission could improve.</p><p>“There has been alarm bells ringing. In Boothby and Flynn you dodged a bullet because they were not close seats,” Smith said.</p><p>“You can understand the public concern and the committee’s concern about the capacity and capability of the the AEC to do what it now says it will do.”</p><p>Both the electoral commissioner, Ed Killesteyn, and Rogers have apologised on behalf of the organisation and have put in place new processes to track and secure ballot papers in the Griffith byelection on Saturday. </p>","headline":"WA Senate vote: electoral commission accused of repeating failures","trailText":"Unauthorised opening of ballot boxes by polling staff still happening, three years after scare in 2010 election","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg2z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674593291/b857f08a-f950-4155-9c91-97a4dea5b1ad-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674593291/b857f08a-f950-4155-9c91-97a4dea5b1ad-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"401","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429037664","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f3439be4b0530e249db065","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Gabrielle Chan","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039091","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T19:30:29+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/wa-senate-vote-electoral-commission-accused-repeating-failures","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/wa-senate-vote-electoral-commission-accused-repeating-failures","tags":[{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/western-australia","webTitle":"Western Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/western-australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/western-australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gabrielle-chan","webTitle":"Gabrielle Chan","r2ContributorId":"58017","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/7/1375846887937/Gabrielle-Chan.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Gabrielle Chan has been a journalist for 30 years.

full-frontal attack” according to Labor’s environment spokesman Mark Butler.</p><p>The Coalition went to the election promising to keep the renewable energy target (RET), which underpins investment in energy sources such as wind and solar.</p><p>But the prime minister has now taken control of a scheduled review in his own department and says the RET may have outlived its initial purpose and needs to be reassessed because it increases power prices.</p><p>“The Liberals went to the election saying there was no difference between the parties on renewable energy, but they weren’t being straight with the Australian people because now they are launching a full-frontal attack,” Butler said.</p><p>Butler said Labor would stick with its opposition to the repeal of the carbon tax when parliament resumes this month, but was now also preparing “to ramp up a community campaign in support of renewable energy”.</p><p>“We didn’t foresee this battle and it seems the responsible ministers [environment minister] Greg Hunt and [industry minister] Ian Macfarlane aren’t having much of a say either – it’s ideological and driven by people like [the prime minister’s chief business adviser] Maurice Newman.”</p><p>The renewable energy industry is also becoming increasingly alarmed at signals the government intends to drastically reduce, or even abolish, the target.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/05/solar-industry-to-launch-marginal-seats-campaign-to-save-renewables-target\">Australian solar council has launched a “save solar” campaign</a> because of deep concerns the review will cripple the industry by axing the target, which requires 45,000 gigawatt hours of power to be sourced from renewables by 2020 and provides a subsidy to people installing solar systems.</p><p>In opposition, the Coalition was highly supportive of the solar industry and critical of constant changes to government incentives.</p><p>The environment minister, Greg Hunt, <a href=\"http://greghunt.com.au/Media/OpinionPieces/tabid/88/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/902/Blog--Skydiving-for-a-Solar-Future.aspx\">jumped out of a plane</a> to support a previous “save our solar” campaign on the grounds that Labor’s decision to means-test the then $8,000 subsidy was putting the industry into “freefall”.</p><p>And both Hunt and Macfarlane have said the Coalition would keep its election promise to retain an effective RET.</p><p>Details of the review are expected by the end of the month, with the government struggling to get around the legislative requirement that it be undertaken by the climate change authority, which it intends to abolish but has not yet been able to.</p><p>Before Christmas, the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/18/renewable-energy-tony-abbott-signals-he-could-wind-back-or-scrap-targets\">said the RET may have outlived its usefulness and become a burden on business</a> and on Thursday repeated his concerns in response to the announcement that Queensland government-owned Stanwell was mothballing its gas-fired Swanbank E power station in October.</p><p>The decision was driven by the fact that rising gas export prices mean it has become more lucrative to sell the gas than use it to generate electricity, but the company has also complained about the RET in a submission to the government’s energy review.<br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Tony Abbott said last year: “We support sensible use of renewable energy, and as you know it was [the] former Howard government which initially gave us the RET and at the time it was important because we made very little use of renewable energy.</span><br></p><p>“But we have to accept that in the changed circumstances of today, the renewable energy target is causing pretty significant price pressure in the system and we ought to be an affordable energy superpower … cheap energy ought to be one of our comparative advantages.”</p><p>His chief business adviser, Maurice Newman,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/12/abbott-business-adviser-renewables-target\"> has called for</a> the renewable energy target to be scrapped and several Coalition backbenchers are also pushing for it to be axed.</p><p>Hunt has canvassed compromise options with industry, including changing the existing target that 20% of energy come from renewable sources by 2020, to one requiring 25% from renewable sources by 2025. The plan would overcome the effect of falling electricity demand on the real impact of the RET.</p><p>Modelling released last week suggested abolishing the RET could cost 2,000 jobs in the solar panel industry.</p><p>According to the Australian Energy Market Commission, the RET has increased retail electricity prices by 3.5%.</p>","headline":"Tony Abbott ‘launching a full-frontal attack’ on

The international community has long ago reached a verdict about it,\" the ministry said. </p><p>\"A handful of people in Japan have tried to blot out, cover up and distort that history,\" it said. \"Such behaviour is in the same line as those of some Japanese leaders who try to reverse history. The international community should be highly vigilant at this.\" </p><p>China's ties with Japan have long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo's failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during the second world war. </p><p>Deteriorating relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been fuelled by a row over a chain of disputed islands in the East China Sea. Ships from both countries frequently shadow each other around the islets, raising fears of a clash. </p><p>Ties have further worsened since China's creation of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the controversial Yasukuni shrine honouring war criminals among Japan's war dead. <br></p>","headline":"China fury at Japanese claim that Nanjing massacre never took place","trailText":"Board member at Japan's state broadcaster denies infamous slaughter in 1937 of at least 140,000 people did not happen<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg2x","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664443307/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664443307/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"339","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429030560","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f319f0e4b0ab978b0f9749","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039068","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T16:45:27+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/china-japanese-nanjing-massacre-never-took-place","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/06/china-japanese-nanjing-massacre-never-took-place","tags":[{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/china","references":[]},{"id":"world/japan","webTitle":"Japan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/japan","references":[]},{"id":"world/senkaku-islands","webTitle":"Senkaku Islands","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/senkaku-islands","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-4931ed6a-ad99-459c-b04b-2867c160bb57","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664442466/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391664442466/1240f97f-52c4-4234-8b3d-ef711df356cd-220x132.jpeg","source":"  Bettmann/CORBIS","altText":"Japanese forces close in on Nanjing in 1937.

to the ground on Oxford Street in March 2013 and later charged with resisting and assaulting officers and using offensive language in public.</p><p>All charges have been withdrawn and the magistrate, Michael Barko, on Thursday dismissed the case against Jackson Reed, awarding him $39,000 in costs.</p><p>\"He is quiet, but will next be seen on a float at the Mardi Gras,\" the 19-year-old's lawyer, Chris Murphy, said.</p><p>The arresting officer, Constable Leon Mixios, had told the Downing Centre local court he arrested Jackson Reed after seeing him kick a woman.</p><p>But she has not been seen since and Jackson Reed was never charged with assaulting her, his hearing was told.</p><p>The arrest of the then 18-year-old from the southern suburb of Jannali sparked community outrage and an internal police investigation after video footage taken by onlookers showed Mixios slamming him to the ground.</p><p>In footage of the viral video played in court, a tearful Jackson Reed repeatedly yelled: \"What's his name, I didn't do anything wrong\", as Mixios grabbed his neck and another officer told members of the crowd to stop filming.</p><p>A notebook entry apparently handwritten by Mixios after the arrest details how he held the bleeding teenager down with his foot.</p><p>\"I have pulled him back and thrown him to ground with a leg sweep,\" the entry read. \"I placed my foot on his back to hold him down as he was bleeding and I didn't want to be contaminated nor did I feel safe getting down with the crowd around us.\"</p><p>Later, according to the entry, \"POI [the person of

skeletal remains of elderly Sydney woman</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-06T09:00:41.405Z","body":"<p>Natalie Wood, who lay dead inside her house for eight years, fell out with her family after they refused to take her in when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, an inquest has concluded.<br></p><p>Police found the skeletal remains of the elderly Sydney woman in July 2011 in the upstairs bedroom of her Surry Hills home, only metres away from Central station.</p><p>In his findings into her death, the state coroner, Michael Barnes, said her sister-in-law, Enid Davis, was mistaken when she told police she had last seen Wood in January 2003, when she had apparently learned of Wood's brain tumour.</p><p>\"Ms Wood had not been diagnosed with the brain tumour she told her sister-in-law of until November 2003,\" Barnes said.</p><p>\"In my view it is likely that Ms Wood was aggrieved that her brother and sister-in-law had not agreed to her being discharged to their place when the hospital inquired about this possibility.</p><p>\"She was also disappointed that for the first time they did not share Christmas with her that year.</p><p>\"Although Ms Davis denies it, I expect Ms Wood expressed her disappointment to them when she saw them soon after Christmas 2003,” he said.</p><p>\"I suspect she did it in such a manner that when she then ceased all further contact, they were not surprised and did not assume anything untoward had become of her.\"</p><p>Barnes said Wood had died on an unknown date in February 2004 after possibly falling in her home and not being able to summon help.</p><p>However, he concluded the cause and manner of her death was not ascertainable.</p><p>Barnes dismissed the evidence of a neighbour who this week told police he had seen a middle-aged woman looking out of the window of the house during the eight years that Wood was thought to have been lying dead inside.</p><p>Ashley Russell Blower, who moved to Kippax Street in 2005,

specimen of a new species of jellyfish has washed up on a beach in Tasmania, shocking the local family who found it and exciting scientists.</p><p>Stretching 1.5m wide, the unnamed species of lion’s mane jellyfish was found on a beach at Howden south of Hobart by the Lim family last month. </p><p>Lisa-ann Gershwin, research scientist with CSIRO’s wealth from oceans flagship, told Guardian Australia it was among the biggest she’s ever seen in her career studying jellyfish.</p><p>“There is a bigger species in the Arctic, and it gets about 3m across the body, so there are biggers species out there, but not in Australia,” she said.</p><p>The species itself is one of three new species of lion’s mane in Tasmania and Gershwin is now working to properly name and classify them.</p><p>“It’s not new because it’s large,” she said of this latest creature.</p><p>“It’s new because its structural features are unlike other species, it just so happens that this one is huge … it’s the size of a Smart car.”</p><p>The discovery comes amid a recent increase in jellyfish in Tasmanian waters and around the world, but scientists don’t know what’s behind it – although they have suspicions.</p><p>“We’re actually seeing a lot of jellyfish blooming this year. It’s been a big year for gelatinous creatures of all sorts,” said Gershwin.</p><p>“It is pretty warm this year. A lot of the sorts of things that are happening around the world <b>–</b> not just climate change but also ocean acidification, eutrophication, introduced species, pollution, overfishing  <b>– </b>they’re all impacting the whole world and we’re not immune here in Australia. It’s not like we’re on a different planet.</p><p>“The bigger take home part of this is … what effect all of those mouths are having on the ecosystem and in turn what effect that has on our way of life,” she said.</p><p>“Southern Australia is known for some of the best fisheries on the planet but what’s happening when those fish we’re relying on are competing for food with the jellyfish?”</p><p>Aside from the scientific curiosity, Gershwin said it was great the discovery was made by 12-year-old Xavier Lim, who she described as “chuffed” at the find.</p><p>\"We were at the beach looking for shells and dad was like 'Whoa! Look at that' … I kind of touched it ... it was pretty cool,\" Lim told ABC.</p><p>Gershwin and her colleagues are looking into setting up long-term research projects to investigate the sudden proliferation of jellyfish.</p>","headline":"Unidentified giant jellyfish species washes up on Tasmanian beach","trailText":"Discovery of the 1.5m-wide gelatinous creature the size of a Smart car coincides with a global jellyfish bloom ","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg2h","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391671564750/9bd4bfa0-e235-4b06-8446-30dec4523fe0-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391671564750/9bd4bfa0-e235-4b06-8446-30dec4523fe0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"403","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429034876","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f337f3e4b0530e249db059","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Davidson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039084","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T07:50:49Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/06/unidentified-giant-jellyfish-species-tasmania","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/06/unidentified-giant-jellyfish-species-tasmania","tags":[{"id":"environment/marine-life","webTitle":"Marine life","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/marine-life","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/tasmania","webTitle":"Tasmania","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tasmania","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/tasmania","references":[]},{"id":"environment/oceans","webTitle":"Oceans","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/oceans","references":[]},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-change","references":[]},{"id":"science/scienceofclimatechange","webTitle":"Climate change","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/science/scienceofclimatechange","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helen-davidson","webTitle":"Helen Davidson","r2ContributorId":"56484","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369271907292/Helen-Davidson(1).jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Davidson is a reporter for Guardian Australia.

Safety rules for trials meant the electrodes had to be removed from Sorensen's arm after a month but scientists think they would have continued to function without harm for several years.</p><p>They said the hand had allowed him to experience \"almost natural\" sensory feelings comparable to those he felt in his remaining hand. He had distinguished hard, medium and soft objects and recognised basic shapes such as the cylinder of a bottle and the sphere of a baseball.</p><p>The team plan to do further trials with more patients, saying these could open up the chances of far more dexterous artificial hands, even though it could be years for the equipment to be miniaturised and available for everyday use. Since his accident, Sorensen had been wearing a conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his arm, allowing him to open and close the hand but he was unable to feel objects he had grasped. \"I was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well,\" he said.</p><p>Alastair Ritchie, a lecturer in biomaterials and bioengineering at Nottingham University, welcomed the \"very interesting work\" taking research on upper-limb prosthetics \"into the next stage\".</p><p>\"Our hands are one of our principal interfaces with the world, and in recent years we have seen real advances. This technology would enable the user to know how firmly they are gripping an object, which is vital for handling fragile objects – imagine picking up an egg without any feeling in your fingers. Another exciting aspect is the ability of the human brain to learn, allowing the user to become more proficient as he gains experience in using the prosthesis.\"</p><p>However, rigorous wound care would be needed to prevent infection, including from electrodes embedded next to the peripheral nerves and wires running through the skin.</p><p>David Gow, director of rehabilitation engineering services and bioengineering at NHS Lothian, said: \"Although based on a single case study, the results look like a practical surgical-based method of delivering spatial and force information from a robotic hand's sensors back to the user to allow him fine control of force and to gain some knowledge of the shape and stiffness of the object in his artificial grasp.</p><p>\"This opens up exciting possibilities for artificial-limb users and takes us a step closer to a clinically viable man-machine interface.\"</p>","headline":"Man gets bionic hand with sense of touch nine years after

director, Mark Scott, has refused Tony Abbott’s calls for the national broadcaster to apologise for its handling of allegations made by asylum seekers against the Australian navy.<br></p><p>Facing continued fire from the Coalition government and criticism from <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3937354.htm\">the ABC’s Media Watch</a>, Scott defended his stance and <a href=\"http://about.abc.net.au/press-releases/abc-statement/\">his recent statement making no apologies but acknowledging the reporting could have been more precise</a>.<br></p><p>“If there is imprecise wording … and anyone interpreted that that the ABC had been judge and jury on this, we certainly don’t want that to be the case,” said Scott.<br></p><p>\"We never sought to be judge and jury on this matter. We do not know what went on on that boat.”<br></p><p>Scott said throughout the ABC’s history, there had been stories that “people disagree with” but that it was “par for the course” for media organisations and insisted he was “standing firm” in his role.<br></p><p>“There is some suggestion here that those allegations shouldn’t have been reported. There’s some suggestion here that that video tape should not have been aired,” Scott said.<br></p><p>“We stand by the thrust of the story and I think it’s important that we be judged on that story,” he said.<br></p><p>\"We know that the coverage of<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23asylumseekers&amp;src=hash\"> </a>asylum seekers has been contentious.\"<br></p><p>Abbott and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/abc-should-have-been-more-sceptical-malcolm-turnbull\">communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull</a>, with responsibility for the ABC, have been critical of the ABC’s coverage of a story that detailed allegations that asylum seekers had suffered burns when navy personnel made them hold on to hot engine pipes as boats were turned back to Indonesia.<br></p><p>Scott made reference to criticism of the ABC by a number of columnists who were “leading the charge” against the national broadcaster and suggested \"some of that is ideological and some of it is commercial”.<br></p><p>The government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/05/australia-network-overtaken-by-technology-malcolm-turnbull\">reviewing the 10-year $223m Australia Network contract</a>, which was awarded to the ABC by the former Labor government after intense and controversial competition with Sky News. The auditor general subsequently criticised the tender process.<br></p><p>Scott said there would always be critics but it was his belief, backed by all of the research seen by the ABC, that the broadcaster operated \"with the strong support of the Australian people\".<br></p><p>Scott took talkback calls after his interview with the ABC's Jon Faine, with some callers highly supportive of the broadcaster, some critical and one angry that the ABC's reporting did not demonstrate \"a love of Australia\".<br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">On Wednesday, </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/05/tony-abbott-sorry-seems-to-be-the-hardest-word-for-the-abc\" style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">the prime minister suggested that “sorry seems to be the hardest word”</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> for the ABC and expressed his disappointment at the coverage of the navy.</span><br></p>","headline":"ABC chief Mark Scott refuses Tony Abbott's call for apology to navy","trailText":"Broadcaster defends its handling of burns allegations by asylum seekers, saying 'we never sought to be judge and jury'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgxv","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391651812048/98253aa4-55d5-486b-a25c-fd51c1f2d887-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391651812048/98253aa4-55d5-486b-a25c-fd51c1f2d887-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"415","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429024336","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2e8ffe4b0530e249db02e","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Gabrielle Chan and Lenore Taylor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039040","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:00:23+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/06/abc-mark-scott-refuses-apology-navy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/2014/feb/06/abc-mark-scott-refuses-apology-navy","tags":[{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"world/tony-abbott","webTitle":"Tony Abbott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/tony-abbott","references":[]},{"id":"world/malcolm-turnbull","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malcolm-turnbull","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/malcolm-turnbull","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-immigration-and-asylum","webTitle":"Australian immigration and asylum","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-immigration-and-asylum","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-immigration-and-asylum","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-military","webTitle":"Australian military","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-military","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-military","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp;

Records concerning past cases should be opened up so that they can be used to hold the abusers – and those who may have sought to protect them – accountable, the panel added.</p><p>The Holy See must establish \"clear rules, mechanisms and procedures\" for the mandatory reporting of all suspected cases of abuse to civil law enforcement authorities, it said.</p><p>The committee said it was \"particularly concerned\" that in dealing with allegations of child sex abuse, \"the Holy See has consistently placed the preservation of the reputation of the church and the protection of the perpetrators above children's best interests, as observed by several national commissions of inquiry.\"</p><p>The Vatican responded testily to the findings, saying that though it would submit them \"to a thorough study and examination\", it regretted what it perceived to be interference in its affairs. The statement was thought to refer to the committee's remarks on contraception and abortion.</p><p>\"The Holy See does … regret to see in some points of the concluding observations an attempt to interfere with Catholic church teaching on the dignity of human person and in the exercise of religious freedom,\" said a Vatican statement.</p><p>\"The Holy See reiterates its commitment to defending and protecting the rights of the child, in line with the principles promoted by the convention on the rights of the child and according to the moral and religious values offered by Catholic doctrine.\"</p><p></p><p>But the report, the recommendations of which are entirely non-binding, was welcomed by those who have long found the Vatican's approach to the scandal wanting.</p><p>\"This day has been a long time coming, but the international community is finally holding the Vatican accountable for its role in enabling and perpetuating sexual violence in the church,\" said Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"The whole world will be watching to ensure that the Vatican takes the concrete steps required by the UN to protect children and end these crimes. Impunity and cover-up, including at the highest levels of the church, will not be tolerated.\"</p><p>Barbara Blaine, president of the US-based Survivors Network of those Abused (Snap), described the report as a \"scathing\" indictment of the way the Vatican had handled the scandal.</p><p>\"It's a wake-up call, not to Catholic officials (who have known about and concealed abuse for decades and still do) but for secular officials, especially those in law enforcement, who can and should investigate Catholic abuses and cover-ups and prosecute the church supervisors who are still protecting predators and endangering children,\" she said.</p><p>As part of its wide-ranging remit, the UN committee also expressed concern about how the Holy See's stance on contraception, abortion and homosexuality was affecting minors.</p><p>It also said the Vatican needed to launch a full investigation into Ireland's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/19/ireland-apologises-slave-labour-magdalene-laundries\" title=\"\">Magdalene Laundries scandal</a> in which thousands of women and girls were abused and enslaved. The report said those who abused and exploited those incarcerated in the laundries run by Irish nuns should be prosecuted if they are still alive.</p><p>It urged that \"full compensation be paid to the victims and their families\" who were caught up in the Magdalene system in Ireland.</p><p>While welcoming statements made by the Holy See delegation expressing a commitment to upholding the rights of children, the committee made clear its \"deepest concern\" about abuse committed by clergy operating \"under the authority of the Holy See\".</p><p>Tens of thousands of children had been abused by clerics worldwide, it said.</p><p>\"The committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators,\" it wrote.</p><p>The report came two weeks after the committee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/un-criticises-vatican-coverups-child-sex-abuse-catholic-priests\" title=\"\">grilled a Vatican delegation</a> over the church's response to abuse allegations.</p><p>In particular, the committee slammed the practice of moving priests found to have abused children from parish to parish or to other countries \"in an attempt to cover up such crimes\". Last month a Vatican delegation in Geneva for questioning by the panel accepted criticisms of this practice and said it no longer went on.</p><p>But the committee nonetheless noted: \"The practice of offenders' mobility, which has allowed many priests to remain in contact with children and to continue to abuse them, still places children in many countries at high risk of sexual abuse, as dozens of child sexual offenders are reported to be still in contact with children.\"</p><p>The UN panel also criticised the Holy See for refusing to hand over data concerning all cases of abuse brought to its attention during the period in question, and their outcomes. It said that confidential disciplinary proceedings had \"allowed the vast majority of abusers and almost all those who concealed child sexual abuse to escape judicial proceedings in states where abuses were committed\".</p><p>It also said the reporting of suspected crimes had been strongly hampered by a \"code of silence\" among the clergy which had seen those who dared to break it \"ostracised, demoted and fired\", and cited one well-known instance from 2001 in which a bishop was in effect congratulated for having kept to it.</p><p>Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society in Britain, said Francis was now under pressure to prove his determination to take action.</p><p>\"Pope Francis has already missed opportunities to assert his authority to reverse the church's damaging policies over clerical abuse and unless he responds positively and quickly to the demands of the committee, he risks history judging his whole papacy a failure,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>\"Lawyers confirm that evidence abounds of the church at all levels continuing, even following the resignation of Pope Benedict, to do everything in its power to shield abusing Catholic clerics from justice and maintain secrecy, and do the least possible for victims,\" he said.</p><p>The Vatican was expected to issue a statement on the findings later on Wednesday.</p>","headline":"UN denounces Vatican over child abuse and demands immediate action","trailText":"Devastating UN report demands Vatican 'immediately remove' all clergy who are known or

What the conservatives want is baddies and what they think is, unions are baddies. </p><p>“The proposition that we have consensus is a good proposition but the proposition that Tony Abbott’s capable of sitting down with unions? How can you sit down and investigate consensus with organisations Tony Abbott wants to investigate?”</p><p>Shorten’s remarks followed a National Press Club speech by Howes – who Shorten described as his “protege” – calling on business and unions to work together on a “grand compact”, a long-term industrial relations system that did not face an overhaul each time the government changed.</p><p>“A bitter all-out war between labour and capital will not end with productivity gains,” Howes said on Wednesday.</p><p>Abbott characterised Howes’s speech as a direct attack on Shorten and said the concept of a grand compact was “very 1980s”.<br></p><p>“I certainly think he’s pulled the rug out from underneath Bill Shorten’s scare campaign. That was a very powerful assault on everything Bill Shorten has been doing for the past few months,\" he said.<br></p><p>Abbott again alluded to a royal commission into unions.<br></p><p>“What we said pre-election was there would be a judicial inquiry into union slush funds. We have had further revelations about more widespread corruption. We are committed to a judicial inquiry into union slush funds, whether it should have a broader remit, we are looking at that,” he said.<br></p><p>While campaigning for Bill Glasson in Kevin Rudd’s former Brisbane seat of Griffith, Abbott said there was “much good” in Howes’s speech.<br></p><p>“That said, I think that what we need to see is managers and workers in partnership at the workplace. That’s what we need to see,” he said.</p><p>Abbott said strong and profitable businesses required committed, determined and  enthusiastic workers.</p><p>“We need to see a very high level of personal engagement between workers and managers at every individual business. What I don’t particularly want to see is some kind of big government, big business, big unions council which somehow dictates to everyone,” he said.</p><p>“We all know that’s not democracy, that’s corporatism.”</p><p>Abbott said he supported “grassroots partnerships”.</p><p>Glasson was also asked about the speech and described it as “sensible and sound”. </p><p>Shorten, a former head of the Australian Workers’ Union, said he had always been a man of the middle ground when it came to industrial relations and politics but he did not think the Abbott government was interested in anything other than attacking unions and employees.</p><p>When Shorten was asked if his remark was an example of the sort of “overreach” Howes said both sides in industrial relations debates were guilty of, he replied: “I can’t seriously sit here in this interview and say to you I think there is a remote chance of Tony Abbott and his hardline rightwing government are interested in co-operation. </p><p>“How can you sit down and form an accord with a series of organisations that you want to have a royal commission into? It’s not real.”</p><p>As well as referencing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/tony-abbott-union-inquiry-royal-commission-corruption\">potential royal commission into unions</a> Abbott has flagged, Shorten said the government’s rhetoric about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/spc-ardmona-says-abbott-wrong\">workers at SPC Ardmona</a> was also proof it was not interested in sitting down with unions and employees.</p><p>When asked if Howes had undermined Shorten with the speech, the opposition leader replied he believed union leaders were entitled to their opinion before adding: “That’s not Tony Abbott’s Australia.”</p><p>Howes stopped short of endorsing a royal commission into unions but said every time the Coalition was in power, business saw it as an opportunity to change laws, and unions thought the same thing whenever Labor won government.</p><p>“Some will tell you that our industrial relations system is dragging us down, and I won’t be popular amongst my friends in the labour movement for saying this, but I agree. However, I don’t want to call the lawyers in so they can start pulling apart the legislation,” he said.<br></p><p>Howes said the key to productivity and competitiveness was not another Howard-style WorkChoices or indeed another Rudd/Gillard-style Fair Work Act, but to step back and recognise the concerning “seesaw pattern of industrial relations in this country”.</p>","headline":"Paul Howes call for industrial consensus is 'fantasy', says Bill Shorten","trailText":"'How can you sit down and form an accord with a series of organisations that you want to have a royal commission into?

Among the 26 marine areas studied in Australia, the only place with all five key traits was Middle Reef, near Lord Howe Island.</p><p>The six-year study, which utilised scientists and divers from 19 countries, concluded that while the number of marine protected areas was increasing rapidly, the benefits generated were “difficult to predict and under debate”.</p><p>“MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve,” the paper states.</p><p>“Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimise protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.”</p><p>Prof Graham Edgar, lead author of the report at the University of Tasmania’s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, said that poor quality marine parks needed to be “retrofitted” to ensure they properly protected underwater life.</p><p>“Given the huge changes now occurring out of sight under water, and our poor knowledge of exactly what is happening and how best to deal with the various threats individually, the need for protected areas that safeguard whole communities of marine species has never been greater,” he said.</p><p>“What we do know is that numbers of many Australian marine species have collapsed since European settlement, including some that have disappeared.</p><p>“At present, coastal zoning maps are confusing, with the few conservation gems hidden amongst protected areas that are ineffective because of inadequate regulations or poor enforcement.”</p><p>In December, the Coalition government tore up management plans drawn up by Labor to create the world’s largest network marine parks off Australia’s coast.</p><p>Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said the plans would have “locked out” recreational fishers from Australian waters. While the marine park boundaries would remain, new management plans would be created, dismaying environmental campaigners who pointed out that most non-fishing areas were more than 50km from population centres.</p><p>The Great Barrier Reef marine park, possibly the most famous marine park in the world, is set to become the dumping site for 3m cubic metres of dredged seabed after a permit for the controversial disposal was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/31/great-barrier-reef-dredging-spoil-dumping-approved-abbot-point\">issued last week</a>.</p>","headline":"Most protected marine areas fail to properly guard aquatic life: study","trailText":"Research shows 59% of the world's marine parks  were 'not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgx8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391653223186/cddbf7ab-2aaa-4559-b043-974e6cff6827-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391653223186/cddbf7ab-2aaa-4559-b043-974e6cff6827-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"503","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429025992","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2f112e4b0530e249db032","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Oliver Milman","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039048","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:45:00+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/06/protected-areas-fail-aquatic-life","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/06/protected-areas-fail-aquatic-life","tags":[{"id":"environment/marine-life","webTitle":"Marine life","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/marine-life","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"environment/fishing","webTitle":"Fishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fishing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/fishing","references":[]},{"id":"environment/endangered-habitats","webTitle":"Endangered habitats","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangered-habitats","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/endangered-habitats","references":[]},{"id":"environment/endangeredspecies","webTitle":"Endangered species","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangeredspecies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/endangeredspecies","references":[]},{"id":"environment/great-barrier-reef","webTitle":"Great Barrier Reef","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/great-barrier-reef","references":[]},{"id":"world/greg-hunt","webTitle":"Greg Hunt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greg-hunt","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/greg-hunt","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/oliver-milman","webTitle":"Oliver Milman","rcsId":"Oliver Mi","r2ContributorId":"47089","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/24/1369407668675/Oliver-Milman.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Oliver Milman is a reporter at Guardian Australia, focused on environmental issues.

The reforms aimed to simplify and streamline regulations in order to facilitate higher productivity and better competition.</p><p>On Friday the <a href=\"https://www.coagreformcouncil.gov.au/\">Council of Australian Governments (Coag) reform council</a> released its final review of the performance of governments in achieving reforms across 45 areas. The reform council found that 31 of the 45 areas had achieved significant reforms.</p><p>Among the key achievements listed by the council were a national health practitioner registration and accreditation system, ensuring nationally consistent standards for a range of health professionals, and an Australian consumer law providing a single national set of consumer protections.</p><p>However, it concluded that “some important reforms remain to be done and need further attention from Coag”. Among the 11 areas which have achieved only partial completion are occupational health and safety regulation and a framework for governments to act to ensure the adequacy of energy market investment.</p><p>On occupational health and safety, the council noted that the reform measures which were designed to create nationally uniform OHS laws to reduce compliance costs for business and promote safer, healthier workplaces, have failed to have been addressed. It noted that Victoria and Western Australia have not enacted laws, while NSW, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT have laws which differ from the model national law.</p><p>Similarly, the council found that there is no nationally consistent mine safety regime as no government had enacted the national core mine safety laws and regulations.  </p><p>While some reforms were found to be partially completed, three reforms dealing with energy pricing and road regulation were designated to be “off track”. The aim of removing energy retail pricing, according to the council, is to allow retailers to set prices that reflect the true cost of energy supply. The council asserted this “sends signals to consumers to manage their energy consumption (otherwise known as active demand side participation)”. However, the council noted that over the past five years, only Victoria and South Australia have removed energy retail price regulation.</p><p>It noted that reviews to be conducted by the Australian Energy Market Commission were well behind schedule. The review of prices in NSW was only completed in 2013 – a year behind schedule – and the review of Queensland prices, which was due to be completed in 2013, has yet to be started. The Queensland state government has, however, pledged to remove electricity price regulation in southeast Queensland by 1 July, 2015.</p><p>The lack of progress on energy reform also fed into the council’s finding that progress on measures to establish “a simpler and consistent national approach to economic regulation of significant infrastructure” has only been partially completed. This reform is intended to ensure the consistent regulation of access to nationally significant infrastructure services, such as the electricity grid, rail networks and port facilities. It aims to “reduce the regulatory uncertainty and compliance costs” for owners, users and investors of nationally significant infrastructure.</p><p>The council found that while most state and federal infrastructure areas were compliant with the reforms, it noted the reform in all energy access regimes in national energy market jurisdictions, the Victorian rail access regime and the Western Australian gas access regime remained to be completed.</p><p>The council’s report also confirmed the findings of its “Lessons for Federal Reform” report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/coag-reform-activity-has-slowed-says-new-report\">released last November</a>, that progress on reform is significantly enhanced through reward payments. The council noted that “governments have made better progress implementing the reforms that attract reward payments than they have made on the reforms that do not attract reward payments”. It found that governments have completed 21 of 26 reforms in which rewards were offered and only 10 of 19 reforms where no reward was offered.</p><p>The chairman of the reform council, former Victorian premier John Brumby, in his letter to the prime minister, Tony Abbott presenting the report, recommended that in considering any future reforms, Coag should “take note that greater progress was made on reforms that attracted reward payments under this agreement than on those reforms that did not attract reward payments”.</p>","headline":"Coag reform review: still a way to go for a ‘seamless national economy’","trailText":"Review identifies significant reforms in 31 out of 45 areas, but a lack of progress on energy reform ","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfxy","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391565681659/9c37185c-8675-4bec-8b26-923b84e45313-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391565681659/9c37185c-8675-4bec-8b26-923b84e45313-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"720","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"428934968","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f19933e4b025fe0e2e663e","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Greg Jericho","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038332","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T20:15:16Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/feb/06/coag-reform-review-still-a-way-to-go-for-a-seamless-national-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/news/2014/feb/06/coag-reform-review-still-a-way-to-go-for-a-seamless-national-economy","tags":[{"id":"global/council-of-australian-governments","webTitle":"Council of Australian Governments","type":"keyword","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global/council-of-australian-governments","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/global/council-of-australian-governments","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia-economy","webTitle":"Australia economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia-economy","references":[]},{"id":"business/energy-industry","webTitle":"Energy industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/energy-industry","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/greg-jericho","webTitle":"Greg Jericho","r2ContributorId":"56591","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/22/1369191059253/Greg-Jericho2.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/greg-jericho","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/greg-jericho","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-f252c6c7-307d-4709-8fe1-df654474d70b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/12/1389543311528/electricity-pylons-012.jpg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/12/1389543311528/electricity-pylons-012.jpg","source":"PA","photographer":"Andrew Milligan","altText":"electricity pylons","height":"372","credit":"Andrew Milligan/PA","caption":"Some reforms dealing with energy pricing were designated 'off track': over the past five years, only Victoria and South Australia have removed energy retail price regulation.
