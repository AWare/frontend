By the turn of the 20th century, congested streets and fog meant that mail transported between the main Post Offices and railway stations in London was severely delayed. In February 1911 a departmental committee recommended construction of an electric railway with driverless trains to alleviate the problem. In 1913 the Post Office (London) Railway Act was passed, paving the way for a new railway – six and a half miles long, with tunnels an average of 20 metres (70ft) below ground. It would connect the West End and East End via eight stations.
