Appointed in the early 1950s as the Manchester Guardian’s first professional librarian, he later became BBC head of news information.</p> <p>Son of Reginald and Gertrude Whatmore, Geoffrey was born in Birmingham, where his father worked for the General Electric Company. He trained as a librarian during the late 1930s, and after second world war service returned to his profession at Birmingham Central Library. However, feeling “restless after years away”, he changed tack by becoming a librarian at the Nottingham Journal.</p> <p>Excited by the news business, in 1951 he successfully applied for the post of librarian at the Manchester Guardian, a paper he then held in awe. An ad hoc job interview with the editor AP Wadsworth over a glass of sherry and a “rather indifferent” lunch at the Manchester Reform Club was a good introduction to the ways of the paper. So too was the haggling over the salary.</p> <p>Geoffrey was to spend the next few years turning an archaic collection of press cuttings, index cards and random books into an effective newspaper reference service, providing valuable assistance during major events such as the Suez crisis. He even managed to persuade management to install a telephone in the library.</p> <p>Eventually, though, he found the paper “stuffy” and, keen to move to London, found a job running the British Institute of Management’s information department. Following this, he was appointed personal assistant to Cecil King, chairman of the Daily Mirror. Throughout much of the 1960s and during dramatic company takeovers, Geoffrey was at the newspaper baron’s side, writing many of his speeches.</p> <p>After King was removed by his directors, Geoffrey reverted to librarianship, becoming Daily Mirror librarian. He set about reorganising the paper’s vast cuttings collection but tense labour relations meant this was not the happiest of times. It was with some relief, then, that in 1973 he became head of news information at the BBC.</p> <p>Over the years, the BBC had fostered a whole tribe of intersecting libraries and it was one of Geoffrey’s jobs to bring some order to radio and TV reference services. The role was also the focus of intense library politics, but he was later to look back at this time at the BBC as the most rewarding of his working life.</p> <p>A fine writer, Geoffrey was the author of a number of books, including titles on news information and a guide to his adopted home of Pershore in Worcestershire. In a long retirement he ran his own antiquarian books business, specialising in angling, one of his favourite pastimes.</p> <p>Geoffrey is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Collis Walker), whom he married in 1950, two children, Adam and Sarah, two grandchildren, Heather and James, and a great-grandson.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fjtc","wordcount":"486","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ab5c203940b40060d8f342e37813cffba2d6bab8/0_0_873_524/140.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/08/geoffrey-whatmore-obituary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/jan/08/geoffrey-whatmore-obituary","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"ab5c203940b40060d8f342e37813cffba2d6bab8","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ab5c203940b40060d8f342e37813cffba2d6bab8/0_34_873_660/500.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/ab5c203940b40060d8f342e37813cffba2d6bab8","altText":"After

Dorit Rabinyan’s Gader Haya (Borderlife) off school reading lists","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>A love story between an Israeli Jew and a Palestinian Muslim has become an unlikely bestseller, after Israel’s education ministry refused to allow the book on the high school curriculum.</p> <p>Dorit Rabinyan’s Gader Haya, known in English as Borderlife, was left off courses last week to avoid encouraging relationships between Jews and Arabs, sparking a backlash by Israeli cultural figures and a buying frenzy.</p> <p>The e book has shot to the top of the fiction chart, becoming s a bestseller in bookstores and online.</p> <p>The country’s main chart does not provide numbers, but Rabinyan’s agent said more than 5,000 copies had been sold in a week, a huge figure in Israel’s small market, with many bookstores selling out.</p> <p>Deals to sell the rights in Hungary, Spain and Brazil had been discussed, while publication in the US, France and other countries, where translation deals had been agreed, would be sped up, the agent said.</p> <p>Reflecting on the controversy, Rabinyan said that while she was “worried” about the future of Israeli democracy, she had been encouraged by the support she received. </p> <p>“I think this whole march to bookstores is a demonstration,” she said. “It is not only my fans that buy Borderlife, it is the fans of Israeli democracy. By buying my novel they reconfirm their trust and belief in Israel’s liberalism, in Israel’s freedom of choice and speech.”</p> <p>Borderlife, published in 2014, is Rabinyan’s semi-autobiographical story of an Israeli woman who falls in love with a male Palestinian artist in New York. The two later part ways as she returns to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and he to Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p> <p>Relationships between Israeli Jews and Palestinians are rare and frowned on by large parts of both societies.</p> <p>The book was among the winners of the Bernstein prize for young writers, an annual Israeli award for Hebrew literature.</p> <p>After requests by teachers to add it to the curriculum, a committee initially backed the book, but was later overruled by senior ministry officials. Among the reasons given was that “intimate relations between Jews and non-Jews threatens the separate identity”, according to the protocol of a parliamentary debate on the issue.</p> <p>This provoked fury from leftwing Israelis and cultural leaders, many of whom have long been critical of the rightwing prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/novel-about-jewish-palestinian-love-affair-is-barred-from-israeli-curriculum\">Novel about Jewish-Palestinian love affair is barred from Israeli curriculum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one video shared on social media in reaction to the controversy, Arabs and Jews kiss on camera to break what they call a taboo in Israeli society.</p> <p>Rabinyan, 43, describes herself as a “proud Zionist”, the political movement for creation and consolidation of Israel as a Jewish state. She said, however, that pretending such relationships did not exist would be foolish. </p> <p>“Literature is a mirror,. [My critics think] if they eliminate the mirror maybe the reality will vanish as well. They see Palestinians as a mass, and [the Palestinians] see us as a mass as well. To look into each other’s eyes, as happened between my characters, is very rare for an Israeli to experience,” she said</p> <p>The education ministry appeared to row back from its previous position on Thursday. “The book wasn’t disqualified, but merely not included among the books studied” in the extended high school literature programme, it said.</p> <p>The ministry added that while teachers were still permitted to study the book with their students, it would not be included in the final exam.</p> <p>The novel is the latest cause célèbre in longstanding clashes between the government and cultural figures. In June, the education minister, Naftali Bennett, leader of the rightwing Jewish Home party, pulled state funding from an Arab play he alleged showed a Palestinian attacker in a sympathetic light.</p> <p>Amos Oz, one of the country’s best knownauthors, said in November he would not attend events at Israeli embassies overseas because of the government’s “radical” policies.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fjhb","wordcount":"653","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/1843105223a76f7fac541a404db64cea44f980db/0_156_5076_3047/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>Israel’s

Leo is new and everyone wants to find out about him and why he moved schools. Together they meet and they exchange secrets that they have guarded, although there is no such things as secrets in Eden Park School.<br /></p> <p>This book was such an enlightening read and I was captivated. David and Leo`s story is just special and all the struggles they go through are realistic, making the book even more interesting. Even though transgender issues are a controversial topic, Williamson writes so that this genre doesn’t take over the whole book but it is still the main subject; she does this by adding some growing-up themes and a teenage voice. This makes the book much easier to read and you can relate to the characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bad3971842d5700c5ed088b492fa5828004cb445\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bad3971842d5700c5ed088b492fa5828004cb445/0_0_257_400/257.jpg\" alt=\"fdf\" width=\"257\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Furthermore the plot twist that happens half-way through the book was completely unexpected. The plot twist was necessary because the book was dragging a bit and there wasn’t any “action” so you needed something to keep the interest of the reader; the plot twist did this. I enjoyed the plot twist because it made me realise that sometimes life isn’t fair and you always need to follow you heart. The characters were just so real and some people could say they were inspirational because they have always stuck to their gut instincts.</p> <p>Overall I enjoyed this book and I found it an easy read that consisted of LGBTQ+ themes and coming-of-age themes. I recommend this book to everyone because I think that everyone will benefit from this book and read about a story that we have not heard as much. It was also an enjoyable read which you won’t have any trouble reading.  </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

after the huge success of the <a href=\"http://www.ur-web.net/PeterMayMain/lewispage.html\">Lewis Trilogy</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/entry-island.html\">Entry Island</a>. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/359390/\"><strong>Coffin Road</strong></a> (Quercus, £18.99) returns us to the Outer Hebrides, in this case Harris, where in the opening chapter a man is washed up on the shore, unable to remember who or what he is. It transpires that he is, or may be, a writer who has been researching the mysterious disappearance of the keepers from the Flannan Isles lighthouse in December 1900. But when he returns to the lighthouse to corroborate his theory, he finds a dead body in a nearby chapel. Which raises the question: is he also a murderer? From this bare premise May conjures a clever, twisty eco-thriller in the mode of Le Carré’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/constant-gardener.html\"><em>The Constant Gardener</em></a>. Selective amnesia is hard to render convincingly – your sense as a reader is usually that it has more to do with plotting convenience than neurology – but May just about pulls it off, while making the atmospheric most of his isolated locations.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"32fe7a9768c61fd64a6cfc24ae31075537060099\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/32fe7a9768c61fd64a6cfc24ae31075537060099/0_0_262_400/262.jpg\" alt=\"Book jacket of Rain Dogs by Adrian McKinty\" width=\"262\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/adrian-mckinty\">Adrian McKinty</a>’s Sean Duffy thrillers set in 1980s Belfast come thick and fast, but the quality remains constant. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/362982/\"><strong>Rain Dogs</strong></a> (Serpent’s Tail, £12.99) finds the sarcastic detective investigating the apparent suicide of a Financial Times journalist at Carrickfergus castle. It turns out to be a murder, and the second locked-room mystery of Duffy’s police career. The tension between McKinty’s competing love of tight, formal puzzles and loose, riffing dialogue is what makes the Duffy novels such a joy. McGinty indulges himself here, inventing a visit to Belfast by Muhammad Ali and packing Duffy and his colleagues off to Broadmoor to interview Jimmy Savile in his creepy caravan. The latter scene feels a bit <em>avant la lettre</em>, but is enormous fun. (“He’s a bit different with the cameras off, isn’t he?” Lawson said. “He’s a bit of a … ” “Fuckface?” I suggested.) The last chapters suggest Duffy may be on the verge of becoming a responsible adult. I hope not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc44c73f7254f37b31cfff7b245ed5bb6d468ba7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bc44c73f7254f37b31cfff7b245ed5bb6d468ba7/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Book jacket of The Widow by Fiona Barton\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a journalist for the Daily Mail, <a href=\"http://fionabartonauthor.com/\">Fiona Barton</a> reported on some notorious court cases. Her much‑hyped debut <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/361124/\"><strong>The Widow</strong></a> (Bantam, £12.99) is marinated in awful knowledge gleaned in the course of her work and as a result feels solid and convincing. Essentially it is the story of Jean Taylor, whose husband Glen was accused of abducting a two-year-old girl. Now that Glen is dead, Jean is free to tell her story to journalist Kate Waters, who is poised to whisk her away to a luxury hotel where the grand inquisition will take place. But what is that story, exactly? How much did Jean know about the paedophile activities she calls “his nonsense”? Barton is fascinated by the way loyalty breeds both denial and collusion, and has channelled that into a taut, highly effective thriller. My one reservation is Jean’s odd voice, which feels too 1950s-prim – an upper-middle-class person’s slightly dated idea of how lower-middle-class people speak. But then, Glen and Jean are nothing if not strange, so perhaps that extends to their domestic idiolect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"df2003fd13423f626e0d4432517f321fe7171a30\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/df2003fd13423f626e0d4432517f321fe7171a30/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"Book jacket of Black Widow by Chris Brookmyre\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Publishing’s obsession with shiny debuts rightly annoys veteran novelists who understand that practise makes perfect. It is 20 years since <a href=\"http://www.brookmyre.co.uk/\">Chris Brookmyre</a>’s debut <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/quite-ugly-one-morning-2.html\"><em>Quite Ugly One Morning</em></a>, but <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360443/\"><strong>Black Widow</strong></a> (Little, Brown, £18.99), his latest thriller featuring journalist Jack Parlabane, is exceptionally good – a knotty mystery that’s not just richly, provocatively political but one of the most perceptive excavations of a dysfunctional marriage I can remember reading. The unhappy couple are driven surgeon Diana Jager and IT guy Peter, who seems to be the tonic she needs. Diana’s life has been a mess since she was revealed to be the anonymous author of a blog exposing sexism in surgery. But then Peter is killed in a car accident … Brookmyre plays a cunning, careful game, allowing Diana to co-narrate so plausibly that we are never sure if she is genuinely empathetic (and therefore unfairly maligned as a psychopath) or just brilliant at emulating emotion for our benefit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e659a23e995750f2c4973571b45734bd7702f531\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e659a23e995750f2c4973571b45734bd7702f531/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Book jacket of Viral by Helen Fitzgerald\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The embarrassing video that goes viral leaving misery in its wake is fast becoming a thriller cliche. Helen Fitzgerald’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370109/\"><strong>Viral</strong></a> (Faber, £12.99) has a look-at-me opening sentence – “I sucked 12 cocks in Magaluf” – that doesn’t bode well, but quickly redeems itself, developing into a nuanced and perceptive look at social media and misogyny. At its heart is the old-fashioned, analogue story of shallow, bullying Leah and her clever adopted sister Su, who goes to earth when an uncharacteristic lapse of judgment wrecks her life. Their furious mother, who is a judge, packs Leah off to Spain to look for Su while she plans her revenge on the man who first uploaded the clip. A good one for older teens.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fbbc","wordcount":"808","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/59cd1a930bffb2641953345b61eee04d4cf7f560/0_101_4368_2621/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-19T14:48:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Coffin

Chapter headings range from “Immunity of heads of state and other state officials from the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign state” to “The immunity of heads of state and other state officials as rules of customary international law”.</p> <p>“Basically, Pedretti is arguing that incumbent heads of state can’t be charged and prosecuted by a foreign court, whereas past heads of state can,” wrote Vox, quoting Pedretti’s statement that: “Immunity <em>ratione personae</em> prevents incumbent heads of state from being subjected to foreign criminal jurisdiction.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/30/malala-yousafzai-fatima-bhutto-review\">I Am Malala by Malala Yousafzai – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UN did not provide details on how many times the title had been checked out, but later clarified to Michelle Nichols, Reuters correspondent at the UN in New York, that it was the “most popular ‘new’ book, acquired July 2015, borrowed twice and checked out for browsing four times”, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michellenichols/status/685130244836175872\">Nichols tweeted</a>.

poems: clay","trailText":"That from which the first man was made, or the ground in which nothing grows … clay has associations with both creation and decay. Send us your poems about the sticky stuff, either way","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>When you hear the word “soil”, you tend to think of growth, organic life, fertility. “Clay” is another matter entirely. It’s dead, sticky and wet, it sucks you down, nothing grows in it, it’s useful only to the potter. While this may be a little unfair to the stuff, I suspect that this is how most of us view it.</p> <p>But there is another side to clay. In the Bible creation story, as in many other similar myths, God made the first man from clay, and this association of clay and flesh endures in modern literature.</p> <p>In Patrick Kavanagh’s long poem <a href=\"http://allpoetry.com/The-Great-Hunger\">The Great Hunger</a>, clay takes on the character of a malevolent deity from the opening line: “Clay is the word and clay is the flesh.” The echo of the Gospel of St John reflects the idea that the heavy Monaghan earth from which Maguire, the protagonist of the poem, wrestles a living is both his god and the locus of his slow, frustrated death-in-life. The end of the poem is an “apocalypse of clay”; a vision of abandoned hopelessness, with Maguire a lustless, lifeless clay figure of a man.</p> <p>For Frederick Manning, <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/266/93.html\">writing from the front</a> during the first world war, the trenches were “Endless lanes sunken in the clay”, ironically vivid with wild flowers, but also somewhat like arteries and veins running through the clay of the soldiers’ bodies. And in the background, the choice of clay rather than earth or mud reminds the reader that these trenches would end up serving as graves for many of these same bodies.</p> <p>A world war later, the child <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/245046\">Roy Fisher</a> sees the bombed garden where his aunt, his two cousins and their neighbour died as “a pod filled with clay”, with the centre of the crater a “smooth clay saucer”. The twin meanings of the word, literal and metaphorical, fold into one another in images of quiet power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b84a646a417b042f13f4148e0c764f9f4276617e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b84a646a417b042f13f4148e0c764f9f4276617e/0_665_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Cows by Stephanie Quayle (2013), clay, chicken wire, steel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Cows by Stephanie Quayle (2013). Clay, chicken wire, steel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Quayle/Saatchi Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This association of clay and death is as old as poetry. In <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0064%3Asonnet%3DLXXI\">Sonnet LXXII</a>, Shakespeare uses the rhyme with “decay” to emphasise the finality of the separation of lovers that happens when one of them dies. In his poem <a href=\"http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/nigg\">Nigg</a>, the Scottish poet Ken Morrice reminds us that clay is part of a geological reality that is far older than poetry, and links red sandstone, red clay and the blood of the dead who lie buried in it in a single process of natural indifference.</p> <p>Of course, for many poets the reality of clay is as interesting as its symbolic meanings. <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/165/18.html\">Carl Sandburg</a>, characteristically, saw it as a source of work – hard, back-breaking, boot-sucking labour, to be pitied or envied depending on the onlooker.</p> <p>Of all the poets who have written about clay, the one who was most fully immersed in it was Jack Clemo, whose centenary falls later this year. Clemo lived and died in the clay country of Cornwall, an area that supplied the potteries of Britain with much of their raw material, and his poetry is saturated with the stuff. Clemo was deaf and blind for most of his writing life, which might help explain the attraction of this tactile material to him as a poet. Also, his deeply held religious beliefs and his ecological views infused his view of clay as more than mere matter.</p> <p>In poems such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sense-of-place.co.uk/Rescorla/clemo.htm\">The Clay Pit Worker</a>, Clemo celebrated nature’s power of survival, the resilience of life which means that even the most unpromisingly clayey bit of waste ground is ultimately reclaimed by the green world. You don’t have to share the specifically religious aspect of his vision to share his delight in this regeneration.</p> <p>And so this month, we turn our poetic attention to clay in all its malleable forms. You may think of clay as the word, the flesh or the pits, or any combination of these things. It’s time to dig into your inspiration pit and shape the material you find there into a well-wrought urn in verse.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhgk","wordcount":"665","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/5aec19a8e07e4200d76a2ce2e9f06e129825bf6f/0_55_2000_1201/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>That from which the first man was made, or the ground in which nothing grows … clay has associations with both creation and decay.

Halfway home, on a lonely stretch of Geelong road, he swerved across a dam into a deep, manmade pond. He swam free; all three of his children drowned. Farquharson told the police he’d suffered a coughing fit and passed out at the wheel. His wife supported him. The trials and appeal that followed took seven years and gripped Australia. They also drew the attention of one of Australia’s greatest living writers, Helen Garner, who after visiting the “little white crosses, three of them, knee-deep in grass” embarked on her third book-length account of a court case.</p> <p><em>This House of Grief</em> is in many ways similar to <em>The First Stone</em>, Garner’s controversial take on a university sexual harassment case, and <em>Joe Cinque’s Consolation</em>, the more straightforward – though still furious – story of the murder of a working-class Italian-Australian by his student girlfriend. As in these books, Garner takes us into the Victoria Courthouse and lights its daily rituals with her limpid prose: “in the high, white space of Court Eleven, everything gently shone. Counsel’s chairs and microphones waited in rows down the long table. Cool air streamed in from some mysterious source.” Again, she shows us Melbourne’s lawyers, florid in their roles: emotional defence barrister Morrissey, “big, fair, and bluff, Irish-style, with the bulk and presence of a footballer”; “lean, contained-looking” prosecutor Rapke.</p> <p>Again, Garner shows us her facility for recording speech and, even more remarkably, the “waves of emotion and private mental activity” of group listening, now honed to almost hallucinogenic clarity. She conveys the pained excitement of the courtroom as Farquharson is condemned by the evidence of a friend who tricked him into confidences while wearing “a wire down the front of his pants”; then changes pace to give us the thrilling cut and thrust as Morrissey takes the betrayer to pieces. Equally vividly, Garner portrays how “the air in the court became a jelly of confusion and boredom” as all who were listening were bogged down for days in the details of the way Farquharson’s car – the car about which he was engaged in a bitter and crucial ownership dispute with his wife – skidded off the road into the water: “The judge took off his spectacles and violently rubbed his eyes. Journalists sucked lollies to stay awake. Jurors’ mouths went square with the effort to control their gaping yawns.”</p> <p>Here, too, are Garner’s characteristic sympathies: with working people, immigrants, mothers. She is drawn to the drowned boys’ grandparents, Bev and Bob Gambino, as she was to Joe Cinque’s parents. She depicts their daughter, Cindy, as a sensual, heavy lidded, modern Madonna. She detects in the rough young men on the stand – Cindy Gambino’s new partner, the carpenter who pulled Farquharson out of the dam – “that little buzz of glamour peculiar to the Australian tradie”. On the other hand, she turns on Rapke’s young, female deputy the acidic eye with which she etched Cinque’s murderer – the eye for strutting and stilettos and entitlement.</p> <p>And here, in every scene, is Garner herself, thirsty for coffee, wisecracking, observant: her very own USP. For she takes the opposite path to Truman Capote when it comes to accounts of crime. Rather than abstract herself from the scene, as Capote did writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/100-best-novels-84-in-cold-blood-truman-capote-observer-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\"><em>In Cold Blood</em></a>, she includes or even obtrudes herself, brandishing her armfuls of personal baggage. In <em>The First Stone</em>, this method seemed to have arrived by accident: Garner wrote impetuously and publicly to the accused before the trial or the book began; after that, she was cast as her own gadfly. In <em>Joe Cinque’s Consolation</em>, though, when the story is more violent and her involvement more distant, the discussion of personal sympathy became a delicate political tool. It was as if by admitting the chips that bristled on her own shoulder – working class, white, Lutheran, feminist, child of the sexual revolution – Garner was inviting us to discount them from her story, to get to our own truth. In this third book the approach has changed again. Now, rather than play the alienated gadfly, or get an exclusive angle, she sits and chats to the other writers, weaving herself into the court, the community of witnesses. When Farquharson is convicted, she is knitting, and marks the moment with “one red stitch. Then I knitted to the end of the row, and cast off.”</p> <p>This is a communal, painful effort: the lawyers and jury are engaged in the difficult understanding that a man murdered his children, and so is Garner. Together, they watch the police reconstructions of the sinking car, witness the anguish of Farquharson’s wretched, betraying friend. Everyone is resistant to the obvious conclusion: as a lawyer walking past the court says, “I’ve got two reactions to this. He can’t possibly have done it. But there’s no other explanation.” Garner makes herself her own experimental subject: she identifies and dismantles her defences against taking in this thought – that she hopes, for example that if Farquharson is found not guilty, the boys will be restored to life – and observes two juries doing the same. Then she takes down her defences against believing that this man was essentially different from her. Painstakingly, she shows us his sisters, his gestures, his handkerchief: he was ordinary, his life was ordinary, yet he really did plan to kill his children because of an argument over a car.</p> <p>This careful record of the mind and its workings, of the strange dance we take toward truth, makes the narrative compelling and the story fresh through all the trials and retrials. It also insists that Farquharson and his children belong to all of us. As Garner says as she returns in her mind to the boys’ graves, after their father’s last appeal is rejected: “Every stranger grieves for them. Every stranger’s heart is broken. The children’s fate is our legitimate concern. They are ours to mourn.” It’s an elegiac farewell, and indeed the whole book feels final, elegiac – perhaps because for all the horror, it is so elegantly and calmly written; perhaps because <em>This House of Grief</em> completes so many arcs begun in Garner’s previous works; perhaps because it is impossible to imagine it being done better.</p> <p>• Kate Clanchy’s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293544/s/the-not-dead-and-the-saved/\" title=\"\"><em>The Not-Dead and the Saved</em></a> (Picador).

There were so many great events. I saw Anne Fine, who told us how she started school at three years old and that that children often mistake her name for Anne Frank. Then I met David Almond and heard he had found his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/skellig-8.html\">Skellig</a> really easy to write. Robin Stevens’ event was all about murder mysteries. We discovered loads about her upcoming Murder Most Unladylike mystery book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/380416/\">Jolly Foul Play</a> (the fourth in the series, out in March), which is going to be set back at Deepdean. I got to have a one-to-one chat with Robin after the event, so I hope you enjoy my interview. I can’t wait for the next Books on Tyne festival to meet more authors next year!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78c9116a27a429cfc30305f85a166d72b879d81a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/78c9116a27a429cfc30305f85a166d72b879d81a/0_0_1538_2339/658.jpg\" alt=\"First Class Murder cover\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Mars Bar27: Your books are set in the 1930s, do you think the Wells and Wong series will eventually reach the war?</strong><br /></p> <p>Robin: I’m trying to age them up slowly because I’d them like to stay as young teenagers. If they got a year older in each book like Harry Potter, they’d age too quickly. I’m definitely moving towards the war, as the fifth book will take place at the end of 1935. If they did reach the war, I know what they would do. Hazel would work at Bletchley Park as a code-breaker and Daisy would be a spy, like <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/charlotte-gray.html\">Charlotte Gray</a>. I have ideas for what they could do in the war, and it would be lovely to write up to that point or to write something set in the future.</p> <p><strong>Do you think if you have set it later in the 1930s, it would reach that point?</strong></p> <p>I definitely chose 1934 as the setting for my first book on purpose, because it’s written in between the first and second world wars, and nobody seems to know much about that time. I’m also a big fan of history!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/20/robin-stevenss-top-10-capers\">Robin Stevens's top 10 crime capers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>I’ve heard one of your books may be turned into a TV series. Which of your books that you would most want to see on screen?</strong></p> <p>I’d love to have a series, and the producer wants to film each one of them for TV! The one I’d most like to see as a TV show is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/arsenic-for-tea.html\">Arsenic for Tea</a> because I love the setting and there are such great characters.</p> <p><strong>If you could be in the TV series yourself, who would you play?</strong></p> <p>I’d play a tree or a maid - I’m not very good at acting. There was an author whose books were made into a TV show and she got to be in the background, so I think that’s what I would want.</p> <p><strong>What would be your ideal bun break treat?</strong></p> <p>If it was a cake, it would be coffee or walnut cake and if it was a biscuit, it would be a chocolate chip cookie or gingerbread.</p> <p><strong>In your books, you mention how Hazel hates the squashed fly biscuits – do you agree?</strong></p> <p>I hated them when I was Hazel’s age, there’s always the moment when you realise that it’s not chocolate.</p> <p><strong>Have you got any other ideas for the detective society?</strong></p> <p>Book five is a Christmas themed one, which will take place in Cambridge, because Daisy’s brother goes to Cambridge and they are visiting him for the holidays. It will be based in a college, in the snow, but I haven’t planned it out yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b8505146515bccf3a4e0410947cd045fa47902d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9b8505146515bccf3a4e0410947cd045fa47902d/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Foul Play cover\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In your new book (out 24 March) <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/380416/\">Jolly Foul Play</a>, the fourth book in the Murder Most Unladylike series, you said there will be some new characters - are some of the original students going to return?</strong></p> <p>Kitty and Beanie come back as bigger roles, and Lavinia, who didn’t play a huge role in the other books. This time she also joins the detective society, which is really cool. There are also younger girls who play bigger roles like Betsy North and Binnie (Kitty’s little sister). I couldn’t bring back many teachers, so it’s all new big girls, head girls and teachers. This time it’s one of the big girls who is the victim!</p> <p><strong>In your first book Murder Most Unladylike, you describe Lavinia as if she was angry, she’d just knock someone over.</strong></p> <p>Yes, she’s got so much rage! Someone asked me who I was most like apart from Hazel, and I said Lavinia. She’s me when I’m most angry - she’s so aggressive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>And finally have you got any tips for aspiring crime writers?</strong></p> <p>Plan your crime, the moment that it happened and who did it, and why.

Someone by Hayley Long – review","trailText":"<strong>ThoughtfulReader: ‘</strong>I think this is a brilliant and unique novel with fascinating word choices and a captivating plot’","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In this novel, the reader follows Sophie as she learns that her parents have kept many secrets from her and her brother Hercule. Sophie’s family live in Brussels, capital of Belgium. But Sophie’s family haven’t always lived there. Sophie has memories of coming on the train from England, and she wonders if she’s somehow fabricated the truth as she seems to remember odd things about the journey like her mother putting on a wig in the station toilets. But that can’t have really happened… can it? </p> <p>This book is unlike any other book I’ve ever read. I was completely taken by surprise at how cleverly some ordinary words were substituted for others throughout the whole novel. The story is narrated by Sophie, and for example, instead of using the word internet, she used the word introvert. In a sentence, you would immediately understand what Sophie meant without having to reread the sentence and it’s crazy how well this works. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb47b93f96732898863097be594f327a3bb99cf4\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fb47b93f96732898863097be594f327a3bb99cf4/0_0_245_400/245.jpg\" alt=\"fdf\" width=\"245\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here’s a sentence I picked out from the book</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the living root, I chucked myself down on the softy and lay – fax down – on the softy’s big squishy cushions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, it’s obvious that root means room, softy is a replacement for sofa, and by fax Sophie means face. This sentence can be read almost without realising that some words have been replaced. And once I was into the second chapter, I think I stopped noticing at all, it just seemed natural. But sometimes, I had to pause and try and think what word Sophie meant, and when this happened, it was quite frustrating to be honest, and the flow of the novel was lost. This was the only thing which I disliked. But on the whole, I think the replacing of words worked really well. It really makes the writing style unique and keeps the reader interested.</p> <p>Overall, I think this is a brilliant and unique novel with fascinating word choices and a captivating plot. I would recommend this to children aged thirteen and upwards because it is not always easy to understand what the ordinary word is which Sophie is replacing. I think this book is certainly is a good contender for the 2015 Costa Children’s Book Award prize.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Last year, I joined a glittering array of children’s authors in being invited to speak. I was to appear on a special panel about the YA Book Prize with Louise O’Neill, Non Pratt and, my personal inspiration, Malorie Blackman.</p> <p> I drove my tired ass from the airport to Hay-On-Wye, the picturesque village where the festival takes place. Things didn’t get off to a <em>great</em> start when I parked the rental car against a plant pot at the hotel, scratching the bumper (an error I would later be fined £300 for). Nonetheless, I headed over to the festival site to meet up with Hot Key Books staff and the other authors for lunch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2802c62f89339280309920b02586d809cf9b18e8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2802c62f89339280309920b02586d809cf9b18e8/0_378_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juno Dawson at Hay festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here’s Juno Dawson when she was known as James (second from right) with fellow teen authors Louise O’Neill, Malorie Blackman and Non Pratt at Hay festival, on the day of her anxiety attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> I’ve been very lucky to do a lot of festivals and panel events. To be honest, they’ve never really phased me and I don’t get nervous. Before the event I was in good spirits, but then, about five minutes before we were due to go on stage, things took a very dark turn indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/08/mental-health-ya-fiction-teenagers-speak-out\">Mental health and books: teenagers speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Before I divulge the horror of what happened next, allow me to explain Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Since I was a teenager, I’ve had IBS. Lots and lots of people do, we just don’t talk about it because we’re oh-so British and we don’t talk about bums, willies and ladygardens. The problem is that IBS – no one really knows what it is or why it happens – is at least partially psychosomatic, meaning it has a psychological element and physical consequences.</p> <p> For whatever reason, as we were being fitted with microphones, an IDEA entered my head: “you’re going to be sick,” an insidious little voice said.</p> <p>“I’m not,” I told myself, but immediately, my <em>head</em> started scanning my body for signs I might be ill. I <em>had</em> just eaten. I <em>did</em> feel quite full. Maybe I <em>would</em> be sick.</p> <p> From the first thought – <em>you’re going to be sick\u001F – </em>I entered a downward spiral that went something like this:</p> <p>You’re going to sick</p> <p>You’re going to be sick on stage</p> <p>You’re going to be sick and <em>Malorie Blackman</em> will see</p> <p>You’re going to be sick and Hay Festival will be horrified</p> <p><em>They’re all going to laugh at you, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(1976_film)\">Carrie</a></em></p> <p>You’ll never be invited to another festival</p> <p>You’ll never get another book deal</p> <p>You’ll never write another book</p> <p>You’ll have to be a rent boy or worse, a teacher (I used to be a teacher)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/11/valentines-day-why-love-hurts-catherine-johnson\">Why love hurts – and it's always worth it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By this stage we had been shepherded on stage (festivals run a very tight ship) and I fudged my way through a question about the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/love-hurts.html\">Love Hurts</a><em> </em>anthology (to this day I don’t remember what I actually said). My downward spiral was out of control, as you can see. None of it makes sense, I know, but when your heart is pounding and your head is spinning, it really feels like it could happen.<br /></p> <p> This is an anxiety or panic attack. The brain allows the release of a massive amount of the hormone adrenaline and your body is a slave it to. It triggers the “fight or flight” response, and on that occasion my body’s reaction was to feel like I was going to simultaneously vom and poop myself. Combine that with my life events – sleep deprivation, dehydration, a four hour drive, being a tiny bit transgender – and it was all too much.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/04/this-book-is-gay-james-dawson\">Why my book is gay: and I'm proud of it</a> </p> </aside>  <p> When my heartbeat reached critical mass, I turned to Louise O Neill and whispered, “I have to get off this stage.” I legged it, much to everyone’s confusion, pulling off my little Britney head-mic as I went. One of the Hay volunteers helped me outside and showed me the way to the nearest toilet.</p> <p> I was not sick. It was all in my head.</p> <p> You see, as soon as I realised the world was not going to end – Malorie didn’t even stop mid-sentence as I fled – I was fine. The panel carried on just fine. I got some fresh air and said I was OK to go back onstage. I had a choice: I could say nothing, or tell the truth. So I told the truth. I went back and explained that sometimes I have anxiety attacks.</p> <p> The audience, the other panellists, the organisers of the festival were nothing but warm and supportive. The clap I got when I came back to the stage was a real turning point. I had nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/02/mental-health-relapse-holly-bourne-am-i-normal-yet\">Why we need to be honest about OCD and teen mental health</a> </p> </aside>  <p> That said, I wasn’t prepared to risk a career I’ve worked <em>very</em> hard on. I’m not going to let my mental health stop me. It’s funny; before the festival I had just completed my new book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368025/\">Mind Your Head</a> but hadn’t been on SSRI medication (anti-anxiety drugs) before. This time, I decided enough was enough. I went to my GP and he agreed a course of mild anti-depressants would be the way forward, especially as we’d never tried them before. It took a couple of goes to get it right, but once we found the right drug, it made a huge difference.</p> <p> Now, when my head sends me a thought like “you’re going to be sick”, my brain <em>and</em> body responds with a “no, I’m not actually – you’re just an idea, do one.” As it is, after seven months on escitalopram, I came off the drug, this time with better coping strategies for when I felt an attack coming on.</p> <p> I wish I’d accepted that my IBS was a mental illness sooner. I wasted so much time thinking I had a stomach complaint. The reason I didn’t is because of the stigma around mental health. Basically, I didn’t want to be thought of as a broken, fragile, mad person. I don’t feel fragile and I don’t feel broken. In fact, once I was on the right drugs, I got better rapidly. You know, like I had any illness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa716e3db83a12bff0bdebb2a5819fc6f69b26da\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa716e3db83a12bff0bdebb2a5819fc6f69b26da/0_0_2030_3118/651.jpg\" alt=\"Mind your Head by Juno Dawson\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> The driving force behind <strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368025/\">Mind Your Head</a></strong> was, not only to give advice and strategies for dealing with life, but to reduce the stigma around mental illness.

The council usually charges only £10 to those who want to use the image to cover paperwork fees, granting permission to requests for usage that will promote Skegness.</p> <p>Town clerk Steve Larner, who grants permission for usage of the Jolly Fisherman, told the Echo that he “wouldn’t have given permission in this case as [the cover] doesn’t mention Skegness”, adding “if the image is used to promote Skegness, then generally speaking it is for the benefit of the town, and if it brings people in then it’s positive”. Bryson does mention Skegness in the travelogue, recalling arriving in the town on the “most miserably rainy weekend of the summer”. “As I could see, there was nothing wrong with Skegness that moving it 800 miles south couldn’t fix,” Bryson writes, adding that: “people everywhere were standing in doorways or under awnings. A few were eating fish and chips, but most just stood staring at the bleak wet world. It wasn’t in the least bit bracing.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98cbe15609a41ef9a9ecc4dd4ae486c568ca26e9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/98cbe15609a41ef9a9ecc4dd4ae486c568ca26e9/0_0_1664_2560/650.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bryson’s The Road to Little Dribbling.\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Bryson’s The Road to Little Dribbling, complete with Jolly Fisherman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transworld Publishers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for Transworld said that “given how extensively the image has been reproduced in the past, it was presumed that the image was in the public domain. Now it has been established that the image is in copyright until 2018, we are in contact with Skegness Town Hall with a view to confirming permission.”<br /></p> <p>Larner told the Guardian that “after positive conversations with the publisher” he was now working with Transworld to resolve the issue.</p> <p>According to Transworld, “the use of the Jolly Fisherman as part of the cover illustration of Bill Bryson’s book was inspired as a tribute to the iconic nature of the image, which Bill writes about with much affection in his chapter about Skegness”, pointing out that the author also writes positively about the town.</p> <p>“It was the most traditional of any English seaside resort I had encountered,” Bryson writes. “There was lots of bright neon and noisily chiming arcades and a sickly smell of spun sugar which even the rain could not obliterate. The seafront was dominated by a handsome clock tower, with a good-looking park called the Tower Gardens standing nearby.”</p> <p>Adding that “everyone knows one thing about Skegness, and that is that it is bracing”, Bryson also goes into <a href=\"http://jollyfisherman.co.uk/jolly-fisherman-history.html\">the history of the 1908 poster</a> by illustrator John Hassall, which shows the beaming fisherman on the beach, with the caption: “Skegness is so bracing.”</p> <p>“It is a splendid illustration, but what is especially interesting, I think, is that it gives no hint of sunshine, frolicking swimmers, donkey rides, deckchairs or any other traditional seaside amusements. The man is dressed for foul weather and is quite alone, yet that one image and four simple words have made Skegness famous – indeed, have persuaded hundreds of thousands of people to go there,” writes Bryson. “Hassall was paid 12 guineas for the work. The original hangs in Skegness Town Hall. I would love to have seen it, but the building was closed as it was the weekend.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ftn2","wordcount":"598","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2d44e8c9bc0ce35fd06d9d47dd0943f630b943fa/122_378_5100_3063/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-14T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Skegness’s

Nietzsche thought of himself as an educator, but the time he spent working in higher education was not long and much of it he found frustrating. Appointed professor in classical philology at the University of Basel in 1869 when he was only 24 years old, he was seen as a prodigy with a brilliant career ahead of him. However, he left academic life in 1878, due to his worsening health and increasing disillusionment with institutionalised scholarship. The writings for which he is most remembered were written in the following decade, which he spent wandering restlessly around Europe. Then, in 1889, he suffered a disastrous mental collapse from which he never recovered.</p> <p>Until his death in 1900 Nietzsche remained a mute invalid under the guardianship of his sister <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/forgotten-fatherland.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Elisabeth</a>, a repulsive individual with whom he quarrelled bitterly when she married an antisemitic high school teacher, Bernhard Förster, and accompanied him to found an “Aryan” colony, Nueva Germania, in Paraguay. Following the failure of the fly-blown settlement and the suicide of her husband, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche continued promoting racist ideas by seizing control of her helpless brother’s writings, establishing a <a href=\"http://www.klassik-stiftung.de/index.php?id=344\">Nietzsche Archive</a> and methodically deleting passages in which he lambasted the “race swindle”. For this service she was duly rewarded. On the basis of a highly selective biography and a heavily redacted compilation of Nietzsche’s writings that she published under the title <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/277730/\"><em>The Will to Power</em></a>, she was several times nominated by admiring German academics for the Nobel prize in literature. When she died in 1935, Hitler attended her funeral.</p> <p>By the start of the 20th century Nietzsche was recognised as one of the leading thinkers of the age. His influence was vast, though rarely of a kind of which he would have approved. He despised nationalism and railed at the Prussian cult of the state, ridiculed the faux Darwinism that was emerging as the ruling German ideology, attacked the leading antisemites of his day and preferred the religion of the Old Testament to Christianity. Yet he has been widely seen as an intellectual forerunner of fascism, and even a proto-Nazi – crass misreadings. But if Nietzsche was neither of these things, nor was he any kind of liberal. It is his critique of liberalism that makes him worth reading.</p> <p>Beautifully produced by New York Review Books in a new translation, by <a href=\"http://www.damionsearls.com/\">Damion Searls</a>, with an illuminating introduction, <em>Anti-Education</em> consists of five lectures Nietzsche gave at the Basel city museum in 1872. (A sixth lecture was planned, but never delivered; portions of the series were used in his book <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/philosophy/philosophy-texts/nietzsche-untimely-meditations-2nd-edition?format=PB\"><em>Untimely Meditations</em></a>.) Presenting his critique in the form of a series of dialogues between an old philosopher and a student companion, Nietzsche argues that education (he uses the German word <em>Bildung</em>, a term with multiple senses but that broadly means the formation of culture and individual character) has been degraded by being subordinated to other goals. Both the German gymnasium – the secondary school that prepared students for university – and universities themselves had forfeited their true vocation, which was to “inculcate serious and unrelenting critical habits and opinions”. Instruction in independent thinking had been renounced in favour of “the ubiquitous encouragement of everyone’s so-called ‘individual personality’” – a trend Nietzsche viewed as “a mark of barbarity”. As a result, education was dominated by two tendencies, “apparently opposed but equally ruinous in effect and eventually converging in their end results. The first is the drive for the greatest possible expansion and dissemination of education; the other is the drive for the narrowing and weakening of education.” The first extends education too widely and imposes it on a population that may not want or need it, while the second expects education to surrender any claim to autonomy and submit to the imperatives of the state.</p> <p>There is more than a little truth in Nietzsche’s indictment. But to reach this nugget, you will have to wade through pages of Romantic gibberish about the aristocracy of the spirit and the privileges of genius, which foreshadow the absurd figure of the <em>Übermensch</em> that he concocted in his later work as a redeemer for modern times. But when he observed that education was increasingly being shaped by external forces, Nietzsche was on to something important. A shift of the sort that was under way in 19th-century Germany began in the UK with the regime of monitoring and assessing research that was imposed in the late 1980s. Until that time universities had been autonomous institutions. Now they have to justify themselves as somehow increasing national output – a requirement that denies that intellectual life has value as an end in itself and assumes everything of importance can be measured.</p> <p>Other forces within education itself have been at work undermining universities as places dedicated to independent thinking. The American cult of political correctness may have begun as a response to ugly practices of discrimination, but it soon morphed into a regime of taboos and dogmas. With the rise of “trigger warnings” and the demand that campuses become “safe places” sheltered against intellectual disturbance, it may not be long before the notion that universities exist to promote unfettered inquiry has vanished from living memory.</p> <p>There will be some who say this is a sign that liberal values have been abandoned. For those who think like this there is a simple remedy for the maladies of higher education. We must return to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/14/guardian190-john-stuart-mill-obituary\">John Stuart Mill</a>: let any idea however offensive be freely expressed, so that it can be challenged and where necessary rationally rebutted. But at this point Nietzsche poses some awkward questions. Mill believed everybody gained from freedom of expression, including those who wanted to shut it down: all human beings want the benefits that come from growing knowledge. But what if many are happy to relinquish these benefits for the sake of values they consider more important and want to impose on others? Mill’s answer is that what matters is the continuing advance of the species. But as Nietzsche understood, the idea of “humanity” as a collective agent with universal goals that it pursues in the course of history is a secular residue of a religious faith in providence. If you stick to empirical observation, all you will find is the human animal with its many conflicting values and ways of life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/my-hero-nietzsche-geoff-dyer\">My hero: Friedrich Nietzsche by Geoff Dyer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nietzsche’s achievement was as a genealogist of morality, and his observations on the origins of liberal values are peculiarly resonant today. As a pioneering classical scholar, he knew there was nothing liberal about ancient Greek culture. Emerging in a long and difficult process that included Europe’s wars of religion, a liberal way of life was an offspring from Jewish and Christian monotheism – a fact our “new atheists” prefer to ignore. One can value this way of life without being religious, but that doesn’t mean all human beings want to live it. If people lose interest in free expression – as seems to have happened in some sections of higher education – there is no argument that can persuade them of its importance. What they want may be freedom from the dangerous business of thinking.</p> <p>The editors of <em>Anti-Education, </em><a href=\"https://germanic.osu.edu/people/reitter.4\">Paul Reitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.iasc-culture.org/people_faculty.php?ID=20\">Chad Wellmon</a>, describe Nietzsche as “an anti-academic philosopher of modernity and its ills”, and conclude that answering the questions he asked about education “might bring us little comfort” today. Anti-academic Nietzsche may have been, but his mistake was in pinning his hopes on “high culture”. If you look beyond the walls of the academy, you will find a scene that is remarkably vital. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/24/macbeth-director-justin-kurzel-australian-film-maker-snowtown\">Justin Kurzel’s film of <em>Macbeth</em></a> presents an uncompromisingly truthful vision of the human situation unlike anything in the academic study of the humanities at the present time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\"><em>The Wire</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> explored the contradictions of ethics with a rigour and realism that is lacking in the baroque disquisitions on justice and altruism that occupy philosophers. Amazon’s version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philipkdick\">Philip K Dick</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/16/amazon-pilot-season-man-high-castle-new-yorker-presents\"><em>The Man in the High Castle</em></a> is a more compelling rendition of the slipperiness of consensus reality than you will find in any number of turgid volumes of critical theory. Plenty of other examples could be cited. Many educational institutions may be enmeshed in bureaucracy and self-censorship, but the good news is that they are not forming our culture.</p> <p><strong>• </strong>To order <em>Anti-Education: On the Future of Our Educational Institutions </em>(RRP £8.99)<strong> </strong>for £7.19 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/349568/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

<br>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>“Ouch! Yarooh! Leggo, you beasts!” Billy Bunter, the Fat Owl of the Remove, will bellow, chortle, and cachinnate again on Saturday night in Leeds when the Northern Section of the Old Boys’ Book Club recreates the adventures of the schoolboy characters invented by <a href=\"https://www.stellabooks.com/featured-book/billy-bunter-by-frank-richards\">Frank Richards</a>, who died on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>At this monthly meeting, however, members will hold a brief requiem for Richards before invoking the ghost of the Fat Owl.</p> <p>These men and women, whose average age is about 50, relive their childhoods by collecting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/06/horror-fiction\">penny dreadfuls</a>, twopenny bloods, and, most of all, the school adventures written by Charles Hamilton under the name of Frank Richards and many other names. They have grieved deeply over his death.</p> <p><strong>Brought joy<br /></strong>In a letter of “heartfelt love” sent to the old man shortly before he died, the treasurer, Mr G. Allison, wrote: “In our opinion, you have brought more joy, pleasure, and happiness into this world of ours than any other person now living.”</p> <p>A large claim that. But for many collectors of boys’ books Greyfriars is so real that it is almost their second old school. One has only to look at their programmes to see how members have created a cult out of Bunter, the Famous Five, and their school friends.</p> <p>In one programme, described as “bumper” - and there is a word one does not normally find outside the blurbs of juvenilia - Mr G. Wilde composed a Greyfriars theme as it might have been written by Hoskins, the mad musician at the school who sometimes paid fags to listen to his works. They (the fags) stuffed their ears with cotton wool. The members listened entranced.</p> <p>Mr John Allison, brother of the treasurer, translated for members a Bunter story written in Latin by Frank Richards for the “Times Educational Supplement.”</p> <p><strong>Men in caps<br /></strong>At one meeting a group of grown men solemnly donned schoolboys’ caps to play parts in “Who Killed Gosling?” a play written by Mr G. Allison. Gosling, the Greyfriars porter, has been bribed with a flask of whisky by those cads and bounders, Vernon-Smith, Skinner, Snoop, and Stott, to let them break bounds. The insufferable, the ineffable Bunter substituted water for the whisky because they would not let him go with them. Gosling died from the shock - or rather appeared to do so, for all Greyfriars characters are too good to lose.</p> <p>Truly the funfulness is terrific at the meetings of the Northern Section of the Old Boys’ Book Club, as Hurree Jamset Ram Singh might say.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ftjb","wordcount":"421","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6b664024cb756900817d3e7ab295cf2ab42ef7a8/0_0_3516_2109/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-11T05:00:12Z","standfirst":"<p><strong>8

Now, to mark the anniversary of the murders in Paris, more than 100 students and academics from Oxford University have come together to translate the extracts into English.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b50836165e0453cb87099701ad399f664f403db8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b50836165e0453cb87099701ad399f664f403db8/292_271_1485_2228/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tolerance: the French anthology was a kiosk hit.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolerance: the French anthology was a kiosk hit.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Voltaire, whose Treatise on Tolerance <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/16/voltaire-treatise-tolerance-besteller-paris-attack\">became a bestseller last January</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2015/jan/18/beginners-guide-voltaire-philosopher-free-speech-tolerance\">whose face adorned Je Suis Charlie posters</a>, makes the cut numerous times in the book of extracts. The 35 French academics who put it together last year chose a range of texts by the author, from an extract from his novel Candide, as the optimistic character discovers the horrors of the slave trade and renounces his “obsessive insistence that everything is fine when it couldn’t be worse”, to his poem La Henriade, about Henry IV and the religious wars in France during the 16th century.</p> <p>“What do you say to a man who tells you that he prefers to obey God not men, and who is convinced he will earn his place in heaven by slitting your throat?” writes Voltaire, in a quote taken from his Philosophical Dictionary.</p> <p>But the collection, <a href=\"http://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/418\">published free online today in English as Tolerance</a>, also includes extracts from Diderot – “Precedent and imitation, miracles and power can all create dupes or hypocrites. Only reason can create believers” – Montesquieu and Rousseau, as well as English, German and Spanish writers.</p> <p>The English philosopher John Locke is included for his Letter on Toleration, in which he argues for a separation of church and state, and writes that “the toleration of those that differ from others in matters of religion is so agreeable to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to the genuine reason of mankind, that it seems monstrous for men to be so blind as not to perceive the necessity and advantage of it in so clear a light”.</p> <p>France’s <a href=\"http://www.openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-203-5/ch1.xhtml#_idTextAnchor006\">Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</a>, from 1789, also makes the cut, opening with the line: “Men are born and remain free and equal in their rights.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"836bab33dded2c746785a23cd82ec685346a08ca\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/836bab33dded2c746785a23cd82ec685346a08ca/0_0_200_240/200.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Caroline Warman of Oxford University: ‘We all need access to these texts.’\" width=\"200\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Caroline Warman of Oxford University: ‘We all need access to these texts.’</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Caroline Warman at the University of Oxford, who led the project to translate the French original, said that “so many students and colleagues” had wanted to be involved. More than 100 students and tutors of French from 15 Oxford colleges worked on the text, with the support of the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies, and Open Book Publishers, which today published the book for free online.</p> <p>“We thought it was something we could do to show our support for France and for all countries in the world affected by these issues,” said Warman. “We want this book to reach people thinking about tolerance and intolerance, and to inspire them to connect with our history, as they discover that major European thinkers of the past also wrote passionately about these topics.”</p> <p>In her introduction to the book, Warman writes that the French academics who put the original anthology together “were convinced that it would be of burning interest to those beyond academia, and made a gift of it to the French public, for whom and on behalf of whom these 18th-century thinkers were writing in the first place”.</p> <p>“We all need access to these texts, because they belong to us all: they are the inheritance of everyone who lives in society and are particularly necessary in times of conflict,” she writes. “This is where our translation comes in ... At every stage, this has been a collective effort, a celebration of fraternity – that third term in the famous French trio.”</p> <p>Warman said she wrote the preface to the book in the week after the more recent attacks in Paris, “and it was very difficult to do – I had to acknowledge what had happened but I tried not to be too emotional about it”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\"

Between 500 and 1,000 younger men are said to have been involved in the attacks; around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne\">100 complaints have been made, two-thirds of which are about sexual assault</a>. The incidents prompted calls for German chancellor Angela Merkel to rethink her open-door policy to refugees.</p> <p>Okwonga, who has won prizes for his poetry, <a href=\"http://www.okwonga.com/how-to-deal-with-the-sexual-assaults-in-cologne/\">writes on his blog</a> that “many of these attackers were already known to the police, and were not drawn from the recently-arrived refugees … [but] that’s not going to stop this conversation being dominated by the issue of race, so we may as well go there”.</p> <p>In an essay, Okwonga goes on to argue that it is more important to focus on a woman’s right not to be assaulted than on race. “As far as being a black man of African descent goes, the racists in Germany and elsewhere hate us anyway,” he writes. The Harry Potter author deemed it “the best comment I’ve read on the Cologne attacks, written by a black man of African descent living in Germany”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cultural expectations of black men in some parts of Germany are already dangerously low</p> <footer> <cite>Musa Okwonga</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Okwonga laid out how Germany is “not particularly diverse” racially, that the majority of the black and Arab people who live there are working class, and there is “a tendency, more widespread that many people might like to acknowledge, to regard black men as inherently untrustworthy or criminal”.</p> <p>“In Berlin, where I live, the overwhelming majority of black men you see every day are poor, homeless, or selling drugs by Görlitzer Bahnhof or Warschauer Strasse, two of the city’s busier train stations. And when I say the overwhelming majority, I would say something like 80%, if not more,” he writes.</p> <p>While he loves living in Berlin, Okwonga says some Berliners will leave a space next to him, even on crowded trains, “somehow fearing the prospect of sitting next to a male of African appearance”, and adds: “The cultural expectations of black men in some parts of Germany are already dangerously low.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/statuses/684831644734369794\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Okwonga\">@Okwonga</a> Usual character limit problem meant I couldn&#39;t get your name into retweet!

Why don’t we just start with the premise that it is a woman’s fundamental right, wherever she is in the world, to walk the streets and not be groped. And why don’t we see this as a perfect moment for men, regardless of our ethnic backgrounds, to get genuinely angry about the treatment of women in public spaces: to reject with fury the suggestion that we are somehow conditioned by society forever to treat women as objects, condemned by our uncontrollable sexual desires to lunge at them as they walk past.”</p> <p>Okwonga continues: “Let’s do our best to challenge the rampant misogyny, which has gone on worldwide for far too long, and reject whatever lessons of sexist repression we may have been taught. Because women are tired of telling us about this, and exhausted of fighting a battle that for too long has gone overlooked.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/dec/19/musa-okwonga-ode-this-is-football-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3yamv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2015550\"            data-video-name=\"Musa Okwonga's ode to 150 years of the FA: This is Football – video\"            data-video-provider=\"FA\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/18/1387379066094/Musa-Okwongas-ode-to-150--005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-425304627\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_8467150.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball/131218ThisIsFootball.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Video: Musa Okwonga’s poem This is Football, which was commissioned by the Football Association to commemorate its 150th anniversary.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Okwonga, who has written two books about football, won the WH Smith young writers’ competition in 1996 and has been commissioned to write poems for the BBC World Service and the Football Association.

I thought I would pick up a car somewhere and drive to exciting new places: Greece, Slovenia, Poland, Spain. Inevitably, once I arrived in London, reality set in. There was a shared flat and a job in theatre to be found. Once I had secured both of those, it was a lot harder to pick up and leave. I’ve taken weekends and odd weeks here and there, to see some of the places on my list, but it’s a long way from the dream of a few months with just a backpack for company. </p> <p> Thank goodness.</p> <p> I have been living out of a suitcase for the past nine weeks. What I have realised in this time is that I’m not really the backpacking type. I could live the rest of my life in one pair of shoes and a couple of different dresses, but am hopelessly attached to my mixer. I like my knives and my big navy woollen blanket and my frankly ridiculous collection of cookbooks. The generosity of my extraordinary friends (and <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/12/21/crystallised-ginger-the-adventure-of-the-christmas-pudding\">aforementioned adopted family</a>) means that I have been thrilled to be staying on sofas and in spare rooms, with clean towels and cups of tea, instead of in hostels, sharing a room with 16 strangers and showering in my flip-flops. But I have been moving around quite a bit, packing and unpacking my bag with alarming regularity. And it’s not something I fancy doing again, even though I realise how incredibly lucky I’d be to be able to do it around Europe. The truth is, I like being at home.</p> <p> The travelling time in these past months (flights, London buses, the <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/8/13/marzipan-the-miniaturist\">longest train journey</a> I’ve ever taken) have afforded me luxurious hours for reading. When I was starting to feel a little rootless and was longing for my old flat back, I read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/23/the-book-of-strange-new-things-michel-faber-review\">The Book of Strange New Things</a><em>. </em>It certainly put my wistful thoughts into perspective. The central character Peter is (quite literally) light years from home and his wife Bea, working with strange aliens and even stranger human colleagues. On a long and unfamiliar drive, Grainger provides him with what must surely be the most comforting food on Earth: bread, still warm from the oven. Faber details the ingredients – some brought from Earth, some found on Oasis. The bicarbonate and egg make it sound like a variation on soda bread. </p> <p> Best served with a generous scrape of butter, this is simple comfort food (and comfort cooking) at its best. For Peter, so far away from home, and for me, feeling a little bit lost without mine, it was just what was needed.</p> <h2><strong>Raisin bread: the recipe</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes 1 loaf – 10 or so slices</strong></p> <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br /> 450g plain flour<br /> 40g butter<br /> 1tsp salt<br /> 5g sugar<br /> 1tsp bicarbonate of soda<br /> 275ml buttermilk<br /> 1 egg<br /> 100g raisins</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f250d2394e4aa1c0c636ea064fa3a628124ecd0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4f250d2394e4aa1c0c636ea064fa3a628124ecd0/0_161_1064_739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"flour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Faber details the ingredients – some brought from Earth, some found on [a planet called] Oasis.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <strong>Equipment</strong> <br /> Mixing bowl<br /> Sieve<br /> Measuring jug<br /> Baking tray<br /> Greaseproof paper<br /> Serrated knife</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1</strong> First, preheat the oven to 210C. Once the oven is hot, you can start with the rest of the recipe. The bread needs to go straight in the oven once it is shaped, so do have it hot first.<br /></p> <p><strong> 2 </strong>Pour the flour into the bowl and rub the butter through it until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Sieve the sugar, salt, bicarbonate of soda into the flour and toss through with your hands.</p> <p><strong> 3 </strong>Combine the egg and buttermilk in a jug. Pour the flour mixture out onto the bench. Make a well in the centre, then pour the buttermilk in. Using a fork, bring the flour into the liquid and mix until combines. Work quite quickly here, as you want the bread to be in the oven while the bicarbonate is reacting with the buttermilk. Knead the dough very briefly, incorporating the raisins evenly through the dough as you do.</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Shape the dough into a ball, and place on a lined baking tray. Make a deep cross in the top, cutting down at least half the height of the loaf. Bake for thirty minutes, until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the base. Leave it for at least ten minutes (but not much longer) before slicing into it. It won’t keep as well as most breads, so do toast it if you’re eating it after the first day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a54f81c6411eddd7910f975159a275a3a923e3fd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a54f81c6411eddd7910f975159a275a3a923e3fd/0_154_1047_833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"raisin bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Best served with a generous scrape of butter, this is simple comfort food (and comfort cooking) at its best.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
