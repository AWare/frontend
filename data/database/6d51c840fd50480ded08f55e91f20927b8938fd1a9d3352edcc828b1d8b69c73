Its power to surprise and provoke shock is just as great now as it was when it was then, perhaps even more so as global issues of racial and religious disharmony of all kinds appear to be increasing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00c2bfbba8ade1c38a25044f85592b83110e5a0f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/00c2bfbba8ade1c38a25044f85592b83110e5a0f/181_0_671_1030/651.jpg\" alt=\"Noughts and crosses\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Malorie Blackman’s simple reversal of racially stereotypical roles is a clever and highly effective way of focusing on the how, in any society, racism is threaded through almost every aspect of life. The dark skinned Crosses are the top group in the society, while the pale skinned Noughts are the under-class who had once been slaves. This allows Malorie Blackman to make points about the ingrained assumptions about different racial groups, without having to step carefully around current sensitivities. </p> <p>Against this background, the love story between Sephy, a dark skinned Cross and Callum, a fair skinned Nought, is agonisingly played out as the two go from the apparent ease of their permitted pre-school friendship to the distance that is bound to come between them as they grow up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/video/2014/jul/25/comic-con-malorie-blackman-yalc-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4v8fq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2132027\"            data-video-name=\"Malorie Blackman: my quest for diversity in children's books – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/24/1406226298655/Comic-con---Mallory-Black-012.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-442964032\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/07/24/140725MaloryBlackman_9327537.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/25/140725MaloryBlackman-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/25/140725MaloryBlackman.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/25/140725MaloryBlackman_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/25/140725MaloryBlackman_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Malorie Blackman speaks to us about diversity in children’s books. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>While charting the horrible moments of disharmony, from the personal slight of the colour of a plaster to the more corrosive deliberate separations imposed by society such as segregated schools, Malorie Blackman never misses a trick in identifying the seemingly endless disadvantages of any underclass. </p> <p>But she also give hope as, first through Sephy and Callum and later through their daughter Rose in subsequent titles in the Noughts and Crosses sequence (Knife Edge, Check Mat and Double Cross), that each generation will challenge those prejudices and so gradually bring changes. There is also a <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308554/\">graphic novel of Noughts and Crosses</a> (adapted by Ian Edginton and illustrated by John Aggs) which is not to be missed. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4dc57a207417bececb8ec1f72e93caa5fe0f24e2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4dc57a207417bececb8ec1f72e93caa5fe0f24e2/0_0_309_475/309.jpg\" alt=\"Half Bad\" width=\"309\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In her series of high concept novels which begins with <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/half-bad.html\">Half Bad</a>, Sally Green explores similar issues around prejudice and stereotypical expectations. In the world she has created the polarity is between white witches and black witches (labels that don’t refer to colour, rather ‘good’ or ‘bad’). </p> <p>Both types of witches have clear characteristics and behaviour. But then a boy is born who is Half-Code; the illegitimate son of the most powerful black witch in the land he is neither one nor other. Although much less obviously a social commentary and set in a world that is far further removed from reality than Noughts and Crosses, Half Bad and its sequels <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/half-wild.html\">Half Wild</a> and Half Lost (out in March) are thought-provoking about the dangers of classifying people by their labels and not by their own characteristics and ability to think independently. Like Malorie Blackman,Sally Green gives hope that an individual can make a difference. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/06/my-inspiration-sally-green-wuthering-heights-emily-bronte\">My inspiration: Sally Green on Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also in the realms of fantasy, there are two strands of conflict one based on “blood” and the other on “belief” underlying the narrative in the JK Rowling’s Harry Potter titles; the Muggles versus the magical world and then, within the magical world, those who are followers of Voldemort and those who are not. </p> <p>Harry himself exemplifies a union between the two; he is half magical and half-Muggle and everything he does is designed to ensure that the two worlds live in harmony. </p> <p>For a very different view of the long standing prejudice against anyone with dark skin, a recent novel with a historical setting will also set readers thinking. The conditions of slaves even in a comparatively enlightened household makes horrifying reading Jon Walter’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308920/s/my-name-s-not-friday/\">My Name’s Not Friday</a>, the story of a young boy’s experiences. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"21a860cad55bd03c0b3b2fa85dfef9112096e818\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/21a860cad55bd03c0b3b2fa85dfef9112096e818/0_0_572_842/340.jpg\" alt=\"My Name’s Not Friday\" width=\"340\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samuel becomes friends with the son of the owner of the plantation on which he is a slave but, like Sephy and Callum, their friendship is across an unbridgeable divide. Samuel is denied everything – even the right to read.</p> <p> Skin colour is not the issue in Joan Lingard’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kevin-and-sadie.html\">Kevin and Sadie novels</a>. In them, she uses the very different setting of the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> <p>In this case, the chasm between Kevin and Sadie is religion not race. Sadie comes from a Protestant family; Kevin’s family are Catholics. Growing up in Belfast, their religions are meant to keep them apart but, like Sephy and Callum (or Romeo and Juliet before them), the two first become friends in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/twelfth-day-of-july.html\">The Twelfth Day of July</a>, and develop their friendship into a romance in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/across-the-barricades.html\">Across the Barricades</a> and later, as the series continues in Into Exile, even into getting married. Joan Lingard shows that the next generation doesn’t have to adopt the engrained hatred of their parents. Instead, as in Noughts and Crosses, they can see things freshly and, especially when impelled by friendship or love, strive to change the world around them.</p> <h2><strong>If you have great recommendations on this theme let us know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnChildrensBks\">@GdnChildrensBks</a> or by emailing childrens.books@theguardian.com and we’ll add your ideas to this blog.

Written by Natasha Carthew, the story follows Trey on his desperate quest for vengeance, and begins as he finds himself in a camp for young offenders, where he knows his parents’ killer works.</p> <p>The story is told in an unusual, flowing style with little punctuation which makes it seem more like a train of thoughts than a coherent telling of a tale. The style is also rather lyrical, which shows off Carthew’s talent for all encompassing description; at times, however, this leaves room for little else. Carthew’s grasp and description of emotions within the book is brilliant and definitely ensures the reader understands how Trey is feeling, as it is told from his perspective.</p> <p>The downside of this author’s style is that I was often left feeling as if I didn’t completely understand where the characters were, or what was going on and why. So much of the writing is focused on emotions that the other essential aspects of a story often fell a bit flat. In particular I found the characters difficult to identify or empathise with; perhaps this is because I have never been in a young offenders camp or anything remotely similar to their situation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b4b6e42adcfe9b1246ad70f23571074c8d89f814\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b4b6e42adcfe9b1246ad70f23571074c8d89f814/6_6_205_316/205.jpg\" alt=\"light that gets lost\" width=\"205\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Carthew still describes her characters brilliantly, however often she seems to tell the reader things rather than show them. For example, the only leading female character in the book, Kay, is repeatedly described as wild however never do we see this wildness in action, we merely have to take Trey’s word for it. So, because of this, the characters seemed very two dimensional to me, and I never really became attached to them. Hence, when events that should have been massively significant in the story occurred, I found myself hardly bothered.</p> <p>Another part of the book I struggled to comprehend was the passage of time; I couldn’t work out how long the characters spent anyway doing anything, which isn’t something I usually notice in a story. I certainly noticed the lack of it in Light That Gets Lost. </p> <p>There is a possibility that this two dimensional grasp of the world is because the story is told from the point of view of Trey and his life revolves around revenge, however if this was the point I think it passed over my head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Cooke","headline":"An epic tale briefly told","trailText":"Set in 1930s Germany, Fred Uhlman’s novella Reunion is a simple story of friendship in not so simple times","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I’d never heard of Fred Uhlman, the German-born writer and artist (1901-1985), or of his novella <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/reunion-4.html\" title=\"\"><em>Reunion</em></a>, until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/25/nicola-beauman-persephone-books-founder-interview\" title=\"\">Nicola Beauman</a>, the publisher of Persephone Books, pressed it into my hands. At the time, I wasn’t in need of any new paperbacks; my toppling to-read pile was in danger of getting its own Channel 4 documentary. But she was so fervent, and the book so slight – the Vintage edition runs to just 78 pages – it would have been rude to refuse it.</p> <p>Appearances, however, are deceptive. <em>Reunion</em>, which was first published in 1971, can indeed be read in about the same time as it takes to drink two martinis. But boy, does it punch above its weight. Set in Stuttgart in 1932, it is an account of the friendship of two teenagers: Hans, the middle-class son of a Jewish doctor, and Konradin, scion of a noted aristocratic family. Both have a passionate interest in history, and against the odds – snobbery is rife in their ultra-competitive school – this brings them together.</p> <p>But their beloved Germany is changing. Sides will have to be taken, loyalties adhered to. Disgust, rejection, fear, exile, stoicism, bravery: these are the things the years ahead will bring, even if their pattern will not be fully revealed for many decades. Uhlman’s story, which takes on the most terrible crime of the 20th century, could easily have wound up a fable, pat and sentimental. Somehow, though, it never comes close to being so, perhaps because he is careful not to lose sight of the bonds from which its beginning is forged. A daring miracle of narrative simplicity, its end comes at you like a torch in a long tunnel. All is black, calamitously beyond words, and yet the eye, swiftly followed by the heart, is drawn to it: at last, a circle of light. Even if history cannot be rewritten, Uhlman tells us, a life may sometimes have more than one act.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ffnp","wordcount":"327","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ac58157b27ed65b4cd02e3ce4e71939d5eefcc42/0_164_2104_1262/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"Set

couches stop moving,<br />even the lamps.<br />Like a squirrel suddenly aware it is being looked at.</p> <p>Say the word continuously,<br />and things begin to go forward.<br />Your life takes on<br />the jerky texture of an old film strip.</p> <p>Continue saying it,<br />hold it moment after moment inside the mouth,<br />it becomes another syllable.<br />A shopping mall swirls around the corpse of a beetle.</p> <p>Death is voracious, it swallows all the living.<br />Life is voracious, it swallows all the dead.<br />Neither is ever satisfied, neither is ever filled,<br />each swallows and swallows the world.<br /></p> <p>The grip of life is as strong as the grip of death.</p> <p>(but the vanished, the vanished beloved, o where?)</p> <p>In a review of Jane Hirshfield’s recent essay collection, Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World, in the New York Journal of Books, <a href=\"http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/ten-windows\">Larry Smith writes<em> </em>that</a><em> </em>the poet is “a practising Buddhist, but she is not confined by this and speaks to the largest audience of poetry lovers.” Hirshfield’s popularity is no doubt founded on the desire for poems that investigate large ideas in plain language, often through imagery from the natural world, and, without seeming to preach, offer the psychological or ecological insight often miscalled “spirituality”. </p> <p>Hirshfield herself has noted the importance of compassion, expressed by the reader as, “<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/03/14/392075809/windows-that-transform-the-world-jane-hirshfield-on-poetry\">Someone else has felt as I felt</a>.” This is a factor in her appeal, certainly, and it’s part of what drew me to this week’s poem. At the same time, a writer may freely share her suffering and other experiences with the reader, and leave the latter cold. Technique is important, tone only a little less so. Perhaps a stronger clue to the appeal of Hirshfield’s work comes in the same interview when she refers to “window moments” – points in the poem at which it changes focus, and seems to look out at a new, illuminating view. This is, perhaps, the larger-scale equivalent of the “cutting word” in the haiku, a form highly valued by Hirshfield.<br /></p> <p> For all the Zen-like intensity of their gaze and simplicity of means, Hirshfield’s poems are touched by a polytheistic imagination. They’re alert to the numinous and often allude to “the gods” and to an idea that the gods are fickle and may take back a portion of the generous gifts bestowed. The titles she favours for poems and collections are often a microcosm of her major theme. Life and death are pitted in an endless cycle, and there is no victor, no reconciliation, no redemption.</p> <p> As in Kelly Grovier’s recently featured poem <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/28/poem-of-the-week-the-three-rs-by-kelly-grovier\">The Three Rs</a>, language takes a central place in Poem With Two Endings. This time, it’s a word, not a phrase, and the specific word is “death”. The difficulty of uttering the word serves as metonymy for the difficulty of the experience itself. The difficulty embraces psychological and philosophical resistance: death is a concept life finds indigestible. Time ought to be stopped, but clearly, for the survivors, it goes on, raggedly but inexorably: “your life takes on / the jerky texture of an old film strip”. </p> <p>The poem initially presents an icy stasis – “even” the couches and lamps have stopped moving (were they moving earlier because swimming in tears?) like “a squirrel suddenly aware it is being looked at”. It’s the repeated uttering of the awful word that gets time’s engine restarted, and this involves defamiliarising it by repetition, bereaving it until it’s a meaningless syllable. This is all quite ordinary – until Hirshfield delivers her master-stroke – the image of the corpse of the beetle, itself a tiny word, with the pitiless ecology of the “shopping mall” evoking polysyllabic noise, clustered living bodies and magnified iridescence. Each death, it suggests, each corpse, can be immensely insignificant, and as immensely significant at the same time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p> It’s interesting that there’s a visible, physical “window” in Poem With Two Endings – that stretch of white space between the penultimate line and the last. Much more than a stanza break, it suggests a whole absent stanza. So it might better be compared to an unfurnished room, a room where there should be many things but where there is nothing but the recognition of loss. And, almost while that shock is registering, the last line, gentled by parenthesis, utters its unanswerable <em>cri</em> <em>de coeur, </em>“(but the vanished, the vanished beloved, o where?)”</p> <p> This is a new but wholly authentic voice in the poem. It doesn’t obliterate the sturdily stated paradox of the two endings: “Death is voracious, it swallows all the living. / Life is voracious, it swallows all the dead.” It simply adds the insatiable, tremulous, desolate human note.</p> <ul> <li>Poem With Two Endings is from Jane Hirshfield’s <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/each-happiness-ringed-by-lions-802\">Each Happiness Ringed by Lions: Selected Poems</a>.<em> </em>Hirshfield has published several collections, since, most recently <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jane-hirshfield\">The Beauty</a>, but the Bloodaxe “Selected” remains an excellent introduction for new readers.<br /></li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fy4x","wordcount":"828","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/003ed52c930670c116b4dffe278786a5d11b665e/0_269_5122_3076/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Language’s inability to express the reality of a death, and the human struggle to cope with it, are reflected in Zen-like verse</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/11/poem-of-the-week-poem-with-two-endings-jane-hirshfield","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/11/poem-of-the-week-poem-with-two-endings-jane-hirshfield","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"003ed52c930670c116b4dffe278786a5d11b665e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/003ed52c930670c116b4dffe278786a5d11b665e/0_269_5122_3076/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

Daily, I rode through Soho, Covent Garden and Holborn – the heart of their territory. As a young cycling enthusiast new to the metropolis, I watched with awe as these couriers knifed through static traffic, gybed down alleyways and surfed the gaps between buses, often wild-eyed, high on  car fumes and the expletives of seething pedestrians.</p> <p>The bike shop I then used was a courier hangout. One Friday night, I dropped in after work to pick up my bike. I had sheared off one of the cranks. The mechanic wheeled the bike out of the workshop, past three couriers sharing a can of lager. The old crank, a lump of aluminium, was strapped to my handlebar with a round of tape. Innocently, I asked what it was for. One of the couriers looked up and said: ‘You… stick… it… through… the… windscreen… of… a… car!’ They may have been winding me up, but my fascination with bike messengers – the only two-wheel subculture in the city and the voiceless vanguard in the struggle between cyclists and other road users – only deepened.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fine words flow on the simple but profound pleasure of floating through the city on a bicycle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I desperately wanted to read a book about the “courierhood” then. Wait 25 years and three are printed at almost the same time. Jon Day’s lucid essay <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/25/cyclogeography-review-jon-day-cycle-courier-london\" title=\"\"><em>Cyclogeography</em></a> came out last July. The long-distance cyclist and campaigner Julian Sayarer’s <a href=\"http://arcadiabooks.co.uk/books/Messengers\" title=\"\"><em>Messengers</em></a> is published this January, as is Emily Chappell’s beautifully written debut.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/9781783350537-what-goes-around.html\" title=\"\"><em>What Goes Around</em></a> is the story of the author’s years in the saddle, shifting packages back and forth through the capital’s streets for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pinkexpress\" title=\"\">Pink Express</a>. Chappell is a gifted storyteller. She deftly weaves in a potted history of couriering, from the explosion of the industry in the late 1980s when congestion brought traffic speeds down to a level that made the bicycle viable, through to its gentle decline at the hand of email attachments, file sharing software and electronic signatures. Occasionally prone to romanticising couriers and their battered, stickered, steel track bikes, Chappell does still manage to debunk some of the myths that have accreted over the decades.</p> <p>There are diverse asides – on how tall buildings are constructed and her love life, for example – which take the reader away from the teeming streets and slow the pace: to use a cycling analogy, they felt like a rim rubbing on the brake. She is particularly sensitive to the solidarity that exists among the unlikely crew of mavericks, artists, economic migrants, PhD students, people between careers and incurable outsiders that make up what she calls the “courier cloud”.</p> <p>In and out of all this, fine words flow on the simple but profound pleasure of floating through the city on a bicycle – of the “strange sense of stillness”, and “the energy of sheer motion itself”. On the repetitive nature of couriering, she writes: “much of the satisfaction of the job comes from the irrelevance of thought; the joy of watching your body develop its own intelligence; the satisfaction of subordinating reason to instinct”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/dec/16/a-cycling-return-home-exploring-the-lost-lanes-of-wales\">A cycling return home: exploring the lost lanes of Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chappell is very good at evoking the intimacy she achieves with London, a city so many find impersonal. She writes with delight about her favourite park benches and hot-air vents, the distinctive smell of certain streets and bridges, the moods of traffic at different times of day and the rarefied air of the stone-flagged quadrangles which she discovers, Alice-like, passing through hidden doors trying to deliver her packages.</p> <p>After one alarming incident, Chappell describes how the roads, and even the traffic, offered her succour. Going round Marble Arch, she writes: “I was back in familiar waters, flowing along on the currents I knew of old, as contented as a sea otter, asleep on the waves.” Over the months and the miles, she notes how she leaves traces of her sentiments around the city, building up a sort of bespoke, emotional A-Z, so that “the unlikeliest street corners will have some tattered threads of memory fluttering from them like a flag”.</p> <p>In the end, Chappell’s thirst for knowledge of the city is sated: she heads off to ride a bicycle round the world instead. Before departing, however, she devotes a chapter to the dangers of riding a bicycle in London. The full cast of cyclists’ nightmares are here – malevolent pedestrians, threatening white van drivers and sinister cabbies. Chappell sometimes felt that, as a cyclist, she was “in an abusive relationship with the rest of the city” and “a lightning rod for everyone else’s rage”.</p> <p>Anyone who rides a bike in London will find this part of the book chilling. Cycle couriers, it seems, are still at the vanguard of road wars in the capital. In Chappell, they have at least now found an intelligent, compassionate voice.</p> <p><em>Rob Penn is the author of </em><a

– by friends, family, colleagues, acquaintances, total strangers – what we’re working on. For a while now, my answer to that question has been “a novel about a girl who has a face transplant.” And believe me, people have had some pretty strange reactions. About half of my friends assumed I was working on a sci-fi or fantasy novel, or at the very least, taking some pretty big liberties with reality. Even some of the doctors I reached out to when I began my research had no idea what I was talking about! Everyone seemed to think the idea of a face transplant was kind of unreal.<br /></p> <p>And I have to admit, when I first heard of face transplants, my reaction wasn’t all that different. Before I began researching and writing <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360879/\">Faceless</a>, I didn’t know anything about these procedures. Even Maisie, Faceless’s main character, balks at the idea of a face transplant at first. <em>A face transplant can’t be a real thing</em>, she thinks. <em>It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, a horror story, a mad scientist’s experiment.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5bd95f076c1b3e069947f3135af8168028004fa\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d5bd95f076c1b3e069947f3135af8168028004fa/0_127_3264_1959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alyssa Sheinmel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alyssa Sheinmel: Maybe whoever we’re becoming at any given moment is exactly who we’re <em>supposed</em> to be.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/26/top-10-quotes-on-identity-for-teenagers-george-r-r-martin\">Top 10 best identity quotes for teenagers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once whoever I was talking to understood that a face transplant was a real – though rare – procedure, they usually had more questions. About the kind of research I was doing, about how I was structuring the novel, and often about whether a main character who’d been through something so extreme could be relatable to readers. “Aren’t you worried,” they asked, “that teens won’t be able to relate to Maisie?”</p> <p>I always answered <em>no</em>. Because while Maisie’s experience in Faceles<em>s</em> may be singular, not looking the way you think you <em>should</em> look unfortunately isn’t.<br /></p> <p>Most of us – thankfully – will never find ourselves in situations as extreme as Maisie’s. But a lot of us struggle to discover how much of <em>who we are</em> is tied to <em>what we look like</em>. How many of us look in the mirror and are occasionally disappointed, surprised – if not flat out shocked once in a while! – by the sight of our reflections? Sometimes it’s just a haircut a few inches too short or an outfit that looked different inside the store than it does at home, but the result is the same in the end. We see our reflections and think: <em>That’s not what I thought I looked like</em>.<br /></p> <p>It can take many forms. You don’t fit in with the cool kids. Your hair is too curly or too straight. Your outfits are too dressy or too casual. The one thing that’s universal is the <em>wrongness</em> of it. You’re not <em>supposed</em> to look like this. You were born to the wrong parents, in the wrong town, in the wrong skin, with the wrong parts. I spent so much of my own young-adulthood wishing I had different hair, different skin; that I was skinnier, shorter, that my lips were fuller, my nose smaller. Often, when I looked in the mirror, I was actually surprised to find that I hadn’t transformed myself through sheer force of will.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/08/teen-mental-health-ibs-juno-dawson\">We need to talk about mental health without shame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, of course, I <em>did</em> change. The girl I was my freshman year (first year of university) was so different from the girl who graduated.<br /></p> <p>And the change was more than physical. The 18-year-old me listened to different music than 14-year-old me. She watched different TV shows and read different books. She <em>wanted</em> different things. She was going different places, and with different friends. Things she thought would be the most important had fallen aside in favour of new most important things.<br /></p> <p>Maisie spends much of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360879/\">Faceless</a> trying to figure out who she is with this new face, in this new body – but at the end of the novel, she realises that her personality is so much more than a list of attributes. She would have changed even if she’d never been in her accident.

After all, our reflections will go on surprising us long after we graduate from high school: one day we’ll wake up to wrinkles and sun-spots, just like we used to wake up to acne and greasy hair. The eyebrows that we thought were too bushy are now the height of fashion and the crooked teeth that kept us from smiling now give our face personality. The college we wanted to go to rejected us – and our safety school turned out to be the perfect place. We outgrew our old boyfriends and best friends. We got sick and tired of our favorite city and our favorite foods and our favourite outfits and maybe even of some of our favourite people.<br /></p> <p>And maybe that’s okay. Maybe the key is to stop resisting all that change. Maybe whoever we’re becoming at any given moment is exactly who we’re <em>supposed</em> to be.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"203b362bf1e95770ff8f2c63dc79f9929cda83c9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/203b362bf1e95770ff8f2c63dc79f9929cda83c9/0_0_1523_2339/651.jpg\" alt=\"Faceless\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, at the end of the day, it was always easy for me to tell anyone who asked that I wasn’t worried about whether readers would relate to Maisie.

Though not so much as to cancel a soiree at which Pierre, a bastard by birth but not by nature, was to be introduced to Russian society.</p> <p>“Pierre is not one of <em>nous</em>,” several guests observed. “Not only does he forget <em>choses</em> but he doesn’t speak Frussian. <em>Et</em> he drinks even <em>plus que nous</em>.”</p> <p>Prince Andrew, a bastard by nature but not by birth, cleared his throat delicately. “As a member of the officer class, I have decided to join the army,” he declared.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/jan/05/war-and-peace-the-usual-complaints-unabridged\">War and Peace: the usual complaints, unabridged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Leave your pregnant wife if you will, Pierre said, willingly accepting the mantle of fecklessness. “I shall eat, drink and copulate for Russia. That will be my duty for the glorious Motherland.”</p> <p>“I shall join the hussars,” Nicholas declared, while his sister Natasha eyed up potential husbands. They might become rather scarce.</p> <p>Pierre checked his fob watch. The pages were turning faster than he expected and his father had now died. “I seem to find myself the richest man in Russia.”</p> <p>War proved more terrible than either Andrew or Nicholas has expected. Dreams as well as men got killed. “How I embrace death,” Andrew murmured as the battle of Austerlitz raged. “<em>Pas </em>so<em> vite</em>,” said Napoleon. “<em>Permettez-moi de vous donner une main</em>. Now I must wash my chubby little body.”</p> <p>“I’m home,” said Andrew as his wife died in childbirth.</p> <p>Pierre felt the burden of expectation and married Helene but, <em>helas</em>, she had a bit on the <em>cote</em>. The anguish was intolerable, but Pierre felt obliged not to kill his love rival in a duel and left St Petersburg for many years to ruminate on Freemasonry before deciding a knotted handkerchief was not for him. Instead, he chose to improve the lot of his serfs, who had up till now remained entirely invisible. “Harrumph,” he concluded at last. “I cannot improve their lot because they have never had it so good.” Tolstoy nodded approvingly, lifting his eyes momentarily from the handsome handmaiden beneath him.</p> <p>“So, 500 roubles on the peace lasting,” said Nicholas, as Napoleon and the Tsar embraced in friendship, thereby losing the remains of the Rostov fortune.</p> <p>Andrew observed Natasha longingly. “Marry me, please,” he begged. “Oh, I do love you ever so much, Nick,” Natasha replied, but my father is making me wait a year and I’m bound to have developed <em>une grande passion</em> for the inside of Anatole’s trousers by then.”</p> <p>“I am distraught,” Andrew declared as Natasha fell dangerously ill.</p> <p>It was now 1812 and Pierre was beside himself as the French approached Moscow. “‘I am deranged with symbolism and Helene has left me even though I left her first. I vow to kill Napoleon,” he said.</p> <p>“<em>Je ne peux pas </em>believe<em> que je </em>have just<em> perdu </em>the battle of Borodino,” Napoleon squeaked, his shoe-lifts giving him gip. “The French had by <em>loin</em> the best army.”</p> <p>“But Russia had nature and spirituality on its side,” said Tolstoy while a chorus of Volga boatmen sang patriotic songs.</p> <p>“Can you not <em>faire quelque chose</em> about the <em>fumee</em> in Moscow?” asked Napoleon. “<em>Et quand </em>will I receive the surrender?”</p> <p>“<em>Jamais</em>,” Mother Russia replied. First scorched earth, then General Winter. War is hell.</p> <p>Pierre hovered between madness and death as the French performed atrocities during their withdrawal from the icy embrace of Mother Russia.</p> <p>“There is a nobility in being broke,” said Nicholas’s aunt. “So I am going to give you some more money.” “Oh, thank you,” Nicholas replied. “Now I can marry Mary. And maybe you and Andrew can make up now, Natasha?”</p> <p>“I forgive you, Natasha,” said Andrew, before dropping dead.</p> <p>“That’s handy,” said Pierre, appearing out of nowhere. “Maybe I can marry you instead.”</p> <p>“Yes please,” Natasha whimpered. “I can give up my singing, we can have four children and I can become a right old drudge, because Leo thinks that submission is a woman’s natural state.”</p> <p>Tolstoy bowed his head. He was tired. The novel was a difficult thing. Not that his book was a novel, of course. Though people would be bound to call it that. Fools all of them. We can only know we know nothing.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g5s9v\" title=\"\">Hear Simon Callow read John Crace’s digested War and Peace on the BBC Today

After all, The Dead is regarded as one of the greatest short stories ever written.</p> <p>At Christmas time, my wife and I generally watch <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dead_(1987_film)\">the film version</a> and inevitably discover something new every time. Directed by John Huston, it is - like Joyce’s original prose - also a masterpiece. </p> <p>In Dublin last week we attended yet another version: a candlelight reading of the entire 16,000-word story by Aidan Gillen, resplendent in white tie and sitting at a desk throughout.*</p> <p>It is a tribute to Gillen and, of course, to Joyce that the audience was riveted as the poignant tale of Gabriel Conroy’s epiphany unfolded.</p> <p>I had previously overlooked the significance of the mention of a British newspaper, the Daily Express, by Conroy’s university colleague, Molly Ivors.</p> <p>She chides him for writing for the paper, calling him a “West Briton”, a derogatory term for an Irish person believed to be too much of an Anglophile and, by implication, lacking in patriotism.</p> <p>The Express was opposed to Irish nationalism and the remark stings Conroy, who also rejects Molly’s support for the Irish language, but he appears unable to answer her charge satisfactorily. </p> <p>Instead, in his later speech during dinner - after Molly has departed - he makes clear his opposition to the “new generation” she exemplifies. </p> <p>Joyce was writing just ahead of the 1916 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising\">Easter Rising</a>, an event that will be celebrated throughout this centenary year. Having attended Sinn Féin’s launch of its 2016 commemoration of the rising the night before, I realised just how prescient Joyce had been in highlighting the conflicting views of Gabriel and Molly.</p> <p>It is but one small incident in Joyce’s story, but it fits his overall theme about the paralysis of Ireland. Conroy’s marriage is also paralysed, as are the lives of the other characters.</p> <p>Joyce uses snow, a freezing blanket, as a continual image to reinforce his theme of immobility, returning to it in his memorable final paragraph. With his wife having cried herself to sleep, Conroy stares into the street at the falling snow:</p> <p>“Yes,” it begins, “the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland...” And it concludes: “His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.”</p> <p>By then, Gillen’s voice was almost a whisper, a contrast to the standing ovation he received.</p> <p>*The six performances at Dublin’s wonderful venue, the<a href=\"http://smockalley.com/the-dead/\"> Smock Alley Theatre</a>, were sold out, as were those at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in December. </p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fkkn","wordcount":"455","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/341c2369a81d0355afea80064a14bb47fd7a37d5/0_536_3116_1867/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-14T08:15:12Z","standfirst":"<p>How James Joyce used the Daily Express to illustrate Ireland’s coming clash </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jan/11/a-newspaper-moment-in-aidan-gillens-reading-of-the-dead","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/greenslade/2016/jan/11/a-newspaper-moment-in-aidan-gillens-reading-of-the-dead","sectionName":"Media","elements":[{"id":"341c2369a81d0355afea80064a14bb47fd7a37d5","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/341c2369a81d0355afea80064a14bb47fd7a37d5/0_536_3116_1867/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Karen Robinson","picdarUrn":"GD*29845833","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/341c2369a81d0355afea80064a14bb47fd7a37d5","suppliersReference":"Aidan Gillen","altText":"Aidan Gillen: his voice was a whisper by the end.

He avoided seeing his family to protect them, sent a neighbouring boy for his shopping to ensure he was seen as little as possible in public. But then he started a magazine that in its first edition provided information to mothers struggling to feed malnourished children – and this undermined an official narrative that the nation’s president had banished hunger.</p> <p>Yet he was not killed, unlike others brave enough to pursue proper journalism in Rwanda. Instead, he was broken in different ways – beaten by police, intimidated by people he thought were friends, forced to flee the country, threatened even in Uganda. Eventually this idealistic man was driven to self-destruction, terrified even to see a doctor for fear they were secret agents. “The government had not needed to kill him,” writes <a href=\"http://www.anjansundaram.com/\" title=\"\">Anjan Sundaram</a>. “They just made him useless, ruined his mind with paranoia by turning on him those he loved and trusted most.”</p> <p>The tragedy of Gibson runs like a thread through this slim book by Sundaram, a reporter who spent almost five years in Rwanda after freelancing in the neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\" title=\"\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. He was the author’s favourite student on a journalism training project funded by Britain and the European Union, which gave him a ringside seat on the creeping repression of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/paul-kagame\" title=\"\">Paul Kagame</a>’s government. The result is a superb exposé of a dictatorship as he observes how the tentacles of totalitarianism squeeze the life from a society.</p> <p><em>Bad News</em> is an important book that should shatter any lingering faith people might hold in Kagame’s hideous regime. Sundaram details how his students end up crushed by the system, either promoting its Orwellian messages or behind bars if they refuse to conform. One becomes the president’s propagandist. Another, who befriends him, turns out to be a government stooge. A third ends up paraded before the press in prison garb, her head shaved and child effectively orphaned; she was sentenced to 17 years in jail after state prosecutors said she implied Rwandans were unhappy with their rulers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/jan/03/paul-kagame-and-others-damage-africa-lust-to-rule-for-ever\">The Observer view on Rwanda and Paul Kagame’s lust for power | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The doomed futility of his work is seen when his class discusses an article about Victoire Ingabire, the opposition politician who returned from Holland to run against Kagame in 2010, only to be accused of “genocidal ideology” and thrown in jail. Newspapers called her a criminal before her trial, while reporters smeared her with false sex claims. “How do you expect otherwise?” asks one journalist. “If we don’t call her a criminal the authorities think we are on her side. They have even threatened my children. But if we say she is guilty they leave us alone. So we call her a villain, genocidal.”</p> <p>Such damning details offer unusual insight into a police state that became an aid darling in the west. It opens with the writer investigating an explosion, only to be told by a security official that he was imagining things. He explains how Kagame exerts control through a benign-sounding system of villages, the nation broken down into small blocks of families, each with a head, security officer and informer. On the one hand, this led to the sudden eradication of plastic bags – but on the other, it strips away privacy and ensures constant monitoring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a desolate work, taut prose describing the stifling atmosphere of a nation trapped in fear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sundaram travels deep into the country during the rainy season to discover scenes he compares to war, the landscape littered with huts destroyed and traditional grass roofs burnt off. Children are sick, old people shake with malaria, families are squashed together in makeshift shelters or living with animals. Yet he is mystified since there are no signs of conflict. Finally, villagers admit they destroyed their own homes after a government order, leaving him pondering the humiliation of a woman who tells him Kagame is a visionary for such signs of progress. “She said the president was a kind man for thinking of the poor.”</p> <p>This is a desolate work, taut prose describing the stifling atmosphere of a nation trapped in fear. Yet equally depressing are the delusions of western donors, played so skilfully by Kagame as they funnel huge sums into his state then serve as cheerleaders for this bloodstained war criminal. He has just shown again how he manipulates “democracy” with a referendum to ensure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/rwanda-vote-gives-president-paul-kagame-extended-powers\" title=\"\">he can stay in power until 2034</a>; as Sundaram says, who dares vote against such a government when it orders people to mark ballots with thumbprints?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9957fbb80a066efc665a3fdf8c75826f92e4c334\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9957fbb80a066efc665a3fdf8c75826f92e4c334/0_141_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Kagame\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Kagame, who can remain in power until 2034.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The author admits even his small programme was mandated not to challenge the government, sticking only to sanctioned subjects such as “poverty reduction”. One embassy official warns if they mention repression they will be expelled. When concerns over freedom of expression emerge, a committee is set up to investigate, with journalists represented by a former police officer. Donors invest in a parliamentary radio station, equip the electoral body with technology, train a media council – then entrust such projects to the government, ensuring they are used to tighten its grip.</p> <p>Sundaram says the result, with even United Nations bodies banned or bullied, has created “a mirage of a country”. Papers open as journalism is destroyed. Parties appear as political space disappears. Criticism of Kagame’s brutal actions during the genocide is silenced. At one stage, the author questions a foreign diplomat about pouring money into the regime’s pocket. “I have no problem with giving money to a dictator,” the smug diplomat replies. “I’m proud to be giving him money... we will influence the government in the right direction.”</p> <p>Such shameful stupidity shows how western governments end up as accomplices to terror and apologists for despotism. The book ends with a list of journalists assaulted, deported, forced to flee, jailed, kidnapped, killed or going missing after criticising Kagame’s government. It takes 12 pages to detail all the cases yet Sundaram admits it is not exhaustive.</p> <p><em>Bad News is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99). </em><a

But, according to David S Abraham, there’s another reason we should be impressed with our devices – they are a veritable compendium of chemicals. “The iPhone itself has half the elements known to man in it,” he explains down the line. “They each have the little functions that they do and without one of them the product won’t work in the way that we expect it to.”</p> <p>Abraham should know. A natural resource strategist, he has trekked around the world, from a vast niobium mine in Brazil to an antiquated processing plant in Estonia, investigating how a bunch of exotic-sounding elements have transformed our lives. The upshot is <em>The Elements of Power</em>, a book that explores an epoch Abraham believes to be as profound as those born of stone, iron and bronze: the “rare metal age”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670874a47114d0b5907fbd28b1c86d736aacf99d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/670874a47114d0b5907fbd28b1c86d736aacf99d/0_0_3400_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"rare earth plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rare earth metals plant in China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The name is somewhat misleading. For these elements – a mob that includes indium, lithium and “rare earths” like dysprosium – are not necessarily thin on the ground, although some, such as tellurium, are. “Rare”, Abraham says, comes from the quantities in which they are used: just a dash can transform a material. “Terbium produces more vibrant light in television; dysprosium and neodymium make incredibly strong magnets possible; antinomy helps resists fire,” he writes.</p> <p>Yet, as <em>The Elements of Power</em> reveals, it is a combination of shaky supply chains and shady practices that fuels our hi-tech world. Diplomacy and deals are paramount as deposits and production capabilities vary from country to country – around 85% of the world’s supply of rare earths is provided by China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"guardian science weekly podcast audio\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/94038315&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Guardian’s science weekly podcast discusses rare earth metals.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s a situation that makes Abraham uneasy. After all, to be in the vanguard of technological development, countries need access to rare metals. “ “I’m worried about countries and companies using near monopolistic control to keep prices high or restrict supply of these resources. They already have: China cutting exports is a greater example, but more importantly it showed the supply for rare earths, in this case, is unstable,” he says. Indeed, as the book reveals, such geopolitics are real: China has encouraged foreign companies to set up manufacturing bases there, while in 2010 it halted rare earth exports to Japan in response to a territory dispute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-metals-upgrade-recycle-ethical-china\">Rare earth metals: tech manufacturers must think again, and so must users</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Increasing supply isn’t easy: mines are troublesome, expensive and time-consuming to develop, while a paucity of metallurgists in the west, Abraham says, is cause for concern. Meanwhile our consumption of rare metals is increasing, featuring in everything from bridges to weapons, electric cars to wind turbines. But while their mining, production and even recycling can take a heavy toll, particularly in China. “When we import Kindles, we export pollution, including waste water, carbon dioxide emissions and acid mine drainage,” Abraham writes.</p> <p>Ultimately, <em>The Elements of Power</em> invites readers to reflect on the ramifications of our gadget-filled lives. “Our collective decisions have an impact on places that we haven’t really even thought about. But more importantly, it takes a lot of resources to make the lives we choose,” says Abraham.</p> <p><em>The Elements of Power: Gadgets, Guns, and the Struggle for a Sustainable Future in the Rare Metal Age by David S Abraham is published by Yale University Press, £20</em></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ffpk","wordcount":"554","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c4289f73f2ef4da16c0ff5e72c35e2ce123e8f14/0_0_3400_2040/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-14T07:00:07Z","standfirst":"<p>Rare earths are ubiquitous in our gadgets and have transformed our lives, but sourcing them is costing the environment</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/11/the-elements-of-power-the-rare-earth-metal-age","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/jan/11/the-elements-of-power-the-rare-earth-metal-age","sectionName":"Technology","elements":[{"id":"c4289f73f2ef4da16c0ff5e72c35e2ce123e8f14","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c4289f73f2ef4da16c0ff5e72c35e2ce123e8f14/0_0_3400_2040/2000.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*28063159","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/c4289f73f2ef4da16c0ff5e72c35e2ce123e8f14","suppliersReference":"SIN603","altText":"A worker in a rare-metal smelting workshop in China.","caption":"A worker in a rare-metal smelting workshop in China.

Of course she has ","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In a shadowy corner of the restaurant, Aisling Loftus and I are discussing the strange business of interviews. Loftus isn’t a fan. “As soon as you start talking about acting, you sound like a wanker,” she sighs. “Also, there’s this presumption that if you’re an actor, you like the heightened visibility.” </p> <p>She rubs her forehead worriedly. “I’m not sure I do.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/jan/05/war-and-peace-the-usual-complaints-unabridged\">War and Peace: the usual complaints, unabridged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until now, she was best known to most of us as the face of Agnes Leclair (née Towler) in ITV’s frills-and-tills serial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jan/07/is-mr-selfridge-new-downton-abbey\">Mr Selfridge</a>. Now, with the BBC’s lavish version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/03/war-and-peace-recap-episode-one-costume-drama-bbc1-tolstoy\">Tolstoy’s War and Peace on our screens</a>, visibility is unavoidable.</p> <p>Loftus plays Sonya Rostova, alongside Lily James as Natasha and Gillian Anderson’s socialite Annette; Harvey Weinstein is co-producer. The programme has already made waves for its bodice-ripping sex – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZw8OseGtQ\">lovingly dwelt on in the trailer</a> – and for introducing an incest subplot based on a passing reference in the novel (not wholly surprising, with Andrew Davies behind the adaptation).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22385ea3af0391e9969c13c88accbb7e4e79150b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/22385ea3af0391e9969c13c88accbb7e4e79150b/0_0_2854_4282/667.jpg\" alt=\"Loftus as Sonya in War and Peace.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loftus as Sonya in War and Peace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitch Jenkins/BBC/Mitch Jenkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“You could roll your eyes or say – ach, it’s fun.” Loftus shrugs. “He captures the essence of the book really well. And it suits TV. Long-form storytelling is so much more satisfying. If I’m watching a film and it meanders, that pisses me off. With TV, you really get to know people.”</p> <p>Loftus, now 25, is not altogether dissimilar from her alter ego in Mr Selfridge: the accent is different – native Nottingham rather than Agnes’s chirrupy cockney – but behind the earnest and somewhat hesitant exterior, you can sense the toughness.</p> <p>Acting – or anything approaching it – wasn’t in her background; her mother is a teacher and Nottingham’s Television Workshop provided her first break. Did she always want to do it? “No way. If you say you want to be an actor when you’re 15 or whatever, that’s just precocious, isn’t it?” </p> <p>Wait – didn’t she get her first gig aged nine? “Yeah, OK. A little part in Peak Practice.” She arches an eyebrow. “The golden age of British telly.”</p> <p>She considered drama school, but decided against it after landing the lead in Dominic Savage’s BBC2 two-parter Dive while on study leave for her A-levels: there didn’t seem much point. Loftus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jul/09/dive-tv-review\">won plaudits</a> for her thoughtful portrayal of a schoolgirl swimming champ who is selected for the Olympics, only to discover she is pregnant. That same summer, 2010, she was on stage at the Royal Court in Anya Reiss’s Spur of the Moment, before playing the pocket-sized, catapult-brandishing Arrietty in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/26/tv-review-borrowers-royal-bodyguard\">The Borrowers</a>, also for the BBC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/03/why-war-and-peace-stands-the-test-of-time\">Why War and Peace stands the test of time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sonya has been a tougher prospect. The orphaned, penniless ward of the gilded Rostova family, she falls desperately in love with Natasha’s brother Nikolai (played by Jack Lowden). To his mother’s disgust, Nikolai initially reciprocates before rejecting her for someone more socially appropriate and inviting Sonya to be the governess. </p> <p>Where Tolstoy often seems <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2005/06/12/tolstoy/\">half in love</a> with his vivacious, quixotic heroine Natasha, with Sonya his gaze is clearer, and bleaker. “Sonya really believes that if she’s self-sacrificing, she will be rewarded,” Loftus reflects. “She’ll have this Technicolor romance. We expect that, too, but it isn’t for her. Tolstoy is quite cruel about women sometimes, but he makes an attempt to understand them. At the beginning I think she’s described as a little kitten; at the end she’s a sterile flower.”</p> <p>So she’s read the book? She gives me an expression that reads: durrr! “Of course! Some of the battle scenes are a bit arduous, but I got there. If you’re of a box-set mindset, then it’s the perfect novel, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Her own childhood wasn’t exactly gilded; I wonder what she makes of the argument that actors from working-class backgrounds are being crowded out by rivals with posh vowels – and posher educations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fc30d075d07e82a622ccfec81bf96d5a8a0e27f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7fc30d075d07e82a622ccfec81bf96d5a8a0e27f/0_102_4254_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikolai Rostov (Jack Lowden) moves in on Sonya (Aisling Loftus) .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikolai Rostov (Jack Lowden) moves in on Sonya (Aisling Loftus) .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/BBC/Laurie Sparham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think if you come from privilege you have more confidence. If you don’t, you’d probably be quicker to cut your losses.” She thinks for a few moments. “But then there are other things, aren’t there? My boyfriend [Game of Thrones actor Jacob Anderson] is mixed race, and people keep telling him to be happy because ‘ethnics’ are having a moment. You can’t believe people actually say that! And with female directors, there are still so few. The ones I’ve worked with are great – but they have to be, just to have got there.”</p> <p>After six months dashing between location shoots in Russia and Lithuania for War and Peace, then an autumn in Northern Ireland filming Property of the State, a feature based on the real-life story of an Irish woman trying to defend a brother on trial for murder, Loftus has been doing a fair bit of hustling herself. She’s recently back from LA, doing the rounds of casting directors, and has been burrowing her way into classic Hollywood as research (this morning’s homework: Scorsese’s neglected masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/she-said/2014/mar/28/hollywoods-family-life-airbrushed\">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</a>).</p> <p>Soon we’ll get to watch her in a costume drama of a different stripe: the kickass movie of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/06/pride-prejudice-zombies-grahame-smith\">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</a>, alongside Matt Smith and Lily James. The eyebrow goes up again. “No regrets.”</p> <p>And after that – who knows? “There’s a very real possibility I won’t ever work again,” she says, suddenly hesitant again. “I’m not owed it.” </p> <p><em>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/03/war-and-peace-recap-episode-one-costume-drama-bbc1-tolstoy\">War and Peace is on BBC1 on Sundays at 9pm</a></em></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ftth","wordcount":"915","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/86cbe020c253de45c798b9be1b443b217da93668/0_509_7184_4310/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As the orphaned and penniless ward Sonya in the BBC’s adaptation of War and Peace, Loftus has captured her character’s journey from little kitten to sterile flower.

Fifteen minutes in, I am afraid to say what I am thinking, which is: I am confused. Who are these people? How are they connected? What are they talking about? I am determined not to speak first.</p> <p>“I don’t remember any of this,” my wife says. I nod, and then I think: remember it from when? Something occurs to me.</p> <p>“Have you read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/08/classics.leonikolaevichtolstoy\">War and Peace</a>?” I say.</p> <p>“Of course,” she says. “I skipped all the war bits.”</p> <p>I have not read War and Peace, and I am so unacquainted with the story that I have little idea of what I am missing. I know it concerns (among other things, I’m guessing) the Napoleonic wars, and I know it is long. I have committed it, along with several other titles, to a mental list labelled Great Works to Save For a Future Time When You Are Bedridden.</p> <p>But before episode one is finished, I have decided that I am going to read War and Peace. I imagine myself sitting down to episode two armed with more background than my wife could hope to command. I will answer her befuddled queries by saying: “That is Count So-and-so who, you will no doubt recall, is promised to young Princess Whatshername, though their families are against it.” I will not skip the war bits. I’m not a particularly fast reader, but who cares? I have a whole week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da42aae2395a003fb9b68cdcb787fda6cbea7dca\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/da42aae2395a003fb9b68cdcb787fda6cbea7dca/65_0_1867_2800/667.jpg\" alt=\"It’s a classic …\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s a classic …</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Day one</strong></h2> <p>After scanning our bookshelves in vain the next morning, I approach my wife at her desk.</p> <p>“Do we actually have a copy of War and Peace?” I say.</p> <p>“What for?” she says.</p> <p>“No reason,” I say.</p> <p>“We do somewhere,” she says, turning to stare at the bookshelves behind her. “It’s red and secondhand, and I don’t know when I last saw it. It could be absolutely … Oh, there it is.” She pulls an unassuming old hardback off a high shelf and hands it to me.</p> <p>“This doesn’t look too daunting,” I say, surreptitiously opening it from the back to look at the last page number: 428.</p> <p>“That’s volume one of three,” she says, handing me two more books. I take the stack up to my office, open volume one, skip the introduction and begin reading page one.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, I am still on page one. There is something about the opening – a lengthy, uninterrupted chunk of speech – that will not sink in: “Well, prince, what did I tell you? Genoa and Lucca have become the property of the Bonapartes. Now, I give you fair warning, you will forfeit your position as my friend – as my faithful slave, as you choose to say – if you persist in disbelieving in war, and are still determined to defend all the horrors and atrocities perpetrated by this Antichrist – for that he is Antichrist I am convinced …” There is more, but you get the idea. It takes a bit of nerve, I think, to start a novel with a lengthy quotation from an as yet unidentified speaker, unless you mean to try the reader’s patience from the outset.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f285aefeeaf7b665d4c6dae347f543364ec8d6a0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f285aefeeaf7b665d4c6dae347f543364ec8d6a0/0_0_4080_2449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who are all these people and why do their names keep changing?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who are all these people and why do their names keep changing?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitch Jenkins/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An hour later I am on page 12, and I know the speaker of that opening paragraph to be Anna Paulovna Scherer, aka Gillian Anderson. But that is about all I know. Old familiar questions surface: Who are these people? How are they connected? What are they talking about? After a while I have to put the book down to get on with other things. I can’t just lie about reading all day like some bespectacled Russian aristocrat. When I turn out my bedside light that night, I am on page 23. Just 1,238 pages to go.</p> <h2><strong>Day two</strong></h2> <p>My confusion as to who is whom has subsided but a little. It’s not just that there are so many characters, but that they each have so many names. Along with a first name and a family name, a character may also possess a diminutive, a patronymic, a title and possibly a military rank. They are addressed variously, depending on who they are talking to. So Princess Drubetskaya is Anna Mikhaylovna to her friends. The Rostov family has two Natalias, who both also answer to Natasha, one of whom is also Countess Rostov, or just the Countess.</p> <p>My copy of the book – the 1949 Everyman’s Library edition – makes things worse. A publisher’s note says it is based on the so-called “anonymous” 1886 translation which, I gather, was originally translated into English from a French translation. The main problem is that the names are not rendered in the modern fashion. “Bezukhov” is spelled “Besoukhow”. Prince Vassily is known, from page one, as Prince Basil.</p> <p>Wikipedia offers a fairly comprehensive list of characters, but most descriptions also include a terrible spoiler: “Had an affair with Natasha Rostov”; “later loses an arm”.</p> <p>When it comes to keeping things straight, I find I am entirely reliant on the BBC adaptation. Once I can identify a character as, say, Rebecca Front, I can assign all five of her names to one face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76ed17c5ad62ae5dd842c847c4224d3d794d6e29\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/76ed17c5ad62ae5dd842c847c4224d3d794d6e29/0_141_4291_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gripping … the battle scenes are impossible to skip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gripping … the battle scenes are impossible to skip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Robert Viglasky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read on the tube in the morning. In the afternoon, I fall asleep on the sofa with the book on my face. I finish the day on page 78. So far there have been no war bits to skip.</p> <h2><strong>Day three</strong></h2> <p>I am reliably informed by a colleague who has read War and Peace that I need not bother with Tolstoy’s 100-odd page digression on the nature of freemasonry. That sounds an awfully long way away. After three days I still haven’t covered all the events that occur in episode one of the TV version. But it is always heartening to recognise a scene from the dramatisation: the death of old Count Bezukhov; Andrei Bolkonsky’s leave-taking; giddiness in the Rostov’s drawing room.</p> <p>For the moment, however, I can leave the drawing rooms behind. At last, we are at war. This part is confusing in a whole new way. Titles and ranks are used interchangeably by the narrator. Aide-de-camps gather in shoals in anterooms, one indistinguishable from the other. New characters arrive with every turn of the page. Come on, I keep thinking – let’s get the fighting started, and thin the field out a little.</p> <p>My edition has almost no footnotes, so I read with my phone at my elbow, in case I feel that I need to know what is meant by “a native of Little Russia” (a Ukrainian, basically), but mostly I just push on, blinkered by ignorance. More knowledge would only slow my pace. I am sure it will all make sense in the end.</p> <p>“Are you still reading War and Peace?” says my youngest son, finding me hunched over the book in the kitchen.</p> <p>“What do you mean, still?” I say.</p> <p>“You know it’s on TV, right?”</p> <p>“Yes, that’s the whole … never mind.”</p> <p>I finally put down the book just after midnight, on page 186. The type is tiny, by the way. Did I mention that?</p> <h2><strong>Day four</strong></h2> <p>Battle, when it finally comes, is gripping. I can’t imagine skipping this part. What is commonly referred to as the Fog of War is here, rendered in all its terrifying confusion. Even success on the battlefield happens by accident, when orders are delivered and the battery commanded by Tushin fails to retreat. The experiences of Nicholas Rostov are particularly vivid, because I saw them on TV quite recently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450d0178ddcf306beca28fe01091598bb45b9eb8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/450d0178ddcf306beca28fe01091598bb45b9eb8/0_418_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I’ll get there in the end …\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I’ll get there in the end …</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now I feel I have caught the rhythm of the novel, and developed an instinct for knowing when a character is not going to trouble me again, so I needn’t worry too much about his rank or nickname. I now find myself back in St Petersburg, and I have been away just long enough to forget who everyone is. Some 230 pages in, I realise with a start that Helene Kuragina is actually the daughter of the person I have been calling Prince Basil. I am sure I was meant to know this earlier. When I go back to consult the TV version, I see this was made clear in the first three minutes. Every page I read from now on is uncharted territory, at least until episode two airs.</p> <p>I’m already one sixth of the way through War and Peace; with luck and a fair wind, I figure I can beat the six-part TV adaptation by a week. And when at some point in the future I find myself bedridden, I can just watch old episodes of Celebrity Antiques Road Trip. I will have earned it.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fjzd","wordcount":"1457","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f4bbd8e3e2e5344b4bb8a68da8bc388eac7713ee/0_330_7360_4415/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-13T17:30:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The BBC is screening a lavish adaptation of Tolstoy’s epic novel over six weeks.

It is about three kids named Poppy, Alice and Zach who love playing with dolls. But, the three are in middle school now and Zach’s dad is pushing Zach to join the basketball team and quit girls and dolls.</p> <p>Zach ignores his dad and doesn’t think he will do anything until Zach’s dad throws away all of hid toys and gives Zach no choice. Zach quits playing with dolls but lies about the reason. Poppy and Alice continue playing but are suspicious about the reason Zach quit. Poppy and Alice are happy and continue playing until... </p> <p>Poppy opens her eyes one night and declares that she is having dreams about a girl who is mysteriously murdered and is made into a doll because she is loved so much by her father. The doll desperately wants to be buried. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3134318df5c95efbfe10e3524edc5798406217fe\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3134318df5c95efbfe10e3524edc5798406217fe/0_0_318_467/318.jpg\" alt=\"doll bones\" width=\"318\" height=\"467\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the story of the doll: a few years ago there was a girl named Eleanor Kerchner. Her father was a sculptor. Her father made all sorts of lovely things like vases, but he loved Eleanor most and never wanted to see her die. But, one day Eleanor was mysteriously murdered and Eleanor’s father came to know. He was so sad that he decided that he was going to use her ashes and bones to make a doll representing Eleanor.</p> <p>Poppy’s mum bought the doll years ago and never let anybody touch it. Poppy and her friends were scared of it for a while but they decided to add it to their game to make them less scared. The doll becomes the queen of the game and she sits in her case watching over everything. Now Poppy takes it out and explains everything to Alice. Scared, they both wake Zach up and tell him about it. He agrees to help so long as the girls don’t talk about the reason he quit and they start their journey to East Liverpool, Ohio as this is where the doll prefers to be buried.</p> <p>On the way to East Liverpool, Ohio, they have many adventures but I won’t tell you all. All I will say is ‘Watch out for the crazy man!’. Meanwhile, Alice starts to doubt Poppy and thinks that she made all of this up just to be bossy and to get them to do what she wants. It is only when people think that the doll is an actual person, for example, whenever the three go into a restaurant, the manager asks if they need a table for four people and not three. Alice realises that everything was true and she makes up with Poppy. Spooky isn’t it?! I wonder why this happened to them? Has the doll possessed them with her looks and ash? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/11/cassandra-clare-holly-black-magisterium-the-iron-trial-cowriting\">Why we love writing the epic Magisterium series together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They land up in a library trying to find the place to bury the doll but something or <em>someone </em>takes the doll when they go to sleep and throws it away. The trio look for her in the morning but the librarian finds them and makes them call their parents.</p> <p>Each child talks with their parent and is told to come back home. Only, the three still have sometime. Zach, Alice and Poppy split up to find the doll and Zach finds the doll in a dustbin and takes her back. Poppy is so happy and gives each of them a job. Alice looks for flowers, Poppy to say bye to the doll and Zach digs the grave. </p> <p>Straight after burying the doll, a few honks are heard and the book ends with the three friends walking, relieved, to their cars. The doll won’t trouble them forever now. Or will it?</p> <p>What I like about the book is the spookiness of it all. It made me have goose bumps! I wonder how Holly Black got the inspiration to write a story about a creepy doll. I admire Holly Black – she is such a good writer and I like the language she uses. She really gets the reader involved. She makes some pretty interesting characters too. If you read The Spiderwick Chronicles you’ll see what I mean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

That’s the fate of Antony Carrington, one of the many corpses littering <em>Observer</em> journalist Jamie Doward’s audacious second thriller, which also sees the return of his marathon-running, financial analyst heroine, Kate Pendragon. Having previously been seconded to MI5, Pendragon is now in the pay of Carrington’s former employers, tobacco giants Smith and Webb. But the deceased’s serial slaying is just the start of it: Doward’s chewy plot – black markets, blackmail and a big, fat, satisfyingly diabolical conspiracy – speeds the reader confidently around the globe from Washington DC to Belize to the Sahara, where an arch terrorist is holding US and British energy workers hostage.

appear in the history of comics. He’s wrong","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>This week the largest comics festival in France announced its 30 nominees for what many consider the most prestigious prize in comics, the Grand Prix. Not one nominee was a woman. </p> <p>Usually there are at least few women on the longlist for the Angoulême International Comics Festival (known in French as the <a href=\"http://www.bdangouleme.com/\">Festival international de la bande dessinée</a> or FIBD). Last year’s list included only Marjane Sartrapi. In fact, in the festival’s 43-year history, there has only been one female Grand Prix winner: Florence Cestac, who got the prize in 2000. But this year, there was a swift reaction.</p> <p>First, inspired by the French group <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/angouleme-grand-prix-2016-protest/\">BD Égalité</a>, or Women in Comics Collective Against Sexism, 12 nominees dropped out of consideration, among them Daniel Clowes, Riad Sattouf, Brian Michael Bendis and Chris Ware. FIBD then added six women to the original list of 30 nominees. Then it dropped the list altogether, declaring that academy members could vote for whomever they chose, and the festival would “submit to the absolute free will” of its members. </p> <p>To make matters worse, in a remarkably <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/bande-dessinee/article/2016/01/05/le-festival-de-bd-d-angouleme-accuse-de-sexisme-apres-une-selection-100-masculine_4842193_4420272.html#koYJHbkfuVdxg5XF.99\">tone-deaf interview</a>, the executive officer of the festival, Franck Bondoux, claimed that there was a very simple reason no women were included among the nominees. Discrimination was not to blame, he said. Instead, it was because of a lack of qualified women. “The Festival likes women, but cannot rewrite the history of comics,” he said.</p> <p>Bondoux cited the history of art in support. “If you go to the Louvre,” he said, “you will find few women artists.” </p> <p>Yet the art world knows there are historic reasons for a lack of women in the limited period that the art at the Louvre represents. Women were barred from the academic training that was considered necessary for success. But when you look at the modern artistic landscape, it’s impossible not to see that the art world is <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2016/01/06/saatchi-gallery-to-hold-its-first-all-female-show/?platform=hootsuite\">trying to correct this oversight.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d37fb625cd767ed97ccb91819688abfd801f0064\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d37fb625cd767ed97ccb91819688abfd801f0064/0_154_1987_2981/667.jpg\" alt=\"wonder woman\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drawing of Wonder Woman in Costume, ca 1941.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Metropoliscomics.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“For over 100 years, we have seen the presence of women in the American comics,” Caitlin McGurk, the associate curator of the <a href=\"http://cartoons.osu.edu/\">Billy Ireland Cartoon Library</a> (which houses the largest collection of comics and comic-related history in the world), said. </p> <p>“For the first half of the 20th century, many female cartoonists wrote under ambiguous or masculine names, just to increase their likeliness for publication.”</p> <p>McGurk has many examples: <a href=\"http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1589/\">June Mills</a>, who went by a version of her middle name, “Tarpé”, when she created the great Miss Fury in 1941. Miss Fury, in fact, was the first female action hero created by a woman, predating Wonder Woman.</p> <p>“The early days of the comic strips saw national syndication for artists like Grace Drayton, Rose O’Neill, Nell Brinkley, Ethel Hays, and more who created, published and thrived even under their given name in the first few years of the 1900s,” McGurk continued. </p> <p>She also cited <a href=\"http://cartoons.osu.edu/digital_exhibits/edwinadumm/\">Edwina Dumm</a>, the first female political cartoonist in the United States, who was working long before suffrage had even been extended to women, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Rogers\">Lou Rogers</a>, the art director for Margaret Sanger’s groundbreaking and controversial Birth Control Review.</p> <p>Women were also a substantial presence in the underground comics movement, he said. “How can we dismiss the liberating works of Trina Robbins, Joyce Farmer, Carol Tyler, Roberta Gregory, Diane Noomin?” </p> <p>“And so many who have followed in their footsteps – from Lynda Barry to Phoebe Gloeckner, Marjane Sartrapi and more. These women paved the way for the substantial variety of female cartoonists whom we see working in the field today – their presence is not a token anomaly. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b9d60f4cd950f2321edd27608d5eef16923ee48\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2b9d60f4cd950f2321edd27608d5eef16923ee48/1095_1836_3184_1908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Manga book shop in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Manga bookshop in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“What frightens and disappoints me most about the lack of recognition these women have received, however, is actually the lack of education and historical familiarity present in those who are given the power to bestow such acknowledgements.”</p> <p>Tom Spurgeon, the writer of <a href=\"http://www.comicsreporter.com/\">the Comics Reporter</a> and the executive director of the Cartoon Crossroads Columbus, an American comics festival, certainly disagreed with Bondoux’s pronouncement. </p> <p>“It’s actually very easy to rewrite the history of comics.” Spurgeon said. “It happens all the time. You rewrite history by putting people on these lists. That history failed Angoulême is a terrible, cynical argument to make. The listmakers weren’t even asked to look at history. They were asked to survey the present. Zero for 30 is a dismal reading of the present.”</p> <p>Spurgeon is right. Off the top of my head, I can give you the names of a dozen female comics writers deserving of a lifetime achievement award right now. There are the women of the Japanese manga collective Clamp, whose work ranges from the mythic shojo (girls manga) RG Veda to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga\">seinen manga</a> (adult men’s manga) Chobits. Their output dwarfs all but the most prolific of creators, with their influence seen in comics and cartoons worldwide. </p> <p>There’s also Alison Bechdel, whose 30 years of weekly Dykes To Watch Out For strips stand next to her two bestselling graphic novels, her MacArthur Genius award and the Broadway musical based on her work. </p> <p>And closer to the festival’s home there’s French comics titan Claire Bretécher whose work skewering outdated gender stereotypes has appeared in French humor magazines, in 23 published collections and on French television. (She received a special award from FIBD in 1983, but has never been given the actual Grand Prix.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"765e95608f50190e2f0658339bd12b58aa92112d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/765e95608f50190e2f0658339bd12b58aa92112d/0_0_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Bechdel\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Bechdel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other areas of the comics world have managed to get past attitudes like Bondoux’s. The Eisner Awards, awarded at the San Diego Comic Con since 1988 and often referred to as “the Oscars of the comics industry”, had its first female winner in 1992, when Karen Berger won for her work as editor on Sandman. </p> <p>In fact, many modern comics festivals have fallen over themselves to award female comics creators. Just in the last year, an <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/comics/article/68145-spx-2015-women-cartoonists-sweep-the-ignatz-awards.html\">all-female slate swept the Ignatz awards at the Small Press Expo</a> in Maryland. If anything, the number of female award winners at festivals in the last few years has been overwhelming.</p> <p>In fact the one bright light to this whole affair is that Bondoux’s blind spot to women’s contributions to comics history may end up costing FIBD more than just their reputation. As author Bart Beaty <a href=\"http://www.greatestcomicbook.com/blog/2016/1/6/angoulme-a-ridiculous-embarrassing-debacle\">pointed out</a>, the Grand Prix winner stands for more than just merit. It’s risky for any festival to ignore 50% of the population when it comes to its greatest prize. </p> <p>Even a prestigious festival may have problems attracting a modern audience with such retrograde ideas. To represent the best of comics today, people whose history may have been ignored or discounted needs to be included.

I want you to try and feel what you felt during your worst book hangover. Now, I’m going to tell you mine.<br /></p> <p>As I read my way through the last day of the term before Winter Break, I managed to finish the heart breaking, soul ripping, mind twisting work of fiction titled Glass Sword. As I looked up at my best friend, I had this expression of bewilderment on my face – like I couldn’t place where I was. Because for me, and even in my dreams later that night, I was no longer living in Chennai, India, but in Norta – with Mare Barrow. No, as Mare Barrow, the lightning girl. The Red Queen.</p> <p>For every hour of the aforementioned night, I woke up, gasping. The first time, I was running out of a burning building that was collapsing on itself. The second time, I had escaped a war zone and I was just breathing in a sigh of relief, while staring at the red blood and dirt on my hands. As I woke up, I remember thinking ‘Wait, that’s not silver blood.’</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ecd5c04245ff17a851a55242f87e63f24ffe16c2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ecd5c04245ff17a851a55242f87e63f24ffe16c2/0_0_540_810/333.jpg\" alt=\"Glass Sword\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you don’t get it yet, reading Victoria Aveyard’s Glass Sword made me dream or rather, create my own, albeit distorted, version of a rebellion. Victoria Aveyard’s Glass Sword had me recreating everything I’d just read and felt, only this time, visually in my head. </p> <p>Glass Sword made me truly believe that I was living in a world where I had to fight with weapons and wit, where anyone can betray anyone and one where I could either kneel or bleed. </p> <p>When I opened the book yesterday morning, I found myself back at exactly where I put it down – six months ago in my world, but just a few hours later in Mare’s. I was quite literally back on the train that Mare woke up to find herself in: with Cal, Kilorn, Farley and all the other members of the Scarlet Guard. Nothing had changed, but me. Finally returning after what seems like a VERY long and rather tiring game of involuntarily hitting the snooze button.<br /></p> <p>On the run from unmentionable things, because if you haven’t read Red Queen, then I’m not going to be the one to ruin it for you, Mare finds herself for the first time, seeing the Scarlet Guard for what it is, but more importantly, trying to figure who she is, and who she has to be. Mare Barrow or Mareena or the unforgivable lightning girl? Something deadly and alone, or someone weak and defeated?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because Mare Is Red, and Silver, but stronger than both – and she’s not the only one. She has a list. A whole list of people just like her, all of whom are on top of the King’s hit list. And if she wants to stand a chance against him; if she wants change for the Reds and fairness to all, she has to find them. First.</p> <p>But the Silver King and his leash holder are forces to be reckoned with, and Mare is just one girl. Mare is a Glass Sword, and one that’s beginning to crack. Needless to say, I loved Glass Sword, and everything it had to offer me. I’m going to be crying for a year until I receive book three, but put in your pre-orders, because this is not a book you want to miss.</p> <p>Victoria Aveyard, I salute you. And I thank you for that brilliant experience.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/375824/\">Guardian

flavour and disposition of the times led to the idea of a “Beattie generation”; decades later, what makes her so influential is still clear. The 15 stories in this collection, her first in a decade, are centred on Maine, tucked high up in America’s north-eastern corner, home to affluent coast dwellers and host to all manner of visitors. In Beattie’s understated but powerful vignettes, “time-warp hippies cross paths with people who live in brownstones and don’t have to think about money”; a bored teenager is dispatched to stay with her aunt and uncle and rebels by streaking her hair pink; a writer comes to quiz an elderly woman about her experiences of Truman Capote and Robert Lowell.

Jonas Karlsson’s latest novella is issued with a staggering invoice for his life to date. His debt has been calculated by the Orwellian World Resources Department according to his “Experienced Happiness” score, but when he rings the helpline to correct the error he inadvertently makes matters worse; as his contentment with his few possessions, shabby flat and dead-end job are revealed, WRD’s mysterious “calculations” multiply the amount owed to the point of absurdity, while also eliciting the sympathy of its surprisingly tender-hearted representative, Maud.</p> <p><em>The Invoice</em> is a gentle satire on materialism and spiralling global debt, and while Karlsson’s central conceit does not stand up to much scrutiny, his modern-day fable is nonetheless entertaining, thought-provoking and delivered with a good humour that makes it hard to resent its irrepressible hero.</p> <p><em>The Invoice is published by Hogarth (£9.99). </em><a

parents","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Shortly before Christmas, the journalist <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/profile/David-Aaronovitch\">David Aaronovitch</a>, who has sometimes struggled with his weight, agreed to appear on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06rzd46\">Radio 4’s <em>Woman’s Hour</em></a><em> </em>with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/20/katie-hopkins-sun-migrants-article-petition-nears-180000-mark\">Katie Hopkins</a>, the <em>Mail Online </em>columnist whose pet subject is her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/katie-hopkins-apprentice-fat-shaming\">loathing of fat people</a>. For listeners, the debate that followed was predictably unedifying: the day we learn anything from Hopkins is the day we don our skates to scoot across the frozen expanses of hell. But Aaronovitch, transfixed by his opponent’s “self-hatred, her horror of loss of control”, found it fascinating. Afterwards, far from trying to forget all about their encounter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daaronovitch/status/677444500860612610\">he pointed this out to her on Twitter</a>, the social network on which he perhaps spends just a little too much of his time.</p> <p>Personally, I remain uncertain of Hopkins’s self-hatred, and its capacity to fascinate. But I do know one thing, which is that this story tells us more about him than it does about her. Leaving aside his insight into her inner engine – born, perhaps, of the years he spent in psychoanalysis – it reveals above all his deep and near-constant need to be heard. Clever, busy and successful, you might imagine that he would have better things to do with his time than bang his head against a brick wall in a BBC studio. But, no. Not only is he up for such futile altercations, he enjoys them to the degree that he sometimes likes to prolong them via the internet.</p> <p>Where does it come from, this necessity for argument? Of course, it’s useful to him: it’s how he makes his living. (Far from ever being stuck for a subject for his <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/profile/David-Aaronovitch\">column in the <em>Times</em></a>, he tells me proudly, he usually arrives at his desk with no fewer than three ideas.) But isn’t it wearying? Doesn’t it have any ill effects on his soul? Above the barking of his terrier, Dora, to whom he is, for the purposes of my tape recorder, rather annoyingly devoted, Aaronovitch insists, for the second time this morning, that the answer to both these last questions is “no”. As to the first, although he hates to be referred to as a contrarian – he would never take up a position just for the hell of it – he is well aware of his own engine, which manifests itself in what he calls “defensive clarification”. It’s a tendency he can trace back to his childhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25e5569a1683ce4fa886d698419075d9589c3d2e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/25e5569a1683ce4fa886d698419075d9589c3d2e/47_59_941_1362/691.jpg\" alt=\"David Aaronovitch at home in 1976.\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Aaronovitch at home in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy David Aaronovitch/Penguin-Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“One of the things I grew up feeling was an intense need to explain myself. I have to try, somehow, to lift myself beyond other people’s negative assessments of me.” So why go around disagreeing with people all the time? “Yes… Well, I guess I tend to proceed through self-provocation. I get myself out of a slough that might lead to a depression by making myself do things [that I don’t really want to do].”</p> <p>Aaronovitch’s childhood, singular and rather bleak, is laid bare in his extraordinary new memoir-cum-social history, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/30/party-animals-my-family-other-communists-review-david-aaronovitch-marxism\"><em>Party Animals</em></a>, which tells the story of his parents and their enduring love affair, not with each other, but with the Communist party of Great Britain. It is quite an honest book, and a surprisingly measured one, all things considered. But it is also, surely, another of the self-provocations to which he has just referred. In his world, deadlines are as frequent and as commonplace as breakfast; he should have been able to bash through the writing of it as if through a meringue. Yet it took him a decade. “Doing the personal bits took some goading,” he says. “One of my friends, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/02/john-lahr-people-new-yorker-critic-life-theatre\">John Lahr</a> [the biographer of Joe Orton and Tennessee Williams], was always saying to me: the bit that’s the most difficult to write, the bit that makes you wince – that’s the thing you really should say. I think that’s broadly right.” Did it feel transgressive to be writing about his parents? “If you mean: do I feel guilty about the fact that the reader’s takeaway impression of them might not be one they would have wanted people to have in perpetuity? Yes, is the answer.</p> <p>“But then, you know that old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/06/janet-malcolm-a-life-in-writing\">Janet Malcolm</a> thing that writers are betrayers ever.” He gives me a meaningful look. “It’s what we do, isn’t it?”</p> <p>It’s bewildering to remember that he grew up only a short distance from the huge Victorian house high on a Hampstead hill – in 2016, this is plutocrat central – in which we’re now sitting (he shares it with his wife and three daughters). From this vantage point, his beginnings, complicated and unhappy, seem to belong to another world. Aaronovitch’s father, Sam, was the son of Jewish immigrants who’d grown up in grinding poverty in east London (Sam’s father, Morris, did piecework repairing buttonholes, and the family, five strong, shared two rooms in a terrace just off Cable Street).</p> <p>His mother, Lavender, by contrast, was the middle-class daughter of Worcestershire industrialists. However, by the time they met in 1951 – they were married in January 1954, and David was born that July – both had something of a past. Sam, who’d been married twice before, had a daughter, Frances, by his second wife. Lavender, meanwhile, was alone in the world – her widowed father had rejected her, having begun a new family elsewhere – save for the daughter, Sabrina, she had conceived towards the end of the war (she would be brought up as Sam’s).</p> <p>For both of them, you sense, communism rushed in to fill an emotional space, as well as an intellectual/political one. Sam, autodidact, ambitious and desperate to escape his roots, had joined the Stepney branch of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Communist_League_%28Great_Britain%29\">Young Communist League</a> in 1934, at the age of 14, motivated by “hatred of fascism … of capitalists who had squeezed the blood out of my father and made Stepney the slum it is”. In the years since, he had slowly worked his way up the organisation, and by 1954, was its (full-time, salaried) cultural secretary – a job that earned him, thinly disguised, a walk-on part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/the-golden-notebook-50-years-on\">Doris Lessing’s <em>The Golden Notebook</em></a>.</p> <p>What about Lavender? For years, Aaronovitch assumed that his mother owed her politics to the influence of his father. In fact, this was not the case. She joined the Communist party of her own volition, shortly after becoming a homeowner in 1948 (her uncle helped her to buy the house, a 1920s semi near Parliament Hill Fields, in which Aaronovitch lived until he went to university). It isn’t clear why, exactly, she did this, but from here on, her commitment to the cause would be even more absolute than that of her future husband. In <em>Party Animals</em>, her son includes a selection of entries from her diary of 1963. They make for rather comical reading. “Went to Sam’s class on surplus value,” says the one for 13 June. “Very good, exhilarating to see light dawn on new members re profit etc!!” Life was one long round of demos, jumble sales and frosty mornings spent selling the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star_%28British_newspaper%29\"><em>Daily Worker</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e264420d1e96dba98872a3c8b79e143441dc9cd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0e264420d1e96dba98872a3c8b79e143441dc9cd/30_35_1248_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Aaronovitch with the infant David in 1954\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Aaronovitch with the infant David in 1954.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did all this mean for the boy David? (Sam and Lavender would go on to have two more sons together – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Aaronovitch\">Ben</a>, now a writer of supernatural crime novels, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Aaronovitch\">Owen</a>, an actor). “I wasn’t indoctrinated,” he says. “It was just there. It was like growing up in a Catholic family, or a Muslim one, only we were communists.” All the same, his family existed at a right angle – or perhaps I mean a left angle – to the rest of the world; they lived in a state of “complete otherness”. Some of what went on is, I suppose, wholly predictable: the fact, for instance, that his family was never to be heard moaning about strikes, for the simple reason that it was all in favour of strikes. But the isolation was near-total – the Aaronovitchs only associated with other communists – and for a child of school age, life involved a certain amount of deprivation. Unlike his friends, David was not allowed to read the <em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2013/jun/10/beano-top-20-book-covers\">Beano</a> </em>because its publisher, DC Thomson, was non-union. Walt Disney (anti-union, anti-communist and allegedly anti-black) movies were also forbidden. In place of the Cubs (royalist) he had Socialist Sunday School, at which the hours were mostly spent writing plays with anti-fascist themes (one year, he got to play a Nazi general). The family finances were, moreover, parlous. “We’d no bloody money,” says Aaronovitch. “We were the poorest people we knew.” On one occasion, his mother made the family loaf last four days. On another, out of money for coal, she sat around in her dead aunt’s fur coat. Intellectually, the family was rich, in as much as the house was full of Sam’s big, if inflexible, ideas (also, his parents’ collection of books). But in every other sense, it sounds to have been utterly joyless.</p> <p>His parents were ascetic, difficult, and self-absorbed. His father disliked small children, and longed in the evenings only to be shut in his study (Sam would miraculously go on to read for a DPhil at Oxford, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/26/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Christopher Hill</a>, the master of Balliol and a fellow communist). His mother, meanwhile, felt thwarted, stuck at home. She was, says David, “a classic person who’d had an exciting war” and thereafter felt the walls closing in on her. She and her oldest son had a particularly bad relationship. “She said I’d had a character change at the age of two, and that after that she didn’t like me much. She preferred my brother, who was softer, more pliable; I was famously and absurdly articulate, and always arguing, and I suppose that was annoying.” It is his mother that he blames for his need always to argue, explain, justify. “She would tell you that something hadn’t happened that you both patently knew had happened. When you’re a child, that really fucks with your head.”</p> <p>His mother prized fidelity above all else. If you had committed to somebody or something, then you had to stand by them until “death or a party congress changed the situation”. As David got older, this made his life difficult. He was not allowed to fall out with friends, or to split up with girlfriends. “She was disapproving when I grew my hair long,” he writes, “and even more disapproving when, a few years later, I cut it again. I had, in a sense, let my own hair down.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My father’s file has never been released, but I suspect the worst of it was just an unrelenting late 40s Stalinism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, she would never take her son’s side. She might defend him behind his back, but to his face, she was only ever cross, disapproving.</p> <p>Perhaps, though, she only behaved like this because she was unhappy. Aaronovitch has come to realise that one of the themes of his book is denial: “Increasingly, I realised that there are parallels between the way people think and feel about politics, and the way they think and feel about other things.” Overinvest emotionally in a cause, just as in a person, and the same certain terrible blindness may arise. Having thought of their marriage as year zero – at home, Aaronovitch never once heard his mother mention Frances, his father’s daughter, and he did not meet his half-sister until he was in his 30s – Lavender could not countenance the fact that her project had failed and she might be about to join the ranks of Sam’s exes.</p> <p>The only problem with this was the evidence of what was happening right under her nose. In one of the most appallingly memorable scenes in the book – fast forward to the 70s – Lavender rushes from her bedroom in the middle of the night, clad only in her nightie. Parked a little way from the house is the trusty Aaronovitch family van, inside which, it seems, is Sam and another woman. Not too long after this, they finally split up.</p> <p>Pondering his mother’s failure hitherto to get to grips with his father’s behaviour (this was by no means the first time Sam had misbehaved), and later with his own admission to his shrink that, no, he had had no idea at all what was going when he was a teenager, something falls into place for Aaronovitch. He thinks of the way that his mother stuck with the party – even, say, after 1956, when Russian tanks rolled into Prague – and it occurs to him that it is no good asking what those communists who were active in Britain between the late 30s and the 60s would have done “if they had known” about the millions of people who had been quietly and not so quietly murdered in Russia by Stalin and co. The questions one really needs to ask, unacademic as they are, go more like this: “How could you not have known?” and “How did you manage not to know?” and “Why did you choose not to know?” More complicatedly, the states of knowing and not-knowing can coexist.</p> <p>“If we take the show trials [which took place in eastern Europe between 1948 and 1953] and people’s defence of them here [the British Communist party’s line was that, with these executions, the Soviet government had nipped a conspiracy in the bud], there is knowing, and not knowing.” This, he thinks, is a very extreme example of the confirmation bias we see at work everyday in ourselves, and everyone we know. “One of the things that fascinates me is listening to people who are big supporters of Corbyn. They have invested in the desire for him to succeed so heavily, they are in no position to question anything he does.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c244f91c64b9ace3ab253d08f275488d06cb99f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c244f91c64b9ace3ab253d08f275488d06cb99f/77_77_908_1330/683.jpg\" alt=\"Sam and Lavender Aaronovitch, 1968\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David’s parents, Sam and Lavender Aaronovitch, in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy David Aaronovitch/Penguin-Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about Sam? In <em>Party Animals</em>, he writes that while he never once saw his father cry, Sam is said to have wept when Stalin died in 1953. “And so did millions of people. This is the thing we are reluctant to get about dictatorships.” In the book, reading MI5 and Special Branch files in the National Archives, he discovers that a member of his parents’ circle was a Soviet spy: “heavy-duty treachery from a woman we saw at all the party bazaars!” he says, half-delightedly. But he thinks Lavender and Sam would have done exactly the same had they been in any position to. “My father’s file has never been released, but I suspect the worst of it was just an unrelenting late-40s Stalinism, complete with all the lies and distortions.</p> <p>“Still, they would have thought it was their job to help preserve the workers’ state in the face of the attacks on it from fascism and the forces of international capitalism.” As a teenager, however, it wasn’t his parent’s unyielding politics that pushed him away from them (though he still seems furiously resentful about his comprehensive school education); he simply didn’t get on with them. Having travelled to Bulgaria alone at the age of 12 – in Sofia, he was billeted with socialist aristocracy – he refused thereafter to holiday with what he thought of then as his “lousy, fucking, bastard” parents. His behaviour grew so tricky, his teachers called in a therapist: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/28/guardianobituaries.booksonhealth\">Robin Skynner</a>, who’d go on to write a book about family life with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-cleese\">John Cleese</a>.</p> <p>His move away from their communism took more time. Having been sent down from Oxford after failing an exam, he arrived at the University of Manchester, where he fell for the women’s movement, and lived in digs where free love, or something a little like it, was practised by his landlady. “At 18, I was a Corbynite,” he says. “At 39, I wasn’t.” What changed him? “It was being in the National Union of Students and having to deal with real stuff. At 22, I was vice-president of services, and a month later NUS Travel collapsed, and I was having to deal with redundancies. It was a hard lot of pragmatism. The world was not like I thought it was. Then, just before I became president, Thatcher was elected. Operating assumptions about the world were completely shattered. Two years later, not one ideological brick was left standing.” He finally left the CP in 1987, when he began working as a journalist at the BBC. When he told Lavender, her sense of betrayal was so overwhelming, he reversed his Ford Escort into a Porsche – a bit of symbolism that might have come straight out of a bad novel. Four years later, the Communist party of Great Britain was dissolved.</p> <p>His politics now are not, of course, without controversy. The left regards him as a Blairite apologist, while his readers at the <em>Times</em> doubtless regard him as a crazed lefty. Either way, he’s depressed about what has happened to Labour since the election – and he feels guilty about it. “I feel guilty that there seemed to be no exciting or realistic thing on offer to the people who voted for Corbyn. It was our generation’s job to provide that. Why wasn’t it possible for people like me to help elucidate a prospectus that would have been attractive?”</p> <p>For all that he may be somewhat overestimating the power and public estimation of newspaper opinion writers, he sounds chastened. Then again, the other night, there he was, debating on <em>Newsnight </em>the bombing of Syria. Given what happened with Iraq – he was very vocally in favour of the war there – you’d have thought he’d be tempted to stay out of this one. Wasn’t he worried his mere presence might have made the undecided come down against another foreign adventure? “It’s interesting you say that. I only looked at it from the point of view that [getting involved] would be so exhausting. It shows I’m an arrogant git, really.”</p> <p>Human beings are all, in almost equal measure, self-aware and self-deluding. But in Aaronovitch, this tendency does seem marked – though perhaps his book, which makes such a virtue of unpicking his parents’ terrible misapprehensions, has also made me more alert to it. It’s rather amazing, for instance, to discover that his siblings have seen no advance copy. “You’ve made me worry now,” he says, when I ask if this doesn’t mean he is dreading publication (every child believes their version of their parents is the true version). And then: “You can interpret it quite aggressively, which is that this is my attempt to take their parents away from them. But I didn’t want to invite a problem that didn’t exist. I didn’t want to shove it at them, making myself the centre of what they’re doing, when actually, they’ve got other things to do. None of them likes to be reflective about this in the way that I do. They regard it as psychobabble, and I don’t.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But equally, thanks both to his personality and, possibly, to his analysis – into which he went at the suggestion of another pal, the best-selling shrink <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/25/examined-life-stephen-grosz-review\">Stephen Grosz</a> – he is brilliant to talk to. He could go on all day and, up to a point, I’d be happy to listen. Does he feel better now he’s finished his book, more complete?</p> <p>“Yes. Definitely.” His parents’ unhappiness took its effect on all their children and, in turn, he used to have “a fair capacity” for making himself and other people miserable. But this is behind him now. He feels “comfortable about who I am”.</p> <p>This isn’t to say, however, that he has been able completely to draw a line under their politics, to mark their file “solved”. He wrote <em>Party Animals</em>, in part, to answer those of his friends on the right – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/24/osborne-hague-baron-finkelstein-pinner-danny\">Daniel Finkelstein</a>, the Tory peer, being one – who cannot get their heads around the ugly chasm between belief and outcome in the case of communism (or understand why unrepentant supporters of communism never received the same kind of condemnation that, say, an unrepentant supporter of National Socialism might have had). But I wonder if those people will be satisfied. As I read, I cheered Sam and Lavender’s “obstinate heroism” in the matter of, say, fighting apartheid. I was even able to forgive them their refusal to allow little David ever to pick up the <em>Beano</em>. But after 300 pages of intense examination on their son’s part – his book is so vivid and moving – I still can’t understand why they never arrived at a moment of reckoning, a sense that it was their moral duty to renounce a cause that had brought with it such appalling human suffering. Some people are able to give up on each other more easily than they are to shake off their muddled, iron-bound convictions. But coming to this realisation isn’t, in the end, much of an epiphany.</p> <p><em>Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists is published by Jonathan Cape, £17.99. </em><a

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
