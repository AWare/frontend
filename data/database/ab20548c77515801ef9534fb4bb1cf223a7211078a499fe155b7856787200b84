This gives it a&nbsp;familiar feel: of a Western European, weekend break, cultural-tick-box city. But, although it can remind you of Amsterdam, of Berlin, of Brussels, it's not really like any of those places. Because St Petersburg is in Russia.</p><p>Russia! My mum and I don fake-fur hats and pose outside the Winter Palace of Peter I. There is no snow and the sky is the colour of Tupperware. It is perishing. Weary-looking horses stand in front of golden carriages, puffa-wrapped schoolchildren cluster and bump like tethered balloons, men in khaki army uniforms stride about, young and raw-jawed. Behind them glitters the Barbie mansion that is the Winter Palace. It links into other  palaces that make up the Hermitage museum, stretched along the bank of the River Neva. By December the river will be frozen and won't thaw until April.</p><p>My mum has been to St Petersburg before: in 1981, when was she was a teacher in Manchester, she took a group of schoolgirls. \"Everyone kept wanting to buy our jeans and coats,\" she remembers. \"And we went to a circus. That had <em>vultures!</em>\" Before that, in the summer of 1965, she and my dad <em>drove</em> to St Petersburg, in a Mini. They went via Finland. I really can't believe that they did this, but there are  photographs.</p><p>The main difference between 1965  St Petersburg and the city of 46 years later is, says Mum, the lack of cars. Back then, people formed crowds around the Mini, and ooh-ed and aah-ed over its transverse engine; during the communist years, no foreign cars were imported into Russia. Now, Ford, GM and Toyota all have factories close to St Petersburg and the centre sometimes locks into a static traffic jam.</p><p>Also, she says, in 1965, \"there were no signs\". In order to do anything – visit sites, check into a hotel, change money, get petrol tokens – they had to get authorisation from the In-Tourist office. They had the address, but couldn't find it and had to beg a sailor, who understood a&nbsp;little English, to take them to the door. When they got there, it was entirely anonymous. No plaque, no display, no indication from the  outside that there was anything non-domestic  within.</p><p>Now, St Petersburg has plenty of signs. Not that we can read them, of course, though some words are easy to guess: KOPE for coffee. PECTOPAH means restaurant, says my mum, and we go to a&nbsp;Ukrainian one, where the waiters wear billowing silk trousers and everyone smokes. I ask for a vodka and tonic, and the waiter is genuinely puzzled. He brings me a glass of vodka, to be knocked back in one go, and a bottle of tonic for afters.</p><p>His trousers are fancy. Ours are not. Not one person asks us if they can buy them. This is because there are clothes shops everywhere and because our trousers are not desirable. Today's Russian woman is tall and gorgeous and dressed like a Selfridges Christmas tree. There is no part of her clothing that is plain: everything is stonewashed, or appliquéd, or has diamanté dangly bits, or is made out of actual leopard. Heels are killer. Make-up can be viewed at 100 paces. Our trousers – and us – are just too dull.</p><p>I wonder where these Swarovski-studded glamazons go when they hit 35. Because it appears that they are kidnapped and swapped for small, stout, grumpy lady trolls. After a&nbsp;while, I realise all Russian women contain within their DNA both ravishing supermodels and Rosa Klebb – like St Petersburg; like Russia itself. On the way from the airport, we passed mile upon mile of concrete housing blocks:  relics of the Communist era and still the places most locals live. And yet, in the city centre, all is a Big Fat Gypsy Architect's wet dream.</p><p>With our tour guide, Natasha, we whizz around the city: go to the square that commemorates the Decemberists (nobles who died because they believed in the emancipation of serfs); the Church of the Spilt Blood where Alexander II was mortally wounded. And we visit St Peter and Paul's Fortress on an island opposite The Hermitage, a prime example of the Russian supermodel/Klebb combination.</p><p>First up, the cathedral in the centre, an imperious feast of gold and mosaic which contains the tombs of all the Romanov emperors and empresses from Peter the Great until the very last, Nicholas II. Peter the Great, the city's namesake, was a redoubtable dude. Standing 6ft 8in, in a time when most people struggled to get over 5ft 6in, he became Tsar at 10 and founded St Petersburg in 1703, when he was 28. He learned about city planning in Manchester, shipbuilding in Amsterdam and paid for European architects, artists and artisans to come and create his vision of a city: the vision that still brings in the visitors of today. St Petersburg has a population of 4.5m, but  5.5m tourists visit each year.</p><p>Peter the Great himself was skilled in various professions, including dentistry, though he is mostly remembered for his shipbuilding. He would go to the shipyards himself, often after a heavy night's drinking and two hours' sleep, and teach the locals. He was modern-thinking, changing the clock to European time, making his courtiers shave their beards off and encouraging the population to come to Russia's first-ever museum, not far from here. The museum housed a display of deformed embryos brought back by him from Holland, and Peter offered a drink and a pastry on entrance. Free cake and booze. There's an emperor who understood his subjects.</p><p>After Peter, the ruling Romanovs were, variously, vicious two-faced modernisers or vicious two-faced conservatives. Their tombs are in rows inside the cathedral: gilded, immovable. At a certain point, a law was passed banning females from the throne because they caused too much trouble. The final Tsar was Nicholas II, who was married to Alix, grand-daughter of Queen Victoria. Their tombs are in a separate room, at the back, away from the altar. They were murdered in 1917 on the orders of Lenin, their bodies and those of their five children thrown down a disused mine. Only in 2008 were the last two corpses found and identified by DNA samples. Natasha shrugs when she tells us this. \"It is sad, yes,\" she says. \"But  I think worse for the ordinary Soviet people who lost their children to war or starvation.\"</p><p>Natasha is 28 and pragmatic. She thinks some aspects of Communist Russia were good. Education, for example. Everyone in the country could read and write. But now, Putin has announced literacy is too high, because there is no one willing to sweep the streets (other than immigrants). So he's proposing that parents pay for all their children's lessons other than the basics. This, and the fact that you have to pay for childcare, is putting Natasha off becoming a mother.</p><p>Also, she explains, when Communism collapsed, it was decreed that private property was the way forward. Thus, everyone was deemed to be an owner of their flat (previously rented from the state). That's everyone who lived there, including children from the age of 16. Natasha lives with her husband, his mum and grandmother. Four adults, all property owners. But none of them can sell, because of everyone else's claims. There's no room for kids.</p><p>Natasha leads us to another part of the  St Peter and Paul's Fortress: the political remand prison. Dostoevsky was imprisoned in the original jail, demolished in the late 1800s and replaced with the one we walk around. We poke our heads into dark, individual cells: Trotsky, Gorky, Lenin's brother all spent time here. The prison was carefully designed so that no prisoner ever encountered another; the identities of those incarcerated were even kept from the guards. No communication was allowed, though prisoners tapped messages to each other. The last one left in 1921.</p><p>In the evening, we go to the circus. Natasha says: \"I would not allow you to go to a private circus. The animals are badly treated there, and I do not like it. There is a state circus  in every city in Russia and all the animals  are treated well. There is a cat theatre in  Moscow. I love cats.\"</p><p>It's half-term, and we take our seats among hundreds of children. And we sit through – no, be honest, we enjoy – two hours of unbelievable entertainment. Goats that trot up and down stairs. Cats that stand on the back of dogs. Monkeys that ride bicycles, bears that do handstands, sea lions that play football, ostriches that, um, run around a bit. It is utterly mesmerising. My animal morals take a thrashing. It is hard to resist clapping a sea lion when it's clapping at you. It is even harder not to love a monkey in a&nbsp;bowtie and waistcoat.</p><p>When I was young, I was obsessed by gymnastics. My heroine was Olga Korbut, the first woman to do a standing back somersault on the balance beam. She was enchanting: thoroughly charming, astonishingly gifted, a crowd-pleaser. She was also being abused by her coach. And she's what I think about when I watch the circus in St Petersburg. I&nbsp;ask my mum if she enjoyed it. \"Yes,\" she says. \"No vultures, dear. A definite improvement.\"</p><p>We leave, and go into the cold night. Everyone is smiling, and well wrapped-up. The city is stunning and there's so much more to see.</p><h2>Essentials<br /></h2><p>Miranda Sawyer and  her mother travelled with Baltic Holidays.

Locals continue to discuss the merits of the recent restoration, but judge for yourself – walk among the 18th-century marble statues and tree-lined alleys before the fountains are turned off for the winter.</p><p>The gardens are managed by the nearby Russian Museum, and can be accessed either from the ornate wrought-iron gates running along the Dvortsovaya embankment of the Neva, or from the entrance on ulitsa Pestelya, close to whether the Moika and Fontanka rivers meet. <br />• <a href=\"http://www.rusmuseum.ru/eng/info/\" title=\"\"><em>rusmuseum.ru/eng/info</em></a><em>, free entrance, closed Tuesdays</em></p><h2>Imperial Porcelain Factory</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399026914'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/7/1352284256580/Russian-imperial-porcelai-008.jpg' alt='Russian imperial porcelain tea set' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph:  L A Heusinkveld/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>For many years St Petersburg was one of Europe's great centres for the production of porcelain. The Imperial Porcelain Factory, founded in 1744, was just one of a number of manufacturers in the city producing bespoke high-quality crockery, ornaments and decorative pieces for the fabulously wealthy aristocrats and merchants who lived here. Renamed the Lomonosov factory by the Soviets, the company has now reverted to its original name and set up a number of franchise locations across the city selling exquisite gifts and dinner sets in pre-Revolutionary, Soviet-themed and contemporary artistic designs. <br />• <em>Prospekt Obukhovskoy oborony, 151, +7 812 326 1744, </em><a href=\"http://www.ipm.ru/\" title=\"\"><em>ipm.ru</em></a><em> (Russian-language only), factory tours can be arranged in advance at the main manufacturing site, £15pp for a group of five</em></p><h2>Erarta Contemporary Art Museum and Gallery</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399026915'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/7/1352284341936/Erarta-contemporary-art-g-010.jpg' alt='Erarta contemporary art gallery, St Petersburg, Russia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Not many people think of visiting St Petersburg for its contemporary art scene, but that is changing fast with a number of extraordinary new venues springing up around the city. <a href=\"http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html\" title=\"\">The Hermitage</a> is opening a contemporary art wing in 2014, but in the meantime be sure to check out the Erarta on Vasilievsky ostrov (Basil's Island) on the north bank of the Neva.&nbsp; It's the country's largest non-governmental collection of contemporary art. <br />• <em>29th Liniya, 2 Vasilievksy ostrov, + 7 812 324 08 09, </em><a href=\"http://www.erarta.ru/eng/\" title=\"\"><em>erarta.ru/eng</em></a><em>, £6, various discounts available.

This small two-roomed cafe has been serving greasy and filling doughnuts (known locally as pyshky) to the proletariat for almost half a century, and is a real taste of nostalgia for the millions of Soviet-era visitors who flocked here in droves. Although there have been some superficial improvements to the décor, the high tables have been retained, the same crockery is used, the atmosphere is utilitarian Soviet, the prices are still very modest, but most importantly the recipes for crunchy doughnuts sprinkled with icing sugar and accompanied by milky coffee are the same. <br />• <em>Bolshaya konushennaya ulitsa, 25, + 7 812 314 0868, no website, open daily from 9am-8pm, 20p for a pyshky, 30p for milky coffee or tea with sugar</em></p><h2>SupVino restaurant</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399026917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/7/1352285182781/SupVino-restaurant-St-Pet-010.jpg' alt='SupVino restaurant, St Petersburg' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Blink and you miss it, but this tiny restaurant on Kazanskaya ulitsa is that rare thing – warm and welcoming on a cold winter's day, cool and dark on a hot summer's day. With just 20 stools across five high tables and a bar, the large mirrors on either wall and window on to the street make it feel bigger than it is. Mercifully it's non-smoking, given the dimensions. As the name suggests, soup and wine are the specialities here, but you can also get other light dishes.

But that's just what local jazz ensemble Billy's Band have done. A large wrap-around bar, a few tables around the edges, an above-bar mezzanine area and large windows looking on to the street, and a small stage, where every night a small combo – usually piano, bass, trumpet, drums – performs some swinging sets based on classic American 20th-century standards.

While Russia's former capital has always had the looks, its personality has been, at best, enigmatic and, at worst, dull. But now, characterful creative spaces and cafes serving top-notch street food are giving the city some edge. Ground zero for this transformation is the strip of land between the rivers Moyka and Neva. Recently rejuvenated by the new metro station at Admiralteyskaya, the area – also home to big-hitters like the Hermitage museum – is easy to explore on foot and a perfect introduction to the future of St Petersburg.</p><p>Set yourself up for a day in the snow with brunch at <a href=\"http://22-13.com/legend\" title=\"\"><strong>22.13</strong></a>  (Konushennaya ploshad 2) <strong>1</strong>, a local favourite that hides its past as a taxi garage with a beautiful arched ceiling, spiral staircase and vintage furniture from Paris.

The cosy <strong>Bistro Dekabrist</strong> (Yakubovicha Street 2) <strong>11</strong>, serves great burgers (on wooden slabs), plus a good selection of beers and ciders (still a rarity in the city).  <a href=\"http://mayakovskybar.su/en/\" title=\"\"><strong>Mayakovsky</strong></a> (Pochtamptskiy Pereulok 5) <strong>12</strong>, is the place for classy cocktails with a Russian twist, inspired by avant-garde poetry  and Russian folk tales.</p><p>St Petersburg has enough great bars for several nights' worth of bar crawling (and there is nothing locals like more), but not many nightclubs. Nevertheless, the real party starts late. There's plenty of post-midnight drinking and dancing to be had at <strong>More</strong> (Malaya Morskaya 20) <strong>13</strong>, which is tucked away in an old residential building near the imperious St Isaac's cathedral. The way in – via an unmarked courtyard and up a flight of stairs – gets you in the mood for an adventure and a night of live music and cocktails. Alternatively, head back east to <strong>Architector</strong> (Millionnaya Ulitsa 10) <strong>14</strong>, a creative cluster that really comes alive at night in a passable impression of East Berlin. Superbly named skateshop <strong>Angry Boards</strong> will be shut by then, but <strong>Las Veggies</strong> churns out piping-hot mushroom soup until dawn, or whenever you spill out of one of the

Dostoevsky and Chaliapin are among the Russian cultural icons whose St Petersburg dwellings have been preserved for posterity","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-19T13:41:12Z","body":"<p>An elderly woman, trudging slowly up and down the dilapidated stairwell of a once-magnificent mansion, is the only remaining obstacle to the creation of this city's newest literary museum. If the friends and admirers of the dissident poet <a href=\"http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/4\" title=\"\">Joseph Brodsky</a> can find a way to buy the small space she still rents in what was once a communal flat within the palatial building, they hope to open a museum that will honour the writer who was forced out of the Soviet Union in 1972 and died in 1996 in New York City.</p><p>A Brodsky museum would join dozens of other small apartments, flats and houses that perpetuate the memory of St Petersburg's cultural luminaries, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky\" title=\"\">Dostoevsky</a>, Pushkin, Nabokov and Rimsky-Korsakov. For now, it remains in limbo, a few small rooms, rich in ornament and detail but hauntingly empty, awaiting resurrection as a site for the enviable yet disconcerting hero worship that Russians accord their favourite artists.</p><p>Apartment museums are scattered across St Petersburg's canals and pastel-coloured palaces, and there is persistent agitation to create more of them. Desperate to protect a historic structure that once housed an apartment used by the poet and novelist Mikhail Lermontov's grandmother, activists in May agitated for a new Lermontov museum. Before former National Symphony Orchestra director Mstislav Rostropovich died in 2007, he bought up rooms that were once lived in by the young Dmtiri Shostakovich. With his wife, the legendary soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, Rostropovich created a Shostakovich museum, and tried to give it to the city of St Petersburg. There is also a Modest Mussorgsky flat, filled with period furniture and memorabilia, also created by Rostropovich, which may someday be a museum.</p><p>Although these museums are mostly notional, they speak to the passion for memorialisation in Russian society in which culture is often felt as a loss, artists as martyrs, literature as a living trauma. Unlike in the United States, where house museums struggle to find a niche in the cultural economy, the old-fashioned, low-tech, old-guard house or apartment museum is alive and well in a city of poets, painters and musicians. It serves many functions: a way to preserve old architecture, a reaction against vulgar commercial elites and the Putinisation of Russia, and a bulwark against cultural amnesia. But the Russian house museum is also a shrine, and while many cultures create shrines to their icons, the small Russian museum has its own peculiar flavour and passion.</p><p>In the beginning, there was the Pushkin apartment, commemorating the brilliant poet who clashed with the tsar, wrote masterpieces such as Eugene Onegin and Boris Godunov, and died at 37 in a shabby 1837 duel. Located near the city's elegant Nevsky Prospekt, the Pushkin apartment is one of almost 300 Pushkin memorials small and large (from modest plaques to full-sized estates) in Russia, according to a 1993 census. It is also a venerable prototype for many of St  Petersburg's lesser-known apartment museums. Its layout, the dramatic spectacle of life and death it presents to the visitor, helped establish the basic Stations of the Cross for literary museum worship in St Petersburg.</p><p>\"These are the actual steps up which Pushkin was carried after the duel,\" says museum director Galina Sedova, guiding a visitor up brightly lit stairs that connect the ground floor (with a coat room, admission booth and small museum display) to the elegant 11-room flat in which Pushkin and his family once lived. The museum was established in the mid 1920s, in the early years of the Soviet Union, in part because anti-Bolsheviks who had fled the country shamed Russian cultural leaders into honouring the poet. The museum's design and focus have been in an intimate dance with Russian cultural politics ever since.</p><p>In the early years, according to Sedova, the museum featured only seven of the original Pushkin rooms. \"It wasn't politic to emphasise the grandeur of Pushkin's lifestyle in Soviet times,\" she says.</p><p>The Soviet-era Pushkin was presented as a great Russian archetype, rather than an elite romantic figure who came from and satirised the nobility. The sexual intrigue that led to his fatal encounter with a man alleged to be his wife's lover was downplayed. \"His death was made a matter of social conditions, not an erotic duel,\" Sedova says. Little emphasis was placed on the personal possessions, the furnishings, the historic details of the apartment, which was reconstructed based on letters and contemporary accounts from Pushkin's time.</p><p>Times change, and especially since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the apartment has been more focused on recreating the ambience of Pushkin's home. But it remains resolutely a memorial, with death its main focus. A sofa on which the poet supposedly died was tested for blood, and in 2010 – with great fanfare – Russian newspapers announced that it was Pushkin's.</p><p>The apartment visit begins with the antechamber in which Pushkin's coffin rested, and ends with the study, in which he died. The study, filled with objects that the artist had held in his hands, is the sancta sanctorum of most apartment museums.</p><p>\"The idea, when you create a memorial apartment, is to make sure that the study isn't eclipsed by any of the other rooms,\" Sedova says. So the study is the richest with objects and memorabilia: a desk where he sat, an inkwell, a letter opener he often chewed, books and the sofa.Not every apartment museum is focused on the memorial aspect, but most are haunted to some degree. In the museum devoted to Alexander Blok (the \"silver age\" poet who died in 1921), a glass case with a death mask and a religious icon stands where Blok's deathbed was, and a vase of flowers is occasionally refreshed in front of it. Even if an artist didn't die in the apartment that honours him, loss and absence are often in the foreground. A visit to the apartment of <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0149923/\" title=\"\">Feodor Chaliapin</a>, the world-renowned opera singer who left Russia in the early 1920s, features a painting of the singer that supposedly sustained a crack – discovered by Chaliapin's daughter at the moment the singer died in Paris in 1938. A tour of the capacious and beautifully appointed apartment ends in a large music room, where the disembodied voice of Chaliapin is heard singing, a poignant reminder of the singer's self-imposed exile during the years of Soviet repression.</p><p>\"We are trying to reimburse Chaliapin for what he had to suffer,\" says museum director Zinaida Getman. Across the Neva river, in a dense and shabbier part of town, the Dostoevsky apartment contains a theatre and an exhibition space devoted to the author's life and literary accomplishments – part of an effort to make the museum a cultural centre with relevance to young audiences. Like many apartment museums, the exhibition isn't so much about genuine artefacts connected to the author – the museum's director, Vera Biron, laments that \"we don't have many original items\" – but serves as a set of prompts to the guided tour. Labels in English give little context for what's on display – photographs, reproductions of important documents, a copy of the death mask. Instead, guides walk the visitor through a polished recitation of the author's career, his arrest, the infamous fake execution he survived before exile, his travels in Europe and his literary success. The objects are used more like illustrations in a text rather than genuine treasures.</p><p>But death returns as the focus when visitors encounter the author's study, with its orderly desk, small bookcase, an icon in the corner by the window and a large table clock, with its hands stopped at the hour of Dostoevsky's death.</p><p>Although many of the small apartment museums in Russia seem perpetually empty, Biron has struggled to make the Dostoevsky apartment a centre for the perpetual and perfervid enthusiasm for the author that animates Russians. But she is frustrated by insufficient funding, a theatre in disrepair and the occasional leak from nearby apartments – a hazard common to many museums in buildings that are still primarily residential.</p><p>\"Drunkards live in the house,\" says one Dostoevsky museum curator. There's something apt about the fact that the museum shares space in a building still inhabited by the flawed humanity that the author wrote about, and the view from a corner window takes in both a sex shop and a church. But like many apartment museums in St Petersburg, the Dostoevsky museum suffers from being a part of the residential landscape.</p><p>That is the main obstacle to opening the Shostakovich museum, according to Larisa Chirkova, who manages the space. The museum was conceived by Rostropovich to honour his friend and the Soviet Union's greatest composer, who wrote two concertos for the gifted cellist. In 2002, Rostropovich heard that the communal residents of the apartment in which Shostakovich lived as a young man might be willing to sell. After long negotiations, he managed to acquire all but two bedrooms, the kitchen and some service space, which remain in private hands. The apartment is filled with memorabilia, reproductions of scores, a piano and a reproduction of a 1936 newspaper article, Muddle Instead of Music, which opened Stalin's devastating attack on Shostakovich's modernist musical inclinations.</p><p>But despite an effort in 2006 to transfer ownership of the apartment to the city of St Petersburg and open it to the public, new regulations that would require it to have an entrance separate from the residential spaces have stalled the process.</p><p>\"It became absolutely impossible because the flat is on the fifth floor,\" says Chirkova, who remains hopeful that an alliance with a larger museum such as the Glinka House in Moscow might smooth the way.</p><p>But the regulation underscores how increased concerns about private property rights have changed the freewheeling world in which it was once possible to create a museum with little more than a passion, family support and some string pulling.</p><p>\"It is about safety, and a quiet space for the residents,\" says Yana Sedelnikova, who works with St Petersburg's Committee for Culture, which funds many of the city's small museums. Sedelnikova says the committee supports the city's apartment museums and wants to improve their visibility and visitorship, but rules are rules.</p><p>\"These are the regulations,\" she says. \"No one wants a store or a restaurant or a museum above your head. In previous years, there was no private property, so no such regulations. So it is just bad luck for the Shostakovich museum.\"</p><p>The city's culture committee, with a budget of $254m ($100m larger than the entire National Endowment for the Arts budget in the US), is relatively rich. And some museums, such as the Pushkin, receive national funding. But some museum directors complain of a funding system that \"kills initiative\". While some small museums such as the Blok apartment are subsumed under larger institutions (the State History Museum of St  Petersburg), most small museums must compete for a share of the roughly $28m in the culture committee's museum budget. And the process for applying for money can be complex and discouraging to museums that want to move quickly and innovate (the standard museum presentation in most apartment spaces is decades behind in design and the integration of technology).</p><p>By American standards, the culture committee's budget looks like nirvana. The US National Trust for Historic Preservation, for example, recently launched a \"Re-imagining Historic House Museums\" program in response to what one industry leader called the \"grave challenges\" that small museums face in the United States. But the American house museum and the Russian apartment museum are from different worlds. Part of the latter's charms is its pure sleepiness — the empty rooms, the old-fashioned or non-existent labels, the curious indifference to authenticity.</p><p>Russian apartment museums may occasionally look like American house museums, but it's a superficial resemblance. Fundamentally, American museums are about remedial education and conversion, introducing new audiences to culture and soliciting an emotional response. The lack of public funding that afflicts most of them is also their primary strength, forcing them to constantly seek new audiences and new sources of support. The Russian museum is about worship, often cult-like and insular. The difference in how these spaces are used is as vast as the difference between a megachurch and a sacred shrine.</p><p>The proposed Brodsky museum will be an interesting experiment because Brodsky left the Soviet Union to become part of the American intelligentsia. In 1985, Brodsky published a haunting essay, In a Room and a Half, which explored the pain of exile, the human toll of Soviet cruelty and the loss of parents through inexorable distance and finally death. The title of the essay refers to the rooms in which Brodsky lived with his parents, the same empty rooms that may someday be the core of the Brodsky museum.</p><p>Brodsky once said that he had \"switched empires\", and in his essay he transferred symbolic ownership of his \"room and a half\" to the world at large. Even after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Brodsky refused to return to Russia, to St Petersburg, to the rooms he had made famous. Telling his story fully will challenge basic Russian museum thinking. If done right, the organisers will reach out with a multilingual display, actively seek visitors from the multitudes who flock to the Hermitage and other grand sites and establish relationships with museums and cultural institutions beyond the literary neighbourhood in which Brodsky lived. But first, there is the old woman, who museum organisers say is holding out for $450,000. It's curious how many apartment museums begin with displacement, moving the old out so the even older can be celebrated anew. According to Chirkova of the Shostakovich museum, to create the Mussorgsky museum, Rostropovich arrived one day at the rooms of the communal flat and cajoled the residents into selling with a bottle or two of vodka.</p><p></p><p>One reason there are so many possible apartment museums, so many plaques on walls all over the city is that most artists in St Petersburg were urban nomads, moving from place to place. Dostoevsky lived in some 20 different apartments. So unlike the American house museum, which one expects to be a homestead expressing the ongoing investment and engagement of the owner, the apartment museum is both sacred and ephemeral.</p><p>The woman who climbs the stairwell of the proposed Brodsky museum is more than an inconvenience. She is part of the landscape, the ever shifting, wounded, chaotic social reality that is the ancient soil of Russian culture.</p><p><em>• This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekly\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Weekly</em></a><em>, which incorporates material from the Washington Post</em></p>","headline":"St Petersburg's homely tributes to Russia's great artists","trailText":"Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Chaliapin are among the Russian cultural icons whose St Petersburg dwellings have been preserved for posterity","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"Guardian Weekly","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GWeekly/2012/11/16/1353065231615/Alexander-Pushkin-House-M-009.jpg","wordcount":"2394","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"399390848","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6858170","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Philip Kennicott for the Washington Post","internalPageCode":"1828945","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-26T16:50:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/st-petersburg-russia-apartment-museums","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/20/st-petersburg-russia-apartment-museums","tags":[{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","references":[]},{"id":"travel/stpetersburg","webTitle":"St Petersburg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/stpetersburg","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/stpetersburg","references":[]},{"id":"culture/museums","webTitle":"Museums","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/museums","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/museums","references":[]},{"id":"music/opera","webTitle":"Opera","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/opera","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/opera","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"publication/guardianweekly","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly","type":"publication","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/guardianweekly","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-399514400","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/16/1353067206637/Pushkins-House-St-Petersb-008.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Corbis","photographer":"Massimo Listri","altText":"Pushkin's House, St Petersburg","height":"276","credit":"Massimo Listri/Corbis","caption":"The salon in Pushkin's apartment museum in St Petersburg.

Pooling time and money, they have painted, swept, built new walls and floors, threaded cable, assembled chandeliers.&nbsp;The result is a labyrinth of faded opulence, with whitewashed walls, exposed wood and lots of sunlight.</p><p>\"We really wanted to show that you can make everything with your own hands,\" says Alina Selezneva, who runs Taiga's <a href=\"http://space-taiga.org/booksmore\" title=\"\">tiny bookshop</a>. \"The lazy people, the people who don't want to help each other or egotistical people – this isn't the place for them.\"</p><p>Taiga's work ethic, all plaster-dust and silkscreen, stands in stark contrast to the works of Dasha Zhukova, the best-known doyenne of Russian contemporary art. Whereas Zhukova and her partner, billionaire Roman Abramovich, hustled at least £250m for their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/feb/18/roman-abramovich-island-architects\" title=\"\">proposed cultural centre</a> on the city's New Holland island, Taiga's stakeholders just get on with it: when I visit, Taiga's chief photographer is building a roof. Kachavina hurries away to prepare the exhibition hall for a lecture on Dutch book design. It all feels so far away from the Lucian Freuds and bulletproof cars of Zhukova's \"New Russia\". In fact, I remark to Selezneva, it feels a little socialist. She laughs. \"We joke about that. We were kids when communism fell, so maybe it's in our dreams somewhere.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-394073456'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343906839398/Loft-conversion---Etagi-s-008.jpg' alt='Loft conversion … Etagi’s terrace is a sanctuary from St Petersburg’s bustle' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Loft conversion … Etagi’s terrace is a sanctuary from St Petersburg’s bustle</figcaption></figure><p>This collectivism isn't so apparent in Taiga's peers. A red-bricked former factory called Tkachi, billed as a \"creative space\", feels decidedly corporate: despite the rough-hewn aesthetic, it's basically an anaemic hipster shopping centre. <a href=\"http://www.loftprojectetagi.ru/en/guide/\" title=\"\">Etagi, Russia's oldest loft</a> project, is much more of a jewel: founded in 2007, this gallery/hostel/cafe is a sanctuary from St Petersburg's bustle, with a magnificent&nbsp;terrace and delicious, affordable food. (Try the manti dumplings or \"Bird's Milk\", a chocolate cake filled with homemade marshmallow.) Etagi also hosts concerts, programmes for children and abandoned pets, plus exhibitions such as that of World Press Photos and a permanent installation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/aug/17/photography-books-limited-edition\" title=\"\">Sumo, Helmut Newton's 30kg art book</a>.</p><p>Yet one thing is conspicuously absent from all of these arts spaces: protest. As thousands clamour against Putin, with candlelight demos for Pussy Riot's punk-rock martyrs, Taiga and Etagi both emphasise their neutrality. Their members may march in the streets, standing vigil in rainbow balaclavas, but no one wants to jeopardise these fragile institutions. Politics is too dangerous.</p><p>\"Art spaces are not very open to political artists,\" admits Tania Volkova, a Moscow-based art historian and activist. \"The tendency of self-censorship [began] several years ago when big art centres started to cancel exhibitions on political art. Now this tendency is becoming stronger.\"</p><p>At least in Taiga's case, their days are already numbered. As soon as the building's owner finds a buyer, these industrious dreamers will be out on the street.\"We know this is a short period – two years or something,\" Selezneva says. Their utopia is temporary. \"But it became very special because we made it ourself.\"</p><p><em>• Taiga Space (Dvortsovaya nab. 20, </em><a href=\"http://space-taiga.org\" title=\"\"><em>space-taiga.org</em></a><em>) is open every day, but its shops and services keep different hours: check the website for details.

It is hometown for me, because it is where my mother hails from and there is no city like it. The people are wonderful, the architecture is truly breathtaking and the pace of life is just about right, a mix of the hubbub of life here and the sleepy, slow pace of rural life. Although a seasoned visitor, I am still discovering new things whenever I go. </p><p><strong> The best thing:</strong> Without doubt, it is the people: they are so friendly. They love putting the world to rights, having a laugh about how inefficient life can be in Russia and are enormously hospitable - and they love English and French. I'll get shot for saying this, but they tend to put themselves above everybody else and believe they are the intelligentsia of Russia - so you'll find a huge proportion can speak at least some English.  </p><p><strong> My ideal day:</strong> It seems odd but mushrooms are a big thing in Russia, so I'd start with a long walk in the country, preferably through a wood, picking mushrooms. I'd spend a lazy morning drinking tea and gossiping then have a huge lunch. To redeem myself, I'd go on an afternoon bike ride. The evening would include some form of light entertainment - opera, ballet or the circus - followed by a big dinner with lots of lovely Russian grub. The nightcap would be a bottle of vodka with friends, and then maybe one or two more bottles, too.  </p><p><strong> My advice:</strong> Don't be afraid to get out there and do it for yourself.

It was the midsummer season of white nights, when the sun never fully sets, and we stayed at the wedding party till morning, wandering along the Moika embankment for breakfast at the Hotel Angleterre.</p><p>It was all so different from when my husband Marc and I had lived here 15 years before, in the last Soviet winter of 1990 – the city's last as Leningrad – in the first-floor front room of 23 Pochtamtskaya Street (Post Office Street). Then the facades and entryways of Pochtamtskaya's low 18th-century houses were dilapidated, some to the point of ruin. Our room was large and warm, with a Bechstein grand and a theatrical gilt mirror that hung at an ominous 45-degree angle over the bed.</p><p>Leningrad State University, where I was enrolled for six months' graduate research, was (like the entire Soviet Union) in administrative paralysis in 1990, and unable to provide accommodation in a student hostel. Through friends, we came to a complicated barter arrangement (rent was still illegal) with a Russian opera singer who was doing a season at Covent Garden, and moved in with his mother-in-law, Irina Borisovna, who was in hibernation. \"Why go out? It's still dark!\" she would say.</p><p>Pochtamtskaya lies on the far side of St Isaac's Square from the Angleterre. Marc and I would cross the square each morning and part outside the hotel. As the sun rose, I crossed the frozen Neva to look at archives in the literary institute, Pushkin House. Marc took the tram down Nevsky Prospect to Lenfilm, where he worked as a legal adviser, translator and \"voice-over\" (\"as an American robot\", his employers insisted) for the studio's new English-language commercials.</p><p>That winter, the Angleterre was closed for renovation. I longed for it to open. I imagined sitting in a comfortable chair, looking up at the angels on the roof of St Isaac's Cathedral, drinking good coffee from a clean cup. One week, a literary group gathered outside to protest against the gutting of the building. The poet Sergei Esenin – who called himself a hooligan – had hanged himself in room five in 1925, leaving a farewell poem written in his own blood. The poetry-lovers wanted the room preserved in his memory: beams, heating pipes, plaster. Street protests still had an edge of danger then, but when Irina Borisovna saw their earnest placards on the evening news she did not, for once, say \"hooligans\".</p><p>Food was rationed. Our Russian friends worried that we were hungry. I was embarrassed to tell them that for a couple of dollars we could buy enough to last us a week from the gold-toothed Caucasians at the market: fine cuts of meat, cheese, honey and fresh produce. When a friend brought a kilo of beef that her mother had stolen for us from her factory canteen, my embarrassment turned to shame.</p><p>Irina Borisovna had many visitors. Old women who had worked with her late husband in the Party came to sit on the divan and watch TV. \"How will it all end?\" they asked each other. Their sense of apocalypse entered my sensibility and I wrote letters home that must have seemed half-crazed, about some terrible gathering force that would blow everything away.</p><p>Before we returned to England in spring 1991, Gorbachev appointed to the Politburo the sinister men who would oust him in a coup that August. He made a paranoid speech about \"enemies\". People were anxious, and we wrote out visa \"invitations\" to the UK for Soviet friends and friends-of-friends. In the event, Leningrad, whose citizens had voted in June to give their city back its original name, resisted the coup, under the leadership of their liberal mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, and his canny deputy, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>One of Irina Borisovna's friends gave me a fur coat to send from the west to a woman in Israel. She had saved his life in a labour camp, smuggling him leftovers from the camp kitchen. He had dreamed of giving her a fur coat to thank her, he said, but when he could finally afford it, he learned that she had suddenly emigrated. \"It's just rabbit fur,\" Irina Borisovna said after he'd left. \"What will she want with it in Tel Aviv?\"</p><p>Several months after I had posted it, the coat had come back from Israel, the box marked \"addressee unknown\". I called Irina Borisovna. Her friend had suffered a stroke, and the coat would be stolen at Russian customs if I sent it back. London charity shops would not take the coat because it was fur, so I pushed it into a clothing drop on a high street.

But Russia can be a strange place at the moment. In the turbulent cultural atmosphere surrounding <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10151790/Vladimir-Putin-signs-anti-gay-propaganda-bill.html\" title=\"\">the country's passing of a law banning</a> the promotion of \"gay propaganda\" earlier this year, it doesn't take much to light the blue touchpaper.</p><p>I've just returned from three days at <a href=\"http://www.dramafest.ru\" title=\"\">St Petersburg's inaugural International Winter theatre festival</a>. International co-operation was the unofficial theme: some of Europe's biggest theatre directors were invited to attend, with a programme – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/09/lev-dodin-theatre\" title=\"\">curated by Lev Dodin, veteran director of the city's Maly theatre</a> – designed to show St Petersburg asserting its historic role as Russia's gateway to the wider world. It was an eclectic, Euro-heavy bill: Mozart directed with dextrous lightness by Peter Brook, an anti-fascist piece by Belgian auteur Luk Perceval, the Russian debut of <a href=\"http://www.piccoloteatro.org/\" title=\"\">Milan's Piccolo theatre</a> under the stewardship of movie star Toni Servillo, all topped with a slice of the Austrian avant-garde, a version of <a href=\"http://handke-drama.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/die-schonen-tage-von-aranjuez.html\" title=\"\">Peter Handke's idiosyncratic Die schönen Tage von Aranjuez</a> by the Swiss provocateur Luc Bondy. Dodin told me: \"There's so much discourse happening inside Russia at the moment about whether Russia is part of Europe or not, whether the Russian way is a separate way, whether the country is closed or open.\" He firmly believes, he added, that it should be the latter.</p><p>But not everyone wants it that way. The controversy began at the festival's opening performance, <a href=\"http://www.inyourpocket.com/russia/st-petersburg/concerts-culture-events-entertainment/Special-Events-National-Holidays/19:00-Death-in-Venice-Kindertotenlieder_122157v\" title=\"\">Death in Venice/Kindertotenlieder</a> by Berlin's Schaubühne company. During the curtain call, the director, Thomas Ostermeier, took to the stage and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5aYpsuwkuE&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\" title=\"\">explained that the show nearly hadn't happened</a>: the company had been on the point of deciding not to attend in protest at Russia's new anti-gay laws. He concluded, to applause and cheers from the audience, that the performance would be dedicated to the country's gay community.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5aYpsuwkuE&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">Reading on mobile? Click to view</a></p><p>It's not the first time that culture has been swept up into the debate about this crackdown on what <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1130071/russia-anti-gay-row-invented-by-western-media\" title=\"\">Russia's sports minister squirmingly called \"non-traditional sexual relations\"</a>. In London and New York, concerts by the conductor Valery Gergiev, director of St Petersburg's prestigious Mariinsky theatre, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/valery-gergiev-concert-picketed-gay-rights-supporters\" title=\"\">have been picketed because of his close relationship with Putin</a>. And just last week, Gus Van Sant lent his support to the city's LGBT film festival Side by Side, which <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/article/que-e-ries-the-plight-of-a-brave-lgbt-film-festival-in-russia-and-how-to-help-them-continue-their\" title=\"\">has been fined thousands of pounds under another set of new laws</a> (Side by Side insists the fines are politically motivated). With fewer than 100 days to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, it's a fair bet that protests – and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/winter-olympics-2014-pussy-riot-join-campaign-for-sochi-boycott-8884990.html\" title=\"\">calls to boycott the games</a> – will increase in volume.</p><p>But Ostermeier's speech, rapidly uploaded to YouTube, provoked a counter-assault: by the following morning <a href=\"http://calvertjournal.com/news/show/1787/cossacks-attack-theatre-staging-death-in-venice-for-promoting-paedophilia\">the entrance to the theatre had been daubed with graffiti reading \"mraz\" (\"scum\")</a>. Accompanying this handiwork, sinisterly, was a pig's head. No one I talked to was sure who was behind it – the evidence had long been removed by the time I got there – but, <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/blogs/432775/post/a-week-of-controversy-in-russian-culture/490123.html\" title=\"\">according to the Moscow Times, a group calling  itself the Cossacks of St Petersburg claimed responsibility</a>. Previously they have protested at <a href=\"http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=37123\" title=\"\">an exhibition accused of being anti-religious</a>, and forced the cancellation of a one-man version of Nabokov's Lolita.</p><p>Ostermeier himself is hardly a shrinking violet, though generally he prefers to keep his controversy on stage. At the Schaubühne he has championed the work of some of Germany's most provocative directors, and in Berlin earlier this year I watched his own version of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/theater/reviews/a-contemporary-enemy-of-the-people-at-the-harvey-theater.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Enemy of the People</a>. This spliced the original text with an anarchist tract culled from the web, leaving it open as to whether Ibsen's hero is a man courageously standing up for the rights of the individual or a dangerous fanatic (the audience is invited to heckle Stockmann directly, before he is pelted with black paint – as graphic a representation of internet trolling as I've seen).</p><p>Speaking on the phone a few days later, Ostermeier insisted that his St Petersburg speech hadn't been a stunt: there had been genuine concern within the company about whether it was safe to bring a show about an elderly man's love for a 14-year-old boy to Russia – particularly by Josef Bierbichler, the actor playing Aschenbach himself. \"He was hesitating for weeks,\" Ostermeier said, noting that the vice-ambassador of the Netherlands <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24545441\" title=\"\">had recently been attacked and had anti-gay graffiti left inside his flat</a>, and pointing to a shooting in St Petersburg two weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/russia-gay-club-shooting_n_4296064.html\" title=\"\">when two gunmen opened fire outside a gay club</a>. \"We really had to convince him to come.\"</p><p>In the end, they decided to travel – not least because of the show's unapologetic exploration of desire and obsession. \"We hoped that it would add something to the discussion,\" Ostermeier said, \"but also we decided that it was necessary to say out loud that we are against this law. I don't want to tell Russians what to do, that's not my role, but it felt like something we had to say.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-423946009'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/2/1385997272654/Death-in-Venice-007.jpg' alt='Death in Venice' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Death in Venice. Photograph: Arno Declair</figcaption></figure><p>Dodin himself was at pains to minimise the pig's-head incident – \"there are so many crazy people,\" he told me – but seemed well aware of the wider significance. \"You have to remember that under Soviet power, 15 years ago, not only the so-called promotion of homosexuality was a crime, but homosexuality itself was considered a crime. A lot of things are still with us. We are somewhat barbarian.\"</p><p>But many feel that it's high time major Russian artists made more noise on the issue of gay rights. \"It's getting to a point in Russia where things really get worrying,\" said Ostermeier. \"The time is over where they can come to an arrangement with the political situation.\" On his mind, he added darkly, was a novel by another Mann, Thomas's son Klaus: 1936's Mephisto, a scalding, semi-fictional satire of the relationship between a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223635.Mephisto\" title=\"\">rapaciously ambitious German star and a group of high-ranking, <em>kultur</em>-loving Nazis</a>. The parallels for artists cosying up to Vladimir Putin – <a href=\"http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/putins-dead-poets-society/\" title=\"\">as many leading Russian writers did at a specially convened event last week</a> – are disquieting, to say the least.</p><p>In the end, though, Russian theatre seems to be coming up with its own responses to the political pressures being felt. One of the shows I saw in Petersburg was <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/blogs/432775/post/golden-mask-nominees-announced/489649.html\" title=\"\">Dodin's own youthful and sharp-as-a-blade production of Luise Miller</a>, which has startled Russian critics by turning Schiller's notoriously unwieldy play into a brisk parable about the merciless operations of power. Presided over by a scheming courtier who is prepared to sacrifice his own son's happiness – and ultimately his life – for political capital, it suggests a bleak view of politics: as inescapable, machiavellian, hopelessly corrupt.</p><p>Myself, I couldn't help detecting a repeated resemblance in Dodin's production between the count's henchmen, <a href=\"http://www.spletnik.ru/events/40516-kozlovskiy-rappoport-i-boyarskaya-spektakl-dlya-detey-babochek.html\" title=\"\">with their matching earpieces and KGB-issue haircuts</a>, to a certain Russian president. Was I seeing things, I asked the director afterwards. He smiled owlishly. \"Well, this is the motto of the festival: to hold the mirror up to nature.\"</p>","headline":"St Petersburg theatre festival: Death in Venice, trouble in Russia","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Dickson:</strong> Amid unrest over the government's 'gay propaganda' laws, international directors grapple with politics – and a pig's head</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/2/1385997265762/Death-in-Venice-002.jpg","wordcount":"1159","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"423923182","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8395417","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Andrew Dickson","internalPageCode":"2006598","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-09T13:35:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/02/russia-st-petersburg-theatre-festival","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/2013/dec/02/russia-st-petersburg-theatre-festival","tags":[{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrewdickson","webTitle":"Andrew Dickson","rcsId":"GNL021940","r2ContributorId":"15361","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Columnist/Head_shots/2010/3/2/1267557160008/Andrew-Dickson-Guardian-s-001.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Dickson is a writer and critic for the Guardian, writing arts interviews and features for Review and G2, and presenting culture videos.

This chain of Russian Orthodox showstoppers is raked with biblical shafts of light.</p><p>Trouble is, I can’t fully appreciate it. I have two hands on a chimneystack, one eye on a dangling high-voltage cable and my heart in my mouth. From where I’m nervously perched, feet either side of a sharply sloping roof, it’s just a short tumble before a six-storey drop to the street.</p><p>Rooftop climbs in St Petersburg aren’t for anyone who suffers from vertigo, or doesn’t have a good sense of balance. They tap into the latest vogue, driven by social media, for young locals to hang out on the tops of the city’s baroque and neoclassical buildings: a digital resurgence of a romantic summer tradition.</p><p>Now some of the “roofers” are offering the experience to visitors – their tour details are often stencilled on to city-centre pavements – with the lure of widescreen historic panoramas uncluttered by skyscrapers.</p><p>I took a less random approach, using <a href=\"http://b-abo.com/countries/russia/saint-petersburg/\">BeAbo</a>, a company recommended to me by a British tour operator. It offers a range of alternative excursions, including Masonic St Petersburg, “Love Without Restrictions” (a spin around the history of famous locals’ dangerous liaisons) and a visit to the Soviet Slot Machine Museum.</p><p>This may be a more official approach, but the tour is still laced with cold war intrigue. When I arrive in the city I receive a blunt text: “Roof walk. 4.08. 1800. Vladimirskaya metro station. Roofer will connect with you.” The message gives no clue as to how I’ll recognise him. Requests remain unanswered.</p><p>I’m there at 6pm. I wait among a gaggle of babushkas selling vegetables. An hour passes. I’m still there, eyeing up strange men. When he finally texts, I discover that he’s at the station exit; I’m at the entrance. More Austin Powers than 007.</p><p>Sergey Genkin, my 29-year-old “stalker”, as Russians call the guides, is not alone. There’s another tour member, Katerina from Ukraine, who is sporting spectacularly inappropriate gear: hot pants, designer handbag and knee-high velvet boots. You won’t see that on the Eiger.</p><p>We zigzag through streets, before darting into the courtyard of a magnificent, if slightly tired, art nouveau apartment block, with wrought iron balconies and a Parisian-style cupola. Sergey ushers us into the building, using a forged key to unlock the door and his skill as an IT engineer to “neutralise” the alarm. The golden rule is to be as discreet as possible. Roof climbing, like wild camping in the Lake District, is tolerated, rather than legal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7e9ae048-524b-4207-9a25-38d62b155705\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/14/1408014821286/d28d0a6e-b62e-4a75-b32f-132a0353fb41-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ian up on the roof\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ian up on the roof</figcaption> </figure>  <p>After ascending the stairs in total silence, past a warning sign – “Look after your children: they can fall from windows” – we clamber out of the roof space through a wooden dormer. First the warm light hits me, then the unnerving drop.</p><p>Sergey, with a mountaineer’s whip-thin physique, offers reassurance and a strong arm. I scramble on all fours like a fat spider, and perform a toddler’s arse shuffle before sitting on the spine of the roof. I peer down, clench my buttocks and steady my nerves.</p><p>Slowly, after several white-knuckle minutes, I start to relax. Sergey explains which chimney bricks to hold, where to walk, and which of the tangle of head-high wires are safe to hold. I stand unaided for the first time, admiring the epic view.</p><p>After stepping onto rusting tin sheets that flex alarmingly – “don’t worry: they support heavy snow” – we scale a small wall to reach the next level, using a ventilation shaft for support. “We have a saying,” says Sergey, gazing towards the Admiralty’s glimmering spire. “To be a true citizen of St Petersburg, you must have shared a communal flat, and you must have visited the roofs.”</p><p>He tells me proudly that his city is the best on earth for the pastime. It’s not just the uninterrupted vistas and the kilometres of linked period buildings, he explains – it’s the Russian attitude to property. “Spot someone on your roof in Britain and you call the police or get a gun. Here people don’t mind so much.”</p><p>As I ponder using an AK47 to protect the Welsh slate on my south London flat, I realise urban climbing’s appeal works at micro as well as macro level. Across the courtyard a woman is smoking while watching television; another is watering a plant. It’s strangely hypnotic.</p><p>I expect Sergey to tell of saucy sights he’s seen – worthy of a 1970s window cleaner – but the most shocking thing for him was graffiti on the cross on top of Kazan Cathedral. “How could they? These were vandals from the former Soviet republics.”</p><p>For our second climb, we head along Marata Street. Just past a Bavarian beer hall, we enter a yellow apartment block, where Lenin’s portrait rests on an attic fuse box. The view is still superb – we’re just above Nevsky Prospect, St Petersburg’s answer to Oxford Street – but this is more about walking than climbing, with four courtyards linking wider, less vertiginous roofs. It’s a lot less scary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b3e055e-8643-443c-9bdc-f45c792e9537\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/14/1408015038118/9a563538-7dfa-443c-87ca-c9b95ea1dd95-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sergey above Nesky Prospekt\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sergey above Nesky Prospekt</figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’re not alone up here. There’s an eight-strong tour group 100 metres ahead, while an amorous couple are sharing champagne and the sunset next to a graffiti-splattered chimney. As we stroll along, Sergey talks about the buzz of climbing. “All day, I look at an office computer,” he sighs. “But after work I head to the roofs and feel free. It’s a way of life.”</p><p>We complete the square, clambering confidently between levels, using a homemade wire ladder fixed in place, with an aerial for support. Fun has now replaced fear. A stretch of shiny new tin lets us clank past Alexander Pushkin’s old flat on the opposite side of the street, before our tour ends. Had we more time, we could easily continue for another two kilometres.</p><p>We descend in a tiny claustrophobic lift. As the rickety plywood doors close, Sergey, who just minutes before had been hanging off the edge of the building with an arm and a leg over the void, crosses himself and mutters “in God we trust”. St Petersburg’s creaky roofs are one thing, its creaky lifts quite another.</p><p>• <em>Accommodation and flights were provided by Baltic Holidays (0845 0705711, </em><a href=\"http://www.balticholidays.com/\"><em>balticholidays.com</em></a><em>), which has three nights B&amp;B at Casa Leto hotel in central St Petersburg from £639pp, including visa support, transfers and flights.

remaining obstacle to the creation of this city's newest literary museum. If the friends and admirers of the dissident poet <a href=\"http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/4\" title=\"\">Joseph Brodsky</a> can find a way to buy the small space she still rents in what was once a communal flat within the palatial building, they hope to open a museum that will honour the writer who was forced out of the Soviet Union in 1972 and died in 1996 in New York City.</p><p>A Brodsky museum would join dozens of other small apartments, flats and houses that perpetuate the memory of St Petersburg's cultural luminaries, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky\" title=\"\">Dostoevsky</a>, Pushkin, Nabokov and Rimsky-Korsakov. For now, it remains in limbo, a few small rooms, rich in ornament and detail but hauntingly empty, awaiting resurrection as a site for the enviable yet disconcerting hero worship that Russians accord their favourite artists.</p><p>Apartment museums are scattered across St Petersburg's canals and pastel-coloured palaces, and there is persistent agitation to create more of them. Desperate to protect a historic structure that once housed an apartment used by the poet and novelist Mikhail Lermontov's grandmother, activists in May agitated for a new Lermontov museum. Before former National Symphony Orchestra director Mstislav Rostropovich died in 2007, he bought up rooms that were once lived in by the young Dmtiri Shostakovich. With his wife, the legendary soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, Rostropovich created a Shostakovich museum, and tried to give it to the city of St Petersburg. There is also a Modest Mussorgsky flat, filled with period furniture and memorabilia, also created by Rostropovich, which may someday be a museum.</p><p>Although these museums are mostly notional, they speak to the passion for memorialisation in Russian society in which culture is often felt as a loss, artists as martyrs, literature as a living trauma. Unlike in the United States, where house museums struggle to find a niche in the cultural economy, the old-fashioned, low-tech, old-guard house or apartment museum is alive and well in a city of poets, painters and musicians. It serves many functions: a way to preserve old architecture, a reaction against vulgar commercial elites and the Putinisation of Russia, and a bulwark against cultural amnesia. But the Russian house museum is also a shrine, and while many cultures create shrines to their icons, the small Russian museum has its own peculiar flavour and passion.</p><p>In the beginning, there was the Pushkin apartment, commemorating the brilliant poet who clashed with the tsar, wrote masterpieces such as Eugene Onegin and Boris Godunov, and died at 37 in a shabby 1837 duel. Located near the city's elegant Nevsky Prospekt, the Pushkin apartment is one of almost 300 Pushkin memorials small and large (from modest plaques to full-sized estates) in Russia, according to a 1993 census. It is also a venerable prototype for many of St  Petersburg's lesser-known apartment museums. Its layout, the dramatic spectacle of life and death it presents to the visitor, helped establish the basic Stations of the Cross for literary museum worship in St Petersburg.</p><p>\"These are the actual steps up which Pushkin was carried after the duel,\" says museum director Galina Sedova, guiding a visitor up brightly lit stairs that connect the ground floor (with a coat room, admission booth and small museum display) to the elegant 11-room flat in which Pushkin and his family once lived. The museum was established in the mid 1920s, in the early years of the Soviet Union, in part because anti-Bolsheviks who had fled the country shamed Russian cultural leaders into honouring the poet. The museum's design and focus have been in an intimate dance with Russian cultural politics ever since.</p><p>In the early years, according to Sedova, the museum featured only seven of the original Pushkin rooms. \"It wasn't politic to emphasise the grandeur of Pushkin's lifestyle in Soviet times,\" she says.</p><p>The Soviet-era Pushkin was presented as a great Russian archetype, rather than an elite romantic figure who came from and satirised the nobility. The sexual intrigue that led to his fatal encounter with a man alleged to be his wife's lover was downplayed. \"His death was made a matter of social conditions, not an erotic duel,\" Sedova says. Little emphasis was placed on the personal possessions, the furnishings, the historic details of the apartment, which was reconstructed based on letters and contemporary accounts from Pushkin's time.</p><p>Times change, and especially since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the apartment has been more focused on recreating the ambience of Pushkin's home. But it remains resolutely a memorial, with death its main focus. A sofa on which the poet supposedly died was tested for blood, and in 2010 – with great fanfare – Russian newspapers announced that it was Pushkin's.</p><p>The apartment visit begins with the antechamber in which Pushkin's coffin rested, and ends with the study, in which he died. The study, filled with objects that the artist had held in his hands, is the sancta sanctorum of most apartment museums.</p><p>\"The idea, when you create a memorial apartment, is to make sure that the study isn't eclipsed by any of the other rooms,\" Sedova says. So the study is the richest with objects and memorabilia: a desk where he sat, an inkwell, a letter opener he often chewed, books and the sofa.Not every apartment museum is focused on the memorial aspect, but most are haunted to some degree. In the museum devoted to Alexander Blok (the \"silver age\" poet who died in 1921), a glass case with a death mask and a religious icon stands where Blok's deathbed was, and a vase of flowers is occasionally refreshed in front of it. Even if an artist didn't die in the apartment that honours him, loss and absence are often in the foreground. A visit to the apartment of <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0149923/\" title=\"\">Feodor Chaliapin</a>, the world-renowned opera singer who left Russia in the early 1920s, features a painting of the singer that supposedly sustained a crack – discovered by Chaliapin's daughter at the moment the singer died in Paris in 1938. A tour of the capacious and beautifully appointed apartment ends in a large music room, where the disembodied voice of Chaliapin is heard singing, a poignant reminder of the singer's self-imposed exile during the years of Soviet repression.</p><p>\"We are trying to reimburse Chaliapin for what he had to suffer,\" says museum director Zinaida Getman. Across the Neva river, in a dense and shabbier part of town, the Dostoevsky apartment contains a theatre and an exhibition space devoted to the author's life and literary accomplishments – part of an effort to make the museum a cultural centre with relevance to young audiences. Like many apartment museums, the exhibition isn't so much about genuine artefacts connected to the author – the museum's director, Vera Biron, laments that \"we don't have many original items\" – but serves as a set of prompts to the guided tour. Labels in English give little context for what's on display – photographs, reproductions of important documents, a copy of the death mask. Instead, guides walk the visitor through a polished recitation of the author's career, his arrest, the infamous fake execution he survived before exile, his travels in Europe and his literary success. The objects are used more like illustrations in a text rather than genuine treasures.</p><p>But death returns as the focus when visitors encounter the author's study, with its orderly desk, small bookcase, an icon in the corner by the window and a large table clock, with its hands stopped at the hour of Dostoevsky's death.</p><p>Although many of the small apartment museums in Russia seem perpetually empty, Biron has struggled to make the Dostoevsky apartment a centre for the perpetual and perfervid enthusiasm for the author that animates Russians. But she is frustrated by insufficient funding, a theatre in disrepair and the occasional leak from nearby apartments – a hazard common to many museums in buildings that are still primarily residential.</p><p>\"Drunkards live in the house,\" says one Dostoevsky museum curator. There's something apt about the fact that the museum shares space in a building still inhabited by the flawed humanity that the author wrote about, and the view from a corner window takes in both a sex shop and a church. But like many apartment museums in St Petersburg, the Dostoevsky museum suffers from being a part of the residential landscape.</p><p>That is the main obstacle to opening the Shostakovich museum, according to Larisa Chirkova, who manages the space. The museum was conceived by Rostropovich to honour his friend and the Soviet Union's greatest composer, who wrote two concertos for the gifted cellist. In 2002, Rostropovich heard that the communal residents of the apartment in which Shostakovich lived as a young man might be willing to sell. After long negotiations, he managed to acquire all but two bedrooms, the kitchen and some service space, which remain in private hands. The apartment is filled with memorabilia, reproductions of scores, a piano and a reproduction of a 1936 newspaper article, Muddle Instead of Music, which opened Stalin's devastating attack on Shostakovich's modernist musical inclinations.</p><p>But despite an effort in 2006 to transfer ownership of the apartment to the city of St Petersburg and open it to the public, new regulations that would require it to have an entrance separate from the residential spaces have stalled the process.</p><p>\"It became absolutely impossible because the flat is on the fifth floor,\" says Chirkova, who remains hopeful that an alliance with a larger museum such as the Glinka House in Moscow might smooth the way.</p><p>But the regulation underscores how increased concerns about private property rights have changed the freewheeling world in which it was once possible to create a museum with little more than a passion, family support and some string pulling.</p><p>\"It is about safety, and a quiet space for the residents,\" says Yana Sedelnikova, who works with St Petersburg's Committee for Culture, which funds many of the city's small museums. Sedelnikova says the committee supports the city's apartment museums and wants to improve their visibility and visitorship, but rules are rules.</p><p>\"These are the regulations,\" she says. \"No one wants a store or a restaurant or a museum above your head. In previous years, there was no private property, so no such regulations. So it is just bad luck for the Shostakovich museum.\"</p><p>The city's culture committee, with a budget of $254m ($100m larger than the entire National Endowment for the Arts budget in the US), is relatively rich. And some museums, such as the Pushkin, receive national funding. But some museum directors complain of a funding system that \"kills initiative\". While some small museums such as the Blok apartment are subsumed under larger institutions (the State History Museum of St  Petersburg), most small museums must compete for a share of the roughly $28m in the culture committee's museum budget. And the process for applying for money can be complex and discouraging to museums that want to move quickly and innovate (the standard museum presentation in most apartment spaces is decades behind in design and the integration of technology).</p><p>By American standards, the culture committee's budget looks like nirvana. The US National Trust for Historic Preservation, for example, recently launched a \"Re-imagining Historic House Museums\" program in response to what one industry leader called the \"grave challenges\" that small museums face in the United States. But the American house museum and the Russian apartment museum are from different worlds. Part of the latter's charms is its pure sleepiness — the empty rooms, the old-fashioned or non-existent labels, the curious indifference to authenticity.</p><p>Russian apartment museums may occasionally look like American house museums, but it's a superficial resemblance. Fundamentally, American museums are about remedial education and conversion, introducing new audiences to culture and soliciting an emotional response. The lack of public funding that afflicts most of them is also their primary strength, forcing them to constantly seek new audiences and new sources of support. The Russian museum is about worship, often cult-like and insular. The difference in how these spaces are used is as vast as the difference between a megachurch and a sacred shrine.</p><p>The proposed Brodsky museum will be an interesting experiment because Brodsky left the Soviet Union to become part of the American intelligentsia. In 1985, Brodsky published a haunting essay, In a Room and a Half, which explored the pain of exile, the human toll of Soviet cruelty and the loss of parents through inexorable distance and finally death. The title of the essay refers to the rooms in which Brodsky lived with his parents, the same empty rooms that may someday be the core of the Brodsky museum.</p><p>Brodsky once said that he had \"switched empires\", and in his essay he transferred symbolic ownership of his \"room and a half\" to the world at large. Even after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Brodsky refused to return to Russia, to St Petersburg, to the rooms he had made famous. Telling his story fully will challenge basic Russian museum thinking. If done right, the organisers will reach out with a multilingual display, actively seek visitors from the multitudes who flock to the Hermitage and other grand sites and establish relationships with museums and cultural institutions beyond the literary neighbourhood in which Brodsky lived. But first, there is the old woman, who museum organisers say is holding out for $450,000. It's curious how many apartment museums begin with displacement, moving the old out so the even older can be celebrated anew. According to Chirkova of the Shostakovich museum, to create the Mussorgsky museum, Rostropovich arrived one day at the rooms of the communal flat and cajoled the residents into selling with a bottle or two of vodka.</p><p></p><p>One reason there are so many possible apartment museums, so many plaques on walls all over the city is that most artists in St Petersburg were urban nomads, moving from place to place. Dostoevsky lived in some 20 different apartments. So unlike the American house museum, which one expects to be a homestead expressing the ongoing investment and engagement of the owner, the apartment museum is both sacred and ephemeral.</p><p>The woman who climbs the stairwell of the proposed Brodsky museum is more than an inconvenience.
