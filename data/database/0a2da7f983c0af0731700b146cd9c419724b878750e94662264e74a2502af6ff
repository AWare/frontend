Stop writing only what you want to write","trailText":"Earning a living as a writer is as likely as winning the lottery. Instead of writing books and persuading others to buy them, find out what people want to write, then do it for them","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I left school with a burning urge to lead the life of a writer: travelling like Byron, feted like Wilde before his fall, creating laughter like Wodehouse and crafting sentences like Nabokov. I had no professional contacts, so I wrote my masterpieces speculatively, and every path I went down ended with a rejection slip or total silence. The perceived wisdom then, as now, was that earning a living as a writer was about as likely as winning a lottery.</p> <p>Then I discovered the secret of marketing: instead of writing things and trying to persuade people to buy them, I would find out what writing services people needed and offer to provide them. So, at the same time as begging publishers and editors for commissions, I made myself available to anyone who might want to write an article or a book but did not feel able to do it for themselves.</p> <p>I have just finished a three-year stint on the management committee of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.societyofauthors.org/\">The Society of Authors</a>; I know how hard it is for many writers to make a living. But it has never been easy.</p> <p>I have now spent over 40 years as a freelance author and ghostwriter, during which time I have kept a meticulous record of every penny earned and can, with hindsight, see exactly how my personal experiment has panned out.</p> <p>Although it was about 10 years before I could support myself fully from my writing, over the course of those 40 years I have earned around £4m. Obviously there were some feasts and famines along the way, but by and large the graph has travelled upwards year upon year. From a starting point of about £1,000 a year, 20 years later I hit six figures for the first time, and for the last decade the annual figure has wavered between £150,000 and £200,000. That puts me roughly on a par with the prime minister – but with fewer perks and fewer responsibilities – a level I am more than content with.</p> <p>The vast majority of that money has come from ghostwriting, some from fees paid by wealthy individuals and some in royalties from books that became bestsellers. Every time I agreed to a split in royalties instead of a fee, I was taking a gamble; sometimes I would end up writing a whole book for virtually nothing. Looking back now, however, it was also these gambles that paid off the most handsomely. One book, for instance, has earned me more than half a million. Quite a few have earned me more than £100,000. It is possible to ghost four books a year – although three is more comfortable – which means that in most years the ones that earned nothing have been compensated for by the successes.</p> <p>By making my primary living from selling writing services, I have been able to risk taking the time out to write speculative “passion projects” – in my case, novels. Two of these novels have ghostwriters as narrators and were inspired by people I met and places I gained access to as a ghost. In <a href=\"http://andrewcrofts.com/pretty/\">Pretty Little Packages</a>, the narrator is plunged into the world of people-trafficking and sex-slavery, while <a href=\"http://andrewcrofts.com/fiction/\">Secrets of the Italian Gardener</a> is set in the palace of a Middle Eastern dictator who is telling his story to a ghostwriter during the outbreak of the Arab spring. I wonder how many palaces and brothels I would have got to see if I had stayed in my garret and written the books I dreamed of writing as a teenager, and whether I would ever have been able to earn a living and support a family.</p> <p>What would I say to the young person setting out to be a writer today? First, I would ask if they want to write for their own pleasure and fulfilment, or whether they want to use writing to support themselves financially. If it is the latter, they must furnish their brains with something that they can write about, gain access to information that other people are willing to pay for or provide a service that others need to buy.</p> <p>The odds that your passion projects alone will ever make enough money to support you in any decent style are about the same as when you buy a lottery ticket, so you are inevitably going to have to do something else to earn money in the coming years. But there is an advantage to moving into crafts such as journalism or ghostwriting: they give you access to experiences. The more varied and interesting your life and experiences, the more likely that you will have something worth writing about. The more time you spend honing your writing skills through these crafts, the sharper those skills will be when the time comes for you to try to sell your passion projects to an uninterested world.</p> <p>When we get to the later years of our lives it is good to have some stories, adventures and interesting experiences with which to regale our grandchildren – hopefully something more than a sorry tale of sitting at a computer screen, making up stories that not many people ever wanted to buy.</p> <ul> <li><em>Andrew Crofts is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confessions-of-a-ghostwriter.html\">Confessions of a Ghostwriter</a>.</em><br /></li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ffmm","wordcount":"874","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b12079dd65ca46d5de7ee3dd76e124359a38d42a/0_2086_3814_2288/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Earning a living as a writer is as likely as winning the lottery.

He has the usual book hauls, wrap ups and recommendations but he does them with such charm and liveliness. Some of the best videos are where he takes his audience book shopping with him and his Free Book Friday videos are very entertaining. A very good vlogger to follow!</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKX0VKoLARCqSFXoolsObLQ\">Tiny Reads</a> </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZYhFRePBvk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZYhFRePBvk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>We recommend this vlogger because she is so passionate about reading. We love in particular her bookshelf tour, her book shopping in London, and her What’s in My Bag video. Tiny Reads also has giveaways which you can enter and even though she is fairly new to the blog scene her channel is definitely one to watch.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tessaROXX\">Tessa Netting </a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxF1iJbmoM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnxF1iJbmoM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This one is popular among group because she mostly talks about Harry Potter. Potter merchandising, books and characters are her passion and she is a self-proclaimed Ravenclaw (because of her love for books!). The funniest video on her channel in our opinion (and we watched this at group ALL the way through) is her 100 things to do when you are not at Hogwarts video. If you are a huge Harry Potter fan (like most of us in group are – the Harry vs Draco debate occurs almost every meet!) then you will discover some cool Potter stuff on this channel!</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fv7j","wordcount":"506","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/12a5e63c5f81616b0cf9b6b9d96496a2c8a2afde/0_141_4256_2555/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>If you’re looking for someone who shares your passion for reading, offers recommendations and maybe even organises a books giveaway every now and then, then watching YouTube book vloggers is perfect for you.

Pointing out that “authors remain the only essential part of the creation of a book and it is in everyone’s interests to ensure they can make a living”, it tells publishers that “unfair contract terms, including reduced royalty rates, are a major part of the problem”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/03/struggling-authors-applying-for-emergency-funds-in-record-numbers\">Struggling authors applying for emergency funds in record numbers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pullman, the current president of the society, said that the case for fair terms for writers was “overwhelming”.<br /></p> <p>“From our positions as individual creators, whether of fiction or non-fiction, we authors see a landscape occupied by several large interests, some of them gathering profits in the billions, some of them displaying a questionable attitude to paying tax, some of them colonising the internet with projects whose reach is limitless and whose attitude to creators’ rights is roughly that of the steamroller to the ant,” said Pullman.</p> <p>“It’s a daunting landscape, far more savage and hostile to the author than any we’ve seen before. But one thing hasn’t changed, which is the ignored, unacknowledged, but complete dependence of those great interests on us and on our talents and on the work we do in the quiet of our solitude. They have enormous financial and political power, but no creative power whatsoever. Whether we’re poets, historians, writers of cookery books, novelists, travel writers, that comes from us alone. We originate the material they exploit.”</p> <p>The society wants authors to receive at least 50% of ebook revenue, rather than 25%, and is also asking publishers not to discriminate against writers “who don’t have powerful agents”.</p> <p>“Some publishers are excellent but we see many inequitable contracts. Without serious contract reform, the professional author will become an endangered species and publishers – as well as society at large – will be left with less and less quality content,” says the letter, sent by Society of Authors’ chief executive Nicola Solomon. “Unless publishers treat their authors more equitably the decline in the number of full-time writers could have serious implications for the breadth and quality of content that drives the economic success and cultural reputation of our creative industries in the UK.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/earnings-authors-below-minimum-wage\">Median earnings of professional authors fall below the minimum wage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All writers want, said Pullman, “is fairness”. “We don’t want these great powers to disappear altogether: the things they do are often things that need doing. Books are physical objects that need to be manufactured and transported and sold, or digital entities that need to be formatted and made available online. Sometimes there are things we wish they would do a little more of: editorial standards are not what they were. All those things are necessary and should be rewarded – but rewarded fairly. So is our work, and so should we,” said the novelist.</p> <p>“It’s not as though the present state of things is natural and inevitable, part of the inexorable movement of history, the unstoppable juggernaut of progress. It’s a human construction, and can be altered and improved by human intervention. That is something that happens all the time. We would like it to happen again now.”</p> <p>Daniel Hahn, author, translator and chair of the society’s management committee, agreed. “I think we all understand that the book business isn’t easy for anybody right now – well, nearly anybody – and that plenty of good publishers are struggling, too. But we’ve reached a point today where the professional author is under serious threat, and that’s not a state of affairs that is good for any of us – not for publishers, not for writers, and certainly not for readers and the wider culture,” he said. “We mustn’t allow ourselves to drift into a situation where only the already-wealthy can afford to be writers, and so it’s time to rebalance the scales a little.”</p> <p>Solomon said that the society is supported in its campaign by the <a href=\"http://rsliterature.org/\">Royal Society of Literature</a>, and by the <a href=\"http://www.alcs.co.uk/\">Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society</a>. The open letter is part of <a href=\"https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/guilds-letter-to-publishers-calls-for-real-change-to-book-contracts/\">an international call to action from authors’ groups around the world</a>, asking publishers to review their contract terms and treatment of authors. Solomon said that the <a href=\"http://www.publishers.org.uk/\">Publishers Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ipg.uk.com/\">Independent Publishers Guild</a> have agreed to meet the writers’ organisation to discuss the letter, and she will also be looking to meet with large and small publishers across the UK in the coming months.</p> <p>Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association, said this morning that while “publishers share the frustration of the author community that it is increasingly difficult for authors to make a decent living from their writing”, they “locate the principal source of this problem not in the contractual relations between publisher and author but in deeper market factors”. </p> <p>“With margins being squeezed across the whole supply chain, books are facing increasingly stiff competition from other media and entertainment sectors for consumers’ time, and there simply being more writers … the reasons for the decline in average author income are wide and varied,” said Mollet. “We look forward to continuing our discussions on these policy issues with the SoA and other author representative groups.”</p> <p>Independent Publishers Guild chief executive Bridget Shine said that authors were “central” to its members’ businesses. “As with any business model in any industry, it is problematic to attempt to impose blanket terms and conditions – our members operate in a huge variety of markets with complex variables, which naturally leads to different author terms from publisher to publisher,” said Shine. “But we are of course very happy to share the society’s concerns with IPG members via its open letter, and welcome all debate about the future direction of publishing and authors’ huge contribution to it.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhhq","wordcount":"1016","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bf396408ffe28abee8932e9a8d52ccbb14c966a1/0_0_4439_2665/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>New Society of Authors campaign joins international calls for fairer wages for writers, asking publishers to review how they treat and pay their authors</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/06/philip-pullman-society-of-authors-open-letter-fairer-terms-for-writers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/jan/06/philip-pullman-society-of-authors-open-letter-fairer-terms-for-writers","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"bf396408ffe28abee8932e9a8d52ccbb14c966a1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bf396408ffe28abee8932e9a8d52ccbb14c966a1/0_0_4439_2665/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Felix Clay\r+ 44 (0)7970 652 124\rfelixclay@blueyonder.co.uk\rwww.felixclay.com","picdarUrn":"GD*7120621","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/bf396408ffe28abee8932e9a8d52ccbb14c966a1","altText":"‘Serious changes are required’ … Philip Pullman.

finished “a giant proofread” of the book. “It’s not every speech, introduction or article I’ve written, but it’s all the speeches that seemed important, all the articles I was still proud of, all the introductions that seemed to be about something bigger than just telling people about the book or author they were going to read,” Gaiman wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

It was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/25/neil-gaiman-oscars-coraline\">first published by The Guardian</a> as “A nobody’s guide to the Oscars” and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://amandapalmer.bandcamp.com/track/the-view-from-the-cheap-seats-3\">was later included as a track</a> on an album released by Gaiman and Palmer in 2013, An Evening with Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amandapalmer/posts/10153529756538375\">On a post on her Facebook page</a> yesterday, Palmer said Gaiman had taken to “leaving his manuscripts in the linen closet” while looking after their child, as she returned to the recording studio for the first time since he was born.</p> <p>“As a feminist, the fact that famous-ass Neil Gaiman is happy to spend his time, as a human being and father (along with me and the other official two recording studio babysitters), cuddling, singing and distracting and juggling a three-month old baby around and trying to keep him from crying and fussing while she-with-the-boobs is two rooms away maniacally back at work, pounding on a piano and talking with engineers and string-arrangers, when he could be, oh, writing a book or something, or generally sticking with the old paradigm and aghast at the idea of doing any kind of childcare, especially in his wife’s workplace... I’m gonna say this is a point for team feminism,” Palmer wrote.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhgh","wordcount":"512","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/444e7c4c3bd8b79bb38efba9f9eb64309bf0a461/0_444_2000_1201/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Author

They need to do this because people who have wolves as pets and then get bored with them pass them on to wolf wilders to train them to be wild. The country is run by a general as the Tsar is too interested in his sick son to be bothered with running the country.</p> <p>Because the wolves that they have wilded start hunting livestock, the general gets angry and orders her to shoot any other wolves that get brought to her. When Feo is out wilding their latest wolf, she meets a young soldier, Ilya, and they become friends.</p> <p>The general finds out that they are disobeying his orders, makes sure the latest wolf is killed and then attacks their house and her mum is taken to prison. Feo, together with three wolves and Ilya, go on the run.

But the author Ishmael Beah believes these young survivors are vital to the country’s future","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Ishmael Beah listens intently as the group of boys sitting in a semi-circle talk about their experiences.</p> <p>“I had to carry a lot of ammunition and we had to walk barefoot. But I had a gun and I participated in battles,” says one.</p> <p>“I watched as my sister and mother were killed,” says another. “We were in the bush, we had no food, we were dying. I went with the fighters because I had no one to care for me and I wanted to help my people.”</p> <p>The boys are among 1,700 child soldiers newly released from the Cobra armed faction, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/south-sudan-child-soldiers-released-deal-government-and-rebels\">which is discharging up to 3,000 after signing a truce with the government of South Sudan</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.beahfound.org/about/ishmael-beah/\">Beah</a>, a former child soldier from Sierra Leone, is a best-selling author and advocate for children affected by war for the UN children’s agency, Unicef. He visited South Sudan to highlight the plight of the country’s young fighters.</p> <p>A tall boy in a blue T-shirt introduces himself as 15-year-old Zuagan Kaka and fixes Beah with an intense stare. “I know I don’t have to tell you what war is like because I know you have lived it.”</p> <p>Beah smiles at him reassuringly. “I do. And if you survive war you are already strong enough to overcome this part of your life.”</p> <p>Kaka smiles. “I know. I’m good at sciences. I don’t want to be a carpenter or mechanic.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"36e013bbeed9fbaa858839773654bc08f69b2c26\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/36e013bbeed9fbaa858839773654bc08f69b2c26/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Unicef child protection specialist speaks during a ceremony last March formalising the release of children from the Cobra faction in Jonglei state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Unicef child protection specialist speaks during a ceremony last March formalising the release of children from the Cobra faction in Jonglei state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare McKeever/Unicef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Realistically, though, those are the only options open to Kaka and the others here. They live in Pibor, in the east of South Sudan, where educational opportunities are extremely limited. Kaka is receiving medical support from Unicef, and has been placed on a vocational training programme. But in Beah’s view, offering such limited horizons for former child fighters may restrict the country’s ability to move to a peaceful future.</p> <p>“You have to have a special kind of intelligence and confidence to have survived such horrors. If someone wants to be a mechanic that’s one thing, but why are we limiting them to vocational training? Surely this is where the future leaders of the nation can be found? They’ve lived war, they never want to return to it. They can be future leaders and the key to peace.”</p> <p>Beah is proof that an early life blighted by fighting is not necessarily a barrier to greater things. Yet he made it to the US, was fostered and got a good education.</p> <p>“Yes, but it wasn’t just that,” he says. “I realised there were certain things I learned as a solider that I could use for education. One of them was discipline. I could read a book.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/12/south-sudan-child-soldiers-fighting-war\">South Sudan’s next generation in a hurry to fight | Hannah McNeish</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next day, while Beah is visiting another Unicef-supported school in Pibor where hundreds of former child soldiers are learning English, maths and social studies, a young man called Marco stands on a chair to speak and the room falls silent. He tells Beah that they are happy to be out of the army and grateful to be in school, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.unicef.org/southsudan/UNICEF_South_Sudan_SitRep_49_-_30_Dec_2014.pdf\">the quality is lacking</a> (pdf). “We need better teachers and we need books and nicer classrooms,” he says. The boys cheer.</p> <p>Beah meets Marco and some of the boys again the next day to play a game of football organised by Marco. At the field there are dozens of former child soldiers wearing colourful shirts and shorts, some with shoes, some without. Marco, 16, presides over the warm-up and selects the teams. </p> <p>“I was a regimental sergeant major,” he explains. “Logistics. I was in control of 50 people. Love of education forced me to come out. I want to be a doctor or a pilot so I can fly in medical supplies to people in rural areas. I was 12 when I joined the army. There were a lot of beatings and torture. I regret joining now.”</p> <p>Marco is the type of potential leader Beah says he is describing. “Why is it so surprising to people that a boy like Marco, just out of conflict, has thought through the needs of his country in such a detailed way?”</p> <p>While Beah’s zeal is laudable, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/28/south-sudan-civil-war-human-suffering-children-displaced-famine\">situation in South Sudan is dire</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0ef9be09f5f839b1845c4250b5aed07209ede3f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e0ef9be09f5f839b1845c4250b5aed07209ede3f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ishmael Beah talks to a group of children in Pibor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ishmael Beah talks to a group of children in Pibor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/Unicef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/27/south-sudan-peace-deal-greeted-with-quiet-optimism-by-humanitarian-world\">peace agreement</a> was signed in August, but conflict rages across several parts of the country, involving about 16,000 child soldiers.<strong> </strong>Since fighting broke out in December 2013, nearly <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Unicef-Advocate-Ishmael-Beah-witnesses-impact-of-conflict-on-children-in-South-Sudan/\">1,500 children have been killed and more than 900,000 internally displaced</a>, most of them out of the reach of aid agencies.</p> <p>Unicef estimates that 600,000 children need psychological support as a result of the atrocities they have witnessed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/28/south-sudan-civil-war-human-suffering-children-displaced-famine\">Families have been burned alive, girls raped and boys castrated</a>.</p> <p>For Beah, “urgent and serious political will” is needed to address the situation.</p> <p>“There are some armed factions refusing to give children back. But removing children is the best measure to keep peace on track and means these factions wouldn’t have as much power. I know these young men don’t want to be in war. It was the only choice they had in order to live.”</p> <p>As Beah says his goodbyes, another boy shakes his hand. </p> <p>“In the army I saw a lot of friends die. I would never go back to that life.

will swing my judgment of you","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Books, as I’m sure you all realise, make the perfect gifts. Firstly, as anyone who found themselves unwrapping a paperback can attest, they’re economically efficient: stick to paperbacks and you can furnish someone with a world entire for under a tenner. Secondly, they’re easy to wrap. Thirdly, and crucially, they’re a brilliant means of expressing regard: by matching your recipient with just the right book, you’re demonstrating how well you know them, and how much you care.</p> <p>The best book presents are those that say something about, and to, the person doing the opening; the acme of my own book-gifting career came when I gave my dad – a socialist with a geography degree – a copy of Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs and Steel for Christmas. Almost a decade later, he’s still finding new ways to work it into conversation.</p> <p>To give a book, then, is an unselfish, outward-looking act – but to share one is something quite different. The act of sharing a book you love is fraught with anxiety and risk: you are, in effect, deliberately creating a test situation for your share-ee, on which your long-term view of them will depend. The books you share say little about the person with whom you’re sharing them, beyond the fact that you view them as worthy of the test. These are the books that say something about you.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/03/best-crime-and-thriller-books-of-2015\">Best crime and thriller books of 2015</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first came across <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gaudy-night.html\">Dorothy L Sayers’ Gaudy Night</a> about a decade ago, when my ex-boyfriend’s father pressed a copy on me. “You’ll like this,” he said, pulling it off a bookshelf as we were leaving after a weekend’s visit. I’d never heard of Sayers before; I wasn’t much of a crime aficionado (I’m still not), and my acquaintance with Golden Age detective fiction to that point had been limited to the 1980s TV series of Miss Marple, which my grandma used to let me stay up to watch. When he gave me the book, therefore, I thanked him vaguely and forgot all about it until, halfway through the train journey home and in lieu of alternative entertainment (this was during the pre-smartphone era), I dug it out and cracked the spine.</p> <p>The book feels so fundamental to me, now, that I find it hard to cast my mind back to a time when I hadn’t read it, and harder still to explain what it’s about, because it seems to be about everything. It’s a novel about work and the moral value of work; the importance – indeed the necessity – of finding the job you’re fitted for and doing it to the very best of your abilities. It’s about truth, and the need, in a slippery, shifting world, to find the one true thing you’re willing to defend, no matter what the personal cost. It’s about friendship, and how it ebbs and flows as you yourself grow – or stop growing. It’s about writing: what it means to write well and how to do it. It’s about love and integrity, and the thought and work and consideration that must go into establishing and maintaining a relationship of equality and mutual respect. It’s about class and sex and society between the wars. And above all, it’s about the age-old question (which at the time of writing was a fresh, new one) of whether it’s possible for a woman to have it all: to have a life of the mind and of the heart, and to do equal honour to them both.</p> <p>All of which makes the book sound like very heavy weather – but it isn’t, not at all. Though it carries all of those things with it, Gaudy Night is also a cracking detective story: a locked-room mystery in which the room is the fictional Oxford women’s college of Shrewsbury, the suspects the college’s staff and senior members, and the crime not a nice, neat murder, but a spiteful, sticky jumble of vicious pranks and poison pen letters. The book is the 10th in Sayers’ series of novels featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, her aristocratic amateur sleuth, but the first to be told entirely from the point of view of Harriet Vane, herself an author of detective fiction. She was introduced in an earlier novel in which she was saved from the hangman’s noose by Lord Peter after being mistakenly charged with the murder of her former lover. Peter fell in love with her during the trial and proposed to her. But scared, scarred and aware that her gratitude to him would put any relationship on a profoundly unequal basis, she refused. She crops up again in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s9g4l\">Have His Carcase</a>, in which the pair find an easier footing as they solve a murder case together. But Gaudy Night marks a significant gear-change for the series, in terms of Harriet’s move to centre stage and the fact that, having liberated herself from the point of view of her hero, Sayers is also free to shrug off the constraints of efficiency and emotional absence imposed by the detective genre itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/21/we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle-by-shirley-jackson-a-house-of-ordinary-horror\">We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson – a house of ordinary horror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Harriet attempts to solve the crime that has set her old college by the ears, while grappling with her feelings for Peter and struggling with the possibility of introducing psychological realism into her own orderly and (metaphorically) bloodless crime novels, Sayers is busily doing the same. “You haven’t yet written the book you could write if you tried,” Peter says to Harriet halfway through the novel. “And you’ll get no peace until you do.” This is Sayers’ own attempt at fulfilling her potential as a writer – and the result is raw, provocative and deeply moving.</p> <p>Really, I messed things up by reading this book first out of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels. I wish now that I’d started at the beginning and built up to it, in order to feel its full impact in the context of the series. When I turned greedily to the earlier books I was disappointed. They’re clever and amusing and well-written, but in the wake of Gaudy Night they seemed to me to be depthless: all head, no heart. While the novel has its critics (Golden Age purists notoriously view Harriet as a Yoko Ono figure who lured Sayers away from the true path) and is, even to my eyes, not without flaws. The lazy assumptions around class are jarring, but it’s nevertheless the most honest, rigorous and robustly feminist interrogation of love and work that I’ve come across. I can think of few books that I love more.</p> <p>Over the years, I’ve been extremely selective about whom I’ve shared Gaudy Night with; the idea of someone I love responding to it in a lukewarm fashion is distressing. But by the same token, when it comes to people who really matter to me, I’m unable to keep it to myself. The stakes are high, but I need to know how they feel about it, so that I know how to feel about them. So please, before you comment, bear this in mind. I’ve shared this book with you, and like it or not, I’ll be judging you on what you say about it.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fcnd","wordcount":"1221","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8121d71af434b94d86bba051d8af4597d82d7e5a/0_472_1232_738/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>This is a mystery that encompasses large questions of life and love – and your verdict on the case will swing my judgment of you</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/18/do-you-like-to-give-and-receive-books-share-your-photos-stories-and-memories\">Guardian Witness: which books do you love to share?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/books/series/a-book-to-share\">Read more in our ‘A book to share’ series</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/06/gaudy-night-by-dorothy-l-sayers-a-weighty-novel-that-still-thrills","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/06/gaudy-night-by-dorothy-l-sayers-a-weighty-novel-that-still-thrills","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"8121d71af434b94d86bba051d8af4597d82d7e5a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8121d71af434b94d86bba051d8af4597d82d7e5a/0_472_1232_738/1000.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"PD*914901","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/8121d71af434b94d86bba051d8af4597d82d7e5a","suppliersReference":"PA*30679","altText":"Dorothy L Sayers.","caption":"Raw, provocative and deeply moving ...

He bubbles with adjectives such as “amazing” and “wild” and “lucky” for a blessed era – ours. Medical science, he says, can extend and improve human life as never before. The possibilities are limitless.</p> <p>“We’re at the point where there is a discovery every week that is transformative,” he says. “Our bodies are talking all the time. But now, with technology, for the first time we can listen in. And this is what is going to define these lucky years: listening.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://davidagus.com/\">Agus</a> listens to the human body closely. He is a research scientist, professor of medicine and engineering and a clinician whose patients include billionaires, rock stars and Hollywood royalty. He is also, like his late friend and patient Steve Jobs, an evangeliser for technology-driven progress, a gospel he spreads through mega-selling books and appearances on television and at powwows such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. His focus is not on gadgets but on how scientific breakthroughs can help us “edit our DNA”, adopt healthier lifestyles and customise medical treatment.</p> <p>“We don’t want people to die young of diseases like Alzheimer’s, heart disease and cancer. We need to delay and prevent them and we now have the technologies to do that. We can live until our ninth or 10th decade and then die of what we call old age, when there is general engineering failure.”</p> <p>The physician exudes Silicon Valley-style zeal to change the world. Diseases such as pancreatic cancer, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/21/steve-jobs-cancer-surgery-regret\">claimed Jobs’s life</a> in 2011 at the age of 56, affront him. “Steve asked me, ‘Why can’t you debug me like I debug a program?’” Agus believes the ability to do that, and much else, is within our grasp. All we need do is collate and heed insights from medical science. It is a heady prospect. Talking with Agus is like floating up into the balmy Los Angeles sky and wondering – hoping – he is right about the azure yonder.</p> <p>In a crowded field of celebrity doctors and wellness gurus, their advice ranging from common sense to kooky to perilous, the trim 50-year-old is an overachieving hybrid. He combines serious research with patient consultations, <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/david_agus_a_new_strategy_in_the_war_on_cancer?language=en\">TED talks</a>, tech entrepreneurship and spots on CBS with mega-selling books such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/end-of-illness.html\"><em>The End of Illness</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/short-guide-to-a-long-life.html\"><em>A Short Guide to a Long Life</em></a>.</p> <p>His latest, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360576/\"><em>The Lucky Years: How to Thrive in the Brave New World of Health</em></a>, published this month in the UK, carries endorsements from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/18/larry-ellison-oracle-billionaire-resigns-ceo\">Oracle’s Larry Ellison</a> (“an inspiring vision”) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/12/michael-dell-buys-back-pc-company-founded\">Dell Inc founder Michael Dell</a> (“It sometimes takes a genius to know the difference between what’s good and bad for us amid all the noise in health circles. Thanks, David Agus, for being that genius.”).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRxgDMSp9Gs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRxgDMSp9Gs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch David Agus’s TED talk, A New Strategy in the War Against Cancer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Amazon blurb for <em>The Lucky Years</em> boasts that it gives you “the keys to the new kingdom of wellness”. That’s a stretch. It reviews the latest research into disease and healthcare, taking in genes, drugs, diet, sleep and exercise, and breaks it down into bitesize recommendations. The techno-utopian tone hails a “golden age”, but says patients and physicians need to be savvy and learn how to crunch data, for example, to truly benefit.</p> <p>The scion of a professor emeritus of medicine and physiology, and a graduate of elite medical schools – Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins – Agus fires out advice in rapid, confident tones. Vitamins, detoxes and juices: bad. Aspirin, statins, earplugs and a Mediterranean diet: good.</p> <p>Such conclusions, he says, are not his opinion. “It’s the data.” During our interview, Agus cites about a dozen recent, varied studies, all pooling into a knowledge reservoir. In China, for instance, scientists used DNA-editing techniques to alter a gene in human embryos. Changing one letter among the 3bn forming an individual’s DNA code could, for example, stop a breast cancer gene passing on to a child.</p> <p>Researchers in Princeton and California dusted off a long-neglected, 1950s experiment – a Frankensteinish stitching of young and old rats together – and found that proteins in the blood of young individuals can activate dormant stem cells in older individuals. “The cure for disease is within us,” says Agus. “We now have the ability, through these proteins, once we isolate them, to potentially turn back on these stem cells.”</p> <p>Citing ethical and safety concerns, a biology summit of international scientists in Washington last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/03/gene-editing-summit-rules-out-ban-on-embryos-destined-to-become-people-dna-human\">decided it was too soon for clinical use of “germline editing”</a>, but left the door open for later use.</p> <p>Harnessing healthcare systems’ information troves will mark another huge advance, especially that of the NHS, a repository of centralised, cradle-to-grave knowledge, says Agus. “This is the era of big data and we all have the ability to be part of it.” Protecting patient confidentiality from prying by governments, employers or insurance companies is an issue, he concedes, but he believes the information must be shared. “The solution for many of the diseases we’re talking about is in the databanks of the NHS. It needs to be liberated.”</p> <p>To illustrate the explosion of data, he takes out his iPhone and opens a free app that measures his <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aliveecg/id579769143?mt=8\">heart’s electrical activity</a> through his fingertips. Another app, costing 79p, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vital-signs-camera-philips/id474433446?mt=8\">measures his breathing and pulse</a> by filming his face. “I can build up a record and email it to my doctor,” he says. “It’s a new world.”</p> <p>Agus was a geek focused solely on science in his youth, but his mentor, Andy Groves, the former CEO of Intel, who has battled prostate cancer, urged him to sharpen his communication skills. Moving to LA in 2000 reinforced the message. A Hollywood friend gave him a “great gift” – a focus group analysis. It taught him to allay suspicion of being a drug industry shill (he doesn’t receive a cent, he says), and to tone down references to high-powered patients, lest ordinary people assume such treatment is beyond humbler means.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a474c04d9f32d6b61adecadf2cc88d1891c3079\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6a474c04d9f32d6b61adecadf2cc88d1891c3079/0_0_3000_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs, friend and patient of David Agus: ‘He kicked himself that he took things to an extreme.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Jobs, friend and patient of David Agus: ‘He kicked himself that he took things to an extreme.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jobs, a marketing savant, changed the original title of Agus’s first book, What Is Health? “He said health is a bad word. It’s like chewing cardboard, people’s eyes glaze over. You need to put something positive, declarative.” <em>The End of Illness</em> duly topped the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. The Apple co-founder’s influence is also apparent in Agus’s outfit: black slacks and white dress shirt beneath a black sweater.</p> <p>Agus treated Jobs after he had abandoned his attempt to fight cancer with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jan/28/fruitarian-diet-land-you-hospital\">fruitarian diet</a> and embraced, too late, conventional medicine. “He kicked himself that he took things to an extreme. It’s empowering when you go on a diet. You think you’re doing something.” Agus pauses. “I unfortunately have to look people in the eyes several times a week and say I have no more drugs to treat your cancer. I don’t want to do that any more.”</p> <p>Agus thinks scientific advances have opened the door to a new era. But we’re not stepping through it because medical consensus plods slowly, cautiously, and the internet squawks with cranks and charlatans. So ordinary people hesitate, in want of a reliable guide.</p> <p>“With enough data, error goes away. But the data needs context. The internet is remarkable but there’s a lot of noise. Everybody’s saying everything. So in order to get normative behaviour change based on data, you need leadership. The reason I write books is to try to provide some of that leadership.”</p> <p>It’s a bold ambition reflected in his clinic’s wall hangings: quotes from Winston Churchill (“we shall fight on the beaches… we shall never surrender”) and Albert Einstein (“knowledge must continually be renewed by ceaseless effort…”), plus an image of the physician <a href=\"http://www.famousscientists.org/edward-anthony-jenner/\">Edward Jenner</a> giving a young boy, reputedly his son, a pioneering smallpox vaccination. “That changed the world,” says Agus.</p> <p>Not everyone is a fan. Gathering enough data until “error goes away” can sound like hubris. Some critics accuse Agus of getting ahead of the evidence in a media-friendly quest for clarity and directness. When in 2012 he bluntly warned an ABC News reporter, a test subject, that he was at risk of a heart attack, five doctors <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/12/david-agus-rules-to-live-longer/\">said he overstated the risk</a>.</p> <p>Seated in his office, Agus bats away the criticism, saying solid research grounds his conclusions. “I get to cheat. I know many of the studies years before they’re published.” If the data is not definitive, his conclusions reflect that, he says. But some things strike him as clear cut.</p> <p>“There’s a notion that vitamins mean life, and more is better, but the data don’t support it. In over 60 randomised studies of multivitamin versus placebo, none, zero, ever showed a benefit. Lots of side-effects but no benefits. We spend more on vitamin supplements in the United States than we do on all of medical research. There’s something wrong there.” Slick marketing and a yearning for quick fixes feed the industry, he laments. “It’s a crutch. When I say that, people get pissed off.”</p> <p>Agus strives to follow his own injunctions. Every day he takes a baby aspirin to lower the risk of cancer and heart disease and a statin to lower cholesterol and block inflammation. Agus shrugs off critiques from colleagues who say healthy people should not take statins. “Look at the data,” he says. He scorns detoxing and juiced fruits and vegetables. “Whenever you put them into a blender, or squeeze them out, they degrade right away because of the oxygen and light. So there is no nutritional value, there’s just sugar.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84de9aefb23aa64cbb21143d0ef3ef2c6d3702e5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/84de9aefb23aa64cbb21143d0ef3ef2c6d3702e5/0_0_4705_2821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Agus with the Observer’s Rory Carroll: ‘Ah!

You do have an abnormality. A cool one.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Smith for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Agus says fad diets don’t work. “There’s been a fad diet coming out every year or two for the past 50 years. If one was superior to another, we’d be doing it.” He advocates a Mediterranean diet with regular mealtimes – and moderation. For instance, no more than two glasses of red wine a night to avoid waking up a few hours later with a rebound surge of adrenaline. Three cups of coffee daily can have a health benefit, he says. “So I have two cups. But not after 11am because then I don’t sleep so well.”</p> <p>He values deep sleep. When watching TV in the evening he wears glasses to filter wavelengths that the brain confuses with sunlight. “It thinks, hey, I’ve got to be awake.” To sleep through his dog’s snoring Agus wears earplugs, a habit based partly on an English study that showed increasing neuron-cognitive decline the closer people lived to airports. “If you live near an airport, or in the middle of a city, it’s not that you’re doomed, it’s that you need to take steps to protect yourself.”</p> <p>Early to bed, he rises around 4am or 5am and exercises for an hour, alternating yoga, Pilates and tennis. “I don’t love yoga, but it works. My body needs it. When I skip it I feel it.” A tracking device “shocked” him over the daily hours spent sitting. “So I got a treadmill desk and try to do one walking meeting a day.”</p> <p>Instilling healthy habits in children, he concedes, is challenging. He lectured his kids in vain about chocolate milk affecting levels of insulin and cortisol, a steroid hormone. Then they watched Jamie Oliver fill a bus with sand to show how much sugar in the form of flavoured milk LA children consume weekly. “The next day they stopped drinking chocolate milk,” marvels Agus. “He knew how to speak their language.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/11/-sp-live-forever-extend-life-calico-google-longevity\">Live forever: Scientists say they’ll extend life ‘well beyond 120’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the interview, I supplied blood and urine samples so Hollywood’s favourite physician could analyse my results.

It means when you’re stressed you don’t conjugate bilirubin and degrade it well. Classically, people like that, when they have a stressful situation, the whites of their eyes turn yellow.”</p> <p>This is awesome?</p> <p>Agus nods and smiles. “There’s no harm to the body.”</p> <p>I’m not sure about awesome, but sort of fathom his enthusiasm.

The key points of this regime are…</strong></p> <p>■ Measure your blood pressure twice daily using a smartphone device. Make a note of how you are feeling when you take these readings.</p> <p>■ To understand the genetic risks to your health, investigate your family’s medical history for causes of death. Look for contributory lifestyle factors such as smoking, poor diet, or any mental health problems.</p> <p>■ In as much detail as possible, make a journal of your eating habits. Record how you feel in the hours immediately after eating.</p> <p>■ Make a note of any exercise you do.</p> <p>■ List all the medication and supplements you take and the reasons for doing so.</p> <p>■ Record any unexplained symptoms you experience.</p> <p>■ Make a note of how you feel each day – depressed, cheerful, stressed etc.</p> <p>■ Document your sleep schedule: the quality, the quantity, whether you dream or not, what you do before sleeping.</p> <p>■ Log the time of your peak and lowest energy levels each day.</p> <p>■ Overlay all this information and look for patterns. Do certain foods lead to changes in your mood, energy or sleep? Does the time of day that you exercise affect the quality of your sleep? Test these observations by changing your behaviour and noting what the result is.</p> <p>■ Ask your doctor to test your cholesterol, CRP (C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation in the body), CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel, a measure of liver and kidney function, as well as conditions such as diabetes) and hemoglobin A1C (your average blood sugar level).</p> <p>■ Discuss the results with your doctor.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fxc5","wordcount":"2379","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f4b3c3fd59e455ed49d341df2b492abb5da29b45/0_0_5184_3109/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-24T23:37:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Listening to our bodies and recording and analysing the results is more beneficial than smoothies or vitamins, says the author and physician who counted Steve Jobs among his patients.

shepherds in the Shimshal region of Pakistan are being menaced by a demigod, until the superheroes show up. Blue-faced baddie and innocent pastoral types exchange the usual banter: “You are all crushed by your hubris and ignorance.” “Help us, Allah …”<br /></p> <p>As is the accepted format, the dialogue is enclosed within angled brackets to show it is translated speech; however, in this case, the editor’s note in <a href=\"http://www.dccomics.com/comics/superman-wonder-woman-2013/supermanwonder-woman-annual-2\">Superman/Wonder Woman Annual #2</a>, released last week by DC comics, tells us the dialogue is “all translated from Pakistanian” – a language as non-existent as Superman’s native Kryptonian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/thekarachikid/statuses/684242379407134720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Marvel\">@Marvel</a> is winning over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DCComics\">@DCComics</a> - the latter thinks we speak Pakistanian. h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/takhalus\">@takhalus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xzvx8VccS1\">pic.twitter.com/xzvx8VccS1</a></p>&mdash; Khaver Siddiqi (@thekarachikid) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thekarachikid/status/684242379407134720\">January 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The caption was met with derision and glee on social media. Pakistani writer Khaver Siddiqi tweeted: “Here’s why @Marvel is winning over @DCComics – the latter thinks we speak Pakistanian”, referring to Marvel Comics having a Pakistani-American superhero, <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)\">Ms Marvel</a>.</p> <p>“You know, I’m not offended personally,” Siddiqi told the Guardian. “But when you have such a large operation and one Google search ruins your story? That offends me more.”</p> <p>Pakistan’s official national language is Urdu, though a huge number of people speak Punjabi. English was <a href=\"http://time.com/3975587/pakistan-english-urdu/\">officially dropped last year as an official language</a>. There are more than a dozen regional variations and languages – none of them called Pakistanian.</p> <p> Karachi-based radio host and book reviewer Mahvesh Murad <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahveshm/status/684243007953092608\">tweeted</a>: “PAKISTANIAN! Fantastic. Someone teach me that too.”</p> <p>Zawad Iftikhar wrote: “Could you help me with my quest to learn ‘PAKISTANIAN’? Can’t find one school that offers it. #DCComics #Pakistanian” while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whyrus_/status/684350489526317057\">@whyrus_ tweeted</a>: “According to DC comics, Pakistan’s language is Pakistanian. DC comics do have a solid command over American, I must say.”</p> <p>Some people directed their messages at the Twitter account of the comic’s editor, Andrew Marino, with one user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahnoorie/status/684287320493813763?lang=en\">sending the tongue-in-cheek tweet</a>: “Hey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GLMarino?lang=en\">@GLMarino</a>, any editor worth his salt would know: it’s called *Pakistanese*.”</p> <p>“You wonder, with the size of the Superman dynasty, the DC Comics empire, the cultural impact that both have made to the world, why no one thought to Google ‘what language do they speak in Pakistan?’” London-based writer and diversity campaigner Nikesh Shukla told the Guardian.</p> <p>“Either it’s lazy, which is troubling, or it’s ignorant, which is troubling, or it’s on purpose. Which is troubling. But then again, Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, still has chai tea on the menu, which, as we all know, means tea tea. Words fail me. As they did DC.”</p> <p>DC Entertainment told the Guardian it would not be commenting on the

Twelve of the 20 species were discovered within a three-week period in 2013 by researchers James Shelley and Matthew Le Feuvre when they accessed some of Australia’s most remote rivers by helicopter. </p> <p>Tim Winton was one of two species discovered within five minutes of reaching the Prince Regent River by helicopter. Le Feuvre said: “We could see from the surface of the river there were at least two new species that weren’t in the field guide. That’s how different they were. You don’t need to get them in your hand, they just jump out at you.”</p> <p>The fish is endemic to the area, and is golden coloured on the top and silver on the bottom. “It’s a very beautiful looking fish with a very classic fish shape,” Le Feuvre said. </p> <p>They thought it would be a “good gesture” to name the fish after the writer. “He’s been a champion of conservation in the Kimberley and aquatic environments,” Le Feuvre said. “And he’s a very famous Western Australian as well.”</p> <p>Winton called the naming a “great honour” in <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4382050.htm\">an interview with the ABC</a>. “When I first heard about this little fish, you know, the greenie in me thought, ‘Well, I wonder what kind of fish it is and I wonder what its habits are and what its habitat is.’ Then the redneck in me thought, ‘Well, I wonder what it tastes like?’”</p> <p>The new species fall within three categories: 16 Terapontidae (grunters), three Eleotridae (gudgeons) and one Atherinidae (hardy heads). </p> <p>The others have not yet been named, but Le Feuvre said they would be given Latin scientific names and the scientists were also working with local Indigenous communities – for whom the fish were once or continued to be important food sources – to find appropriate common names.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0cca961b11c83ea0ef85c0515ea26f863f4257a7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0cca961b11c83ea0ef85c0515ea26f863f4257a7/0_106_1599_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Le Feuvre in the Kimberley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Le Feuvre in the Kimberley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Shelley/Matthew Le Feuvre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Kimberley is among the least researched areas of Australia, due to its remoteness. Le Feuvre said the fish discovered were likely to just be the “tip of the iceberg”. “If you begin to look at amphibians and invertebrates – who knows what the actual diversity of northern Australia aquatic ecosystems actually is.”</p> <p> No fish species in the Kimberley, one of Australia’s most pristine regions, were listed for conservation, partly due to the lack of scientific knowledge around the area. “You can’t conserve what you don’t know exists,” Le Feuvre said.</p> <p>He said conservation listing tended to be “reactive, rather than proactive” and added, “there is an opportunity for proactive conservation in the Kimberley and get really good management plans in place before development begins”. Threats to the Kimberley include large-scale agriculture, mining and climate change.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhcm","wordcount":"558","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e4a52169a0dea23cee0fe51e574d5f18af72d3d5/112_0_1284_771/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-09T07:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The ‘very beautiful’ gold and silver coloured grunter is one of 20 newly-identified fish species from the remote Kimberley in Western Australia </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/06/fish-called-tim-winton-scientists-name-new-species-after-australia-novelist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/06/fish-called-tim-winton-scientists-name-new-species-after-australia-novelist","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"e4a52169a0dea23cee0fe51e574d5f18af72d3d5","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e4a52169a0dea23cee0fe51e574d5f18af72d3d5/112_0_1284_771/1000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/e4a52169a0dea23cee0fe51e574d5f18af72d3d5","altText":"Tim Winton, a newly identified fish species named after the best-selling Western Australian writer.

It tells the story of a young Iranian-American musician on the make in 21st-century New York, pursuing his dream of art through a haze of drugs, alcohol, casual sex and intermittent poverty. The book would be gripping and poignant in any circumstances, but what doubles its power for the reader is knowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/29/ali-eskandarian-iranian-punk-beat-novel-golden-years\" title=\"\">the fate of Eskandarian himself</a>. In November 2013, the author was shot and killed in an apartment in Brooklyn, along with two members of the punk band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/12/yellow-dogs-band-dissident-iran-rockers-killed\" title=\"\">Yellow Dogs</a>, by a fellow musician who bore a grudge. The killer then took his own life. All four men were exiles from Iran.</p> <p>At the time he died, Eskandarian was in his mid 30s. He’d been clinging on to the lower rungs of the ladder of the US music industry for more than a decade. <em>Golden Years</em> is the manuscript he was working on in the last years of his life. It’s a beat novel, which demands to be compared with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac\" title=\"\">Jack Kerouac</a>’s <em>On the Road</em>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/huntersthompson\" title=\"\">Hunter S Thompson</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/interactive/2013/may/18/ralph-steadman-fear-loathing-las-vegas-illustrated\" title=\"\"><em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jay-mcinerney\" title=\"\">Jay McInerney</a>’s <em>Bright Lights, Big City</em>. But while the book is billed as fiction, its protagonist, Ali, can barely be separated from Eskandarian by the width of a guitar string.</p> <p>In a series of chatty and frank vignettes, the novel tells the story of Ali’s childhood in Iran, his emigration to America and subsequent career in an industry in which “career” is generally a shape imposed in restrospect on a succession of crises. Between shoestring tours, we find our hero waiting tables, working cash-in-hand in New York’s garment district and taking orders in a Dallas pancake restaurant.</p> <p>As a struggling musician, Ali occupies a strange bohemian wormhole in which he’s taking cocaine with a billionaire in one paragraph and too broke to eat the next. Erudite, rootless, sensitive, smarting from the indignities of poverty and being an also-ran in a society that worships success, Ali clings to his faith that the pursuit of art is its own justification. There’s something both touching and naive about his refusal to compromise. The willed blindness to convention that it takes for him to stay on his tightrope makes him sometimes resemble a more talented version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/01/david-mitchell-robert-webb-on-peep-show-we-just-wanted-to-milk-it-interview\" title=\"\">Jeremy, the Robert Webb character in <em>Peep Show</em></a>. While doing a lowly job at an ad agency to pay the rent, he fails to get a raise out of his boss and muses: “He must still be pissed off about that email I sent out condemning our company for doing that commercial for a giant agricultural biotechnology corporation.” Ali’s declaration that he is “done with cocaine” is not the dawn of sobriety but a protest at the drug’s debased quality. Cocaine is just “baking soda and baby powder. So for now it’s amphetamines in pill form, alprazolam, marijuana and booze. No more tramadol either since I set my hair on fire on a lit candle.”</p> <p>The constants in Ali’s life are sex and drugs. About rock’n’roll he’s oddly reticent – it’s a shame that he writes so little about performing and his relationship with music as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuFVtv_u3Pw\" title=\"\">videos of Eskandarian reveal a man of palpable charisma and undoubted talent</a>. I can only suppose that by the time he began writing the novel, he was so disenchanted with the music industry that he couldn’t bear to dwell on it. But much that seems inexplicable from the book – his attractiveness to women, his simmering sense of indignation, his compulsioun to sustain his self-esteem with drugs and sexual conquests – is immediately understandable when you see him playing his heart out to a noisy and distracted audience.</p> <p>His experiences recall those of another cold and penniless musician: the title character of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers\" title=\"\">the Coen brothers</a>’ film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-llewyn-davis\" title=\"\"><em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em></a>, who misses out on being the next <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan</a> for reasons that have more to do with the inscrutable rhythms of the universe than his difficult personality or any shortage of talent.</p> <p>As so often with posthumous work, there is a strange sense of foreshadowing throughout. Ali seems aware that the sand is running out of the hourglass. He recognises that he’s the oldest man on the dance floor and is belatedly acquiring insight into his own predicament: “All my problems and roamings and ramblings can be boiled down to addiction and financial trouble.” There’s a tender and avuncular note in his relationship with the younger Iranian musicians for whom he testifies and interprets at their asylum hearings.</p> <p>The book closes with Ali redoubling his commitment to the life he has chosen, despite the unravelling of another relationship, and no relief in sight to his financial problems. Ahead seems to lie a fork in the road: one path leading towards the fading dream of artistic recognition, the other to the compromises of respectability. Actually, what awaits is stranger and more sudden. From our vantage point, Ali’s fascination with reincarnation and his cosmic musings acquire an eerie heft, and his stubborn fidelity to his art is granted a bittersweet vindication.</p> <p>• Marcel Theroux’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/strange-bodies-2.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Strange Bodies</em></a> is published by Faber.

I’ve seen others thrown off balance by what look like insignificant disruptions: the butterfly’s wing that causes a brainstorm. We cannot expect a system as complex as the human mind to respond in predictable or linear ways. We tend to deploy vast psychological resources to prevent ourselves from changing: sometimes wisely, when despair or madness loom; sometimes foolishly. For fear of the tempest, we can deprive ourselves of experience, and deprive others of the changes we need to make to become better people.</p> <p>Knowing all this, I’m still astonished by how small a thing it was that shaped my life. In August, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/24/george-monbiot-book-changed-me-help-me-trace-story-political-awakening\" title=\"\">I wrote an article for the Guardian’s “A book that changed me” series</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/24/george-monbiot-book-changed-me-help-me-trace-story-political-awakening\" title=\"\">My contribution</a> was peculiar in that I didn’t have a title. I had found the book when I was eight, in a dusty box in my boarding school’s sanatorium, and returned to it whenever I fell ill. It was the first countervailing influence in a childhood surrounded by conservative thought and Conservative politics, and it had a profound effect on me. I described the book briefly and – it turns out – not very accurately. And I asked the readers for help.</p> <p>The result was the internet at its best, and its worst. Many readers came forward with suggestions, and others generously went to some lengths to find it. Some people recommended fascinating books that had changed their own lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/24/george-monbiot-book-changed-me-help-me-trace-story-political-awakening\">Help me trace the book that prompted my political awakening | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same comment thread was flooded by a great tide of vitriol along these lines: how dare you have leftwing views/tell us about your life/presume to exist after attending a private school?</p> <p>Well, the thing about childhood is that you don’t control it: it is simply what surrounds you. To attack someone for their origins is no more rational than attacking someone for their gender, height or colour of skin.</p> <p>We could wait until we have been reincarnated into the appropriate socioeconomic class, or we can make the most of the life we have, using it as far as possible to do good and confront harm. The left would be a bleaker place without thinkers from privileged backgrounds. You could disown the likes of George Orwell, Tony Benn, Peter Kropotkin, Friedrich Engels, Elizabeth Fry, Leo Tolstoy, William Morris, Beatrice Webb, Mahatma Gandhi, Alexandra Kollontai, Bertrand Russell, Vera Brittain, Clement Attlee, William Beveridge, Franklin Roosevelt, Paul Foot and Millicent Fawcett because they came from the wrong place. Or you could judge a person by what they do rather than by how they were born.</p> <p>But to return to the main point, I owe a big apology to some of the readers. Quite early in the thread, several people, I now discover, correctly identified the book. But when I looked at the cover image and other illustrations I found online, they triggered no recognition.</p> <p>So people continued searching. Only when, after the comments closed, someone sent me a photo of a particular page did my memory suddenly flare into life.</p> <p>It was a book called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6827948-paolo-and-panetto\" title=\"\">Paolo and Panetto</a> by the exiled Austrian writer <a href=\"http://childrensandillustratedbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/bettina-ehrlich-authorillustrator-in.html\" title=\"\">Bettina Ehrlich</a>, now long out of print. I ordered an old copy. As soon as I handled it and smelt it, a wave of confused feeling crashed over me. All at once, I felt the joy of its discovery, the intrigue and absorption with which I first read it, and the misery of lying in a cheerless sick bay far from anyone I loved. As if to exorcise that ghost, rather than read it alone I curled up with my three-year-old and read it to her. She loved it as much as I had done.</p> <p>Two things struck me. The first was the patchiness of my memory. While I had recalled the bare bones of the story, I had collapsed two of the leading characters into one, excising the most interesting person – the young god Pan – from the narrative. In my memory, a spoilt child from a plush apartment met another boy on the streets picking up fag ends at night. This boy led him into the countryside and introduced him to unfamiliar freedoms. But in the original, it was a girl whom the rich boy met on the street. Through her he met Pan (or Panetto), who took him into the fields and woods. This reminded me of how untrustworthy our convictions are. We use our imagination to fill gaps of which we are unaware. We are unreliable witnesses to ourselves.</p> <p>The second realisation was that the story was milder than I had remembered. In my mind, it had become a radical commentary on inequality, perhaps written by an Italian communist. But the book wears its politics lightly. At the beginning, the spoilt child and the ragged girl explore the stark contrasts between their lives. This theme is then dropped until the end, when Paolo throws his father’s cigarettes out of the window for the street children to collect.</p> <p>That’s all there is: a privileged but neglected boy steps out of his insulated world, encounters a child living in poverty and seeks to redistribute a tiny fraction of his family’s wealth. It was this tremor of a butterfly’s wing that began a process that was to change my life.</p> <p>It was not, of course, the only event. Hundreds of later influences helped to shape my mind, and continue to do so. I hope the process never stops. For me, living a full life means being open to experience and persuasion, experimenting endlessly with new arguments and knowledge, risking ridicule by testing new ideas. The thought of descending into static respectability appals me.</p> <p>Dante was right. The inner circle of hell is a place where nothing changes, where life is frozen into immobility, where no one can change their destiny. When people claim that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, or that a leopard can’t change its spots, they shut themselves out of life.</p> <p>To inherit social position, wealth and opportunities: this is bad enough in a society with democratic pretensions. To inherit ideas and framings as well is to renounce not only intellectual honesty, but also much of our humanity.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fgqt","wordcount":"1048","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6cc4c953cc70a65cb685db0aac439f5c639d7b5/0_0_2702_1622/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-09T07:00:11Z","standfirst":"<p>Despite a conservative upbringing I’ve been open to radical ideas.

It’s not easy to narrow down a list of must-reads to just six, but we’ve done our best. Please add your own recommendations in the comments below.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <h2>1. <strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/274921/s/extreme-centre/\">The Extreme Centre: A Warning</a> by Tariq Ali (2015)</strong></h2> <p>It’s not the extreme left or extreme right we should be concerned about, argues Ali, but the inertia at the extreme centre. Read this critique of the “indistinguishable political elite” that thrives at the heart of the British political system and you – like Ali – will be seeking out alternatives to neoliberal politics.</p> <h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/big-short.html\">The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine</a> by </strong><strong>Michael Lewis (2010) </strong></h2> <p>Lewis’s tale of three small hedge fund managers and a bond salesman who bet against the banking system just before the biggest credit bubble in history burst – and made a killing – is a fascinating insight into the dark side of Wall Street and the deception that led to the financial crash of 2008.</p> <p>The book has been turned into a film directed and co-written by Adam McKay, which comes out in the UK on 22 January 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Big Short trailer\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HkbSbwEPNc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dispossessed.html\">The Dispossessed</a> by Ursula Le Guin (1974)</strong></h2> <p>Revolutionaries have fled the planet Urras, which is mired in poverty and ruled by an exploitative wealthy class, and have built themselves a new world on the planet Annares. At the heart of Annares’ anarchist society is the principle of sharing. But progress on the planet is stalling and all is not well. It might have been written more than 40 years ago, but that doesn’t stop this science fiction classic from exploring issues acutely relevant to us today.</p> <h2>4. <strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/316569/\">Postcapitalism</a> by Paul Mason</strong><strong> (2015)</strong></h2> <p>Capitalism may have undergone significant changes over the past two centuries, but with every cycle of boom and bust it has emerged stronger. Not any more, argues Paul Mason, who believes information technology is heralding a post-capitalist era. Read this excellent insight into the coming wave of automation and why it will revolutionise the way we live and work today.</p> <h2>5. <strong><a href=\"http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/refusal-of-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">Refusal of Work: The Theory and Practice of Resistance to Work</a> by David Frayne (2015)</strong></h2> <p>A perfect partner to Paul Mason’s Postcapitalism, David Frayne scrutinises the emergence of a working culture that sees some condemned to work harder than ever while others must cope with unemployment or underemployment. By exploring the motivations of those who resist the nine-to-five, Frayne explores the world of work that props up present-day capitalism.</p> <h2>6. <strong><a href=\"http://www.versobooks.com/books/1802-capitalism-a-ghost-story\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capitalism: A Ghost Story</a> by Arundhati Roy (2014)</strong></h2> <p>Man Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy makes the case that India answers to a handful of megacorporations that run the country. In the era of what Roy calls “the privatization of everything”, these companies have made the Indian economy one of the fastest growing in the world. There’s only one problem – they exploit everything and everyone in its wake. “It’s a dream come true for businessmen – to be able to sell what they don’t have to buy,” writes Roy.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f62h","wordcount":"570","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9991804cb88616de655fa34ea8068ce032da50bd/0_233_4630_2779/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>From

a long tradition of writers, from Chaucer to Dickens","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When George RR Martin announced this weekend that <a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html\">he still hadn’t finished the sixth book</a> in A Song of Ice and Fire, the reaction took two broad themes. One, as we chronicled here, saw fans of the books <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/04/george-rr-martin-support-deadline-game-of-thrones-winds-of-winter-a-song-of-ice-and-fire\">being broadly supportive</a> of his slowness and evident agony over the same. The competing attitude was more usually subtly expressed, surfacing in aggregated news stories that observed that Martin might become “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones/\">less relevant</a>” to the series if he did not catch up to the television show soon.</p> <p><em>Get off the pot, old man</em>, went the not-so-subtle subtext of such stories. His problem to them seems unfathomable. The man now has all the money and time in the world, and yet he can’t be bothered to produce this book? To them, the statistics speak for themselves. “In the four years from 1996 to 2000 he published three books; in the 15 years since he’s published part of one,” <a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/grrm-has-no-pages-1750057530\">wrote Tim Marchman at Deadspin</a>, in a piece published a few days before Martin’s admission. Plainly, this line of thinking held, Martin is physically and intellectually capable of producing faster. Does he ever plan on finishing the thing, before he dies?</p> <p>Well, the muse doesn’t quite work like that, most writers would cluck. In fact, Martin is just another in a long and sometimes highly literary line of authors who have conceived grand projects and ultimately can’t finish their work. Both Chaucer’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/chaucer-canterbury-tales-2012-multimedia\">The Canterbury Tales</a> and Spenser’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/19/poem-week-faerie-queene-edmund-spenser\">The Faerie Queene</a> are, for example, technically unfinished. Those two examples would suggest, actually, that leaving a grand-scale creative project unfinished at your death is actually a mark of greatness. Not that Martin is dead yet.</p> <p>Things get worse when your fame is not posthumous, of course. Dickens – the literary patriarch of popular serials – was lucky that he could crank out copy for most of his life without suffering writers’ block. (The one exception was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-dombey-son\">Dombey and Son</a>, but there his interruptions were all of a personal nature, the endless illnesses of his extended family.) Dickens always preferred to neglect his family rather than his fans, as you’ll learn from just about any book on him published after about 1935. </p> <p>Still, he died mid-novel, just a few months after beginning to publish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/24/patricia-cornwell-solves-mystery-of-edwin-drood-kay-scarpetta-charles-dickens\">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</a> in serial in 1870. At the time of his death, Dickens had completed more installations than he’d published, but not yet the entire series. As a result we don’t actually know who the killer is in Drood, having only speculation and guesses. Thus followed a century of devoted fans guessing the answer for various stagings and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/jan/06/edwin-drood-dickens-mystery-solved\">BBC television productions</a>. </p> <p>So obsessed were some prominent Dickens fans with the outcome of Drood that in 1914, the Dickens Fellowship staged a full mock trial of one of the suspects. (Mindful of spoilers, I shall not here reveal the name of the defendant or the outcome of the trial.) <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gk-chesterton\">GK Chesterton </a>acted as judge, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/bernardshaw\">George Bernard Shaw</a> as foreman of a jury of fellow writers that included the likes of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/05/archive-1925-chesterton-belloc-review\">Hilaire Belloc</a>. Yet none of this cultural ephemera threatened to eclipse Dickens’ involvement in the story, nor make him “less relevant” to it in the first place. </p> <p>Granted, Martin has made things more complicated for himself by handing the stories over to HBO, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/09/game-of-thrones-season-five-book-adaptations\">creating a competing cultural product</a> in a time when far more people probably watch prestige television than read books. (Though one longs for a study about that, actually.) That said, the existence of an energetic Dickens fandom, one which long before the era of snarky users of internet message boards found speculating about his books delightful, suggests that authors are always running against a couple of pressures: mortality being one, but the appetite of loyal readers another, an appetite which can grow so all-consuming </p> <p>But perhaps reasonable people can disagree over the appropriateness of comparing Martin to Dickens. A closer analogue might be the case of <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Wheel-Of-Time-Author-Robert-Jordan-Dies-6375.html\">Robert Jordan</a>, a former military man from North Carolina who wrote a series of bestselling fantasy novels, inflected by the author’s personal interest in ancient history, called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/17/wheel-of-time-hugo-award-tolkien-robert-jordan\">The Wheel of Time</a>. (I haven’t read them so shan’t attempt to summarize with any authority, but suffice to say there seems to be lots of Dark Forces and channeling involved. And a large wheel.)</p> <p>Whatever their merits, these books were at the top of the lists all through the 1990s and have a devoted following. Yet Jordan, like Martin, saw his project spiral out of control, from a six-book original plan to a 12-book actual one. When he tried to take time out from the project to do other things, online fan communities bristled about it. Then, as he was working on the 12th book, in 2006, he was diagnosed with cancer and died within months. He had assured his fans, though, that he was leaving plot-prescribing notes so that the books could be finished by someone else. His widow chose a young novelist named Brandon Sanderson to write the books.</p> <p>Sanderson was chosen in part because he was a big fan. “I’ll be perfectly honest: when I heard the news [of his death], my first thought was of the big loss of someone extraordinary,” Sanderson <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/03/entertainment/et-wheel3\">told the LA Times back in 2008</a>. “My second thought was … he was working on the last book, would we ever get to see it?” In the world of fantasy and science fiction, heavily reliant on serialized work, this was seen as a heavy responsibility, of course. But they were still greeted (Sanderson published the last book in three instalments, ending in 2013) as the work of Robert Jordan.</p> <p>Martin may, as such, take succor. David Benioff and DB Weiss, the producers of the television show, may be ahead of him, story-wise. But those characters and events will always be his.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fh25","wordcount":"986","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ae51a4396c79ab39a3e1e4e6e1d49fd593e8ff58/0_251_5760_3457/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-08T17:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The

There is also a bar stool and flip-down counter, ideal for enjoying a quiet coffee (mug visible). </p> <p>No details are added about how the crew coped with the reduction to their living space – not only from this domestic addition, but the presumably enlarged sleeping quarters required following the union of Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and the former Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbcabeed8c6c5bd2f85e1ec1dfe6a7061b988273\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dbcabeed8c6c5bd2f85e1ec1dfe6a7061b988273/0_0_893_536/500.jpg\" alt=\"‘It was an awkward attempt at making Han’s rusty, decrepit home a bit more welcoming’ … a detail from Star Wars: The Force Awakens Incredible Cross-Sections.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It was an awkward attempt at making Han’s rusty, decrepit home a bit more welcoming’ … a detail from Star Wars: The Force Awakens Incredible Cross-Sections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DK Children</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://jasonfry.tumblr.com/day/2016/01/03\">Writing on Tumbr</a>, the book’s author Jason Fry says the thinking behind the renovation was not that Leia “would obviously need a kitchen to potter around in, or feel the instinct to hang up her blaster and start cooking for her new husband and his Wookiee pal”. Rather, he says, the idea was that such an improvement would be necessary to cater for Leia’s culinary tastes. “The galley isn’t there for Leia to cook in – it’s there so someone else could use it to make something that Leia might want to eat.” </p> <p>He continues: “Leia’s a military leader, so I don’t see her as finicky. But she grew up as a member of the royal house of Alderaan and served in the Imperial Senate. Those months eating Corellian TV dinners and reheated Wookiee goulash on the Falcon had to rankle – and I imagined that later they’d become a humorous bone of contention between her and Han.”</p> <p>Fry reveals early Falcon plans did include a small kitchen, which he took the opportunity of restoring when it was felt the new film would required some adaptation to the ship so that Chewie could convalesce. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a gift from Han meant as a humorous make-do for months of terrible food, and an awkward attempt at making his rusty, decrepit home a bit more welcoming. But I always imagined Chewie would be the one doing the cooking – something about that image strikes me as funny. Or perhaps Han bought the galaxy’s grouchiest food-preparation droid, who turned out to have glitchy programming anyway.</p> <p>I don’t know, maybe Leia Organa’s a master chef. But I didn’t imagine her doing anything in the new galley beyond making herself the occasional cup of space coffee. After all, she would have been too busy saving the damn galaxy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Star Wars: The Force Awakens is on course to become the most successful film of all time at the box office. But the reception to its spin-off merchandise has been bumpier.

‘census’ to mark 75th anniversary of poetry collection","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>A quest to find as many as possible of the 1,000 hand-numbered copies of the great US poet Theodore Roethke’s debut collection, Open House, has been launched to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the work’s publication.</p> <p>The Theodore Roethke Home museum in Saginaw, Michigan, is describing the project as a census, and is asking anyone who owns one of the 1,000 first editions to get in touch. “The fact that each copy of Open House is hand-numbered gives each a unique personality. We’d like to hear about the books from their owners and what Roethke poem most resonates with them,” it said as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FriendsOfTheodoreRoethke\">it launched the search on Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Fine Books &amp; Collections magazine, <a href=\"http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine_books_blog/2015/12/theodore-roethke-museum-seeks-owners-of-open-house.phtml\">which first reported the project</a>, said the museum would be featuring a story a week about Open House over the next year, to mark 75 years since Roethke’s debut was first published to largely positive reviews.</p> <p>In his biography of the award-winning writer, described by James Dickey as “the greatest poet this country has yet produced”, Allan Seager quotes WH Auden’s write-up of the collection. “Mr Roethke is instantly recognisable as a good poet,” wrote Auden in the Saturday Review of Literature. “Many people have the experience of feeling physically soiled and humiliated by life; some quickly put it out of their minds, others gloat narcissistically on its unimportant details; but both to remember and to transform the humiliation into something beautiful, as Mr Roethke does, is rare. Every one of the lyrics in this book, whether serious or light, shares the same kind of ordered sensibility: Open House is completely successful.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/open-house-2/\">In the poem Open House</a>, Roethke wrote: </p> <p>“My secrets cry aloud. <br tabindex=\"-1\" />I have no need for tongue.<br tabindex=\"-1\" />My heart keeps open house,<br tabindex=\"-1\" />My doors are widely swung.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/18/quiz-2015-in-books-how-closely-were-you-reading\">Quiz: 2015 in books – how closely were you reading?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The collection, published in 1941, took Roethke 10 years to write. He would go on to win the Pulitzer in 1954 for The Waking, and also won two US National book awards.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Mike Kolleth, vice president of the museum, said the project had been inspired by “scholarly efforts to track and document the Shakespeare First Folios and the 560 first and second editions of Copernicus’s De revolutionibus orbium coelestium.</p> <p>“In both of those cases, the bibliographic information gleaned was interesting but the people and the stories behind the copies are fascinating,” he said. “Open House clearly doesn’t rise to the level of import of those two world-changing books; we absolutely understand that. This is more about storytelling than scholarship. But with the networking power of the internet at our disposal and the fact that all copies of the book are hand-numbered, we thought a census would be a great way to bring readers together to discuss Roethke’s poetry and learn where the books ended up.”</p> <p>Kolleth admitted that the census was unlikely to be completely successful. “We can’t find them all – frankly they are not all there to find anymore. Time takes its toll. But we’ll give it our best and see how the numbers role up by the end of the year,” he said.</p> <p>“Our goal is to locate at least 200 copies – or 20% of the original population – and hear some great stories along the way. We’re off to a good start. I’m confident that we will make it and in the process ignite some interesting conversations around books and poetry.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fgnv","wordcount":"570","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/63fc4f645e49a3aca3f97a6ffe546d618ab5e84d/550_889_4048_2428/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-08T15:00:28Z","standfirst":"<p>Theodore Roethke Home museum in Michigan asks owners of hand-numbered copies of Open House to get in touch, for ‘census’ to mark 75th anniversary of poetry collection</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/565c7619e4b037ebb2afff26\">Guardian Witness: Do you own any first, signed or otherwise special book editions?

midday to 4pm.

Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
