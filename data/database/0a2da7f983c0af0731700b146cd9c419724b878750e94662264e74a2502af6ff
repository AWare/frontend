Between 500 and 1,000 younger men are said to have been involved in the attacks; around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne\">100 complaints have been made, two-thirds of which are about sexual assault</a>. The incidents prompted calls for German chancellor Angela Merkel to rethink her open-door policy to refugees.</p> <p>Okwonga, who has won prizes for his poetry, <a href=\"http://www.okwonga.com/how-to-deal-with-the-sexual-assaults-in-cologne/\">writes on his blog</a> that “many of these attackers were already known to the police, and were not drawn from the recently-arrived refugees … [but] that’s not going to stop this conversation being dominated by the issue of race, so we may as well go there”.</p> <p>In an essay, Okwonga goes on to argue that it is more important to focus on a woman’s right not to be assaulted than on race. “As far as being a black man of African descent goes, the racists in Germany and elsewhere hate us anyway,” he writes. The Harry Potter author deemed it “the best comment I’ve read on the Cologne attacks, written by a black man of African descent living in Germany”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cultural expectations of black men in some parts of Germany are already dangerously low</p> <footer> <cite>Musa Okwonga</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Okwonga laid out how Germany is “not particularly diverse” racially, that the majority of the black and Arab people who live there are working class, and there is “a tendency, more widespread that many people might like to acknowledge, to regard black men as inherently untrustworthy or criminal”.</p> <p>“In Berlin, where I live, the overwhelming majority of black men you see every day are poor, homeless, or selling drugs by Görlitzer Bahnhof or Warschauer Strasse, two of the city’s busier train stations. And when I say the overwhelming majority, I would say something like 80%, if not more,” he writes.</p> <p>While he loves living in Berlin, Okwonga says some Berliners will leave a space next to him, even on crowded trains, “somehow fearing the prospect of sitting next to a male of African appearance”, and adds: “The cultural expectations of black men in some parts of Germany are already dangerously low.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/statuses/684831644734369794\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Okwonga\">@Okwonga</a> Usual character limit problem meant I couldn&#39;t get your name into retweet!

Why don’t we just start with the premise that it is a woman’s fundamental right, wherever she is in the world, to walk the streets and not be groped. And why don’t we see this as a perfect moment for men, regardless of our ethnic backgrounds, to get genuinely angry about the treatment of women in public spaces: to reject with fury the suggestion that we are somehow conditioned by society forever to treat women as objects, condemned by our uncontrollable sexual desires to lunge at them as they walk past.”</p> <p>Okwonga continues: “Let’s do our best to challenge the rampant misogyny, which has gone on worldwide for far too long, and reject whatever lessons of sexist repression we may have been taught. Because women are tired of telling us about this, and exhausted of fighting a battle that for too long has gone overlooked.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/dec/19/musa-okwonga-ode-this-is-football-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3yamv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2015550\"            data-video-name=\"Musa Okwonga's ode to 150 years of the FA: This is Football – video\"            data-video-provider=\"FA\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/18/1387379066094/Musa-Okwongas-ode-to-150--005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-425304627\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_8467150.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball/131218ThisIsFootball.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/18/131218ThisIsFootball_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Video: Musa Okwonga’s poem This is Football, which was commissioned by the Football Association to commemorate its 150th anniversary.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Okwonga, who has written two books about football, won the WH Smith young writers’ competition in 1996 and has been commissioned to write poems for the BBC World Service and the Football Association.

I thought I would pick up a car somewhere and drive to exciting new places: Greece, Slovenia, Poland, Spain. Inevitably, once I arrived in London, reality set in. There was a shared flat and a job in theatre to be found. Once I had secured both of those, it was a lot harder to pick up and leave. I’ve taken weekends and odd weeks here and there, to see some of the places on my list, but it’s a long way from the dream of a few months with just a backpack for company. </p> <p> Thank goodness.</p> <p> I have been living out of a suitcase for the past nine weeks. What I have realised in this time is that I’m not really the backpacking type. I could live the rest of my life in one pair of shoes and a couple of different dresses, but am hopelessly attached to my mixer. I like my knives and my big navy woollen blanket and my frankly ridiculous collection of cookbooks. The generosity of my extraordinary friends (and <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/12/21/crystallised-ginger-the-adventure-of-the-christmas-pudding\">aforementioned adopted family</a>) means that I have been thrilled to be staying on sofas and in spare rooms, with clean towels and cups of tea, instead of in hostels, sharing a room with 16 strangers and showering in my flip-flops. But I have been moving around quite a bit, packing and unpacking my bag with alarming regularity. And it’s not something I fancy doing again, even though I realise how incredibly lucky I’d be to be able to do it around Europe. The truth is, I like being at home.</p> <p> The travelling time in these past months (flights, London buses, the <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/8/13/marzipan-the-miniaturist\">longest train journey</a> I’ve ever taken) have afforded me luxurious hours for reading. When I was starting to feel a little rootless and was longing for my old flat back, I read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/23/the-book-of-strange-new-things-michel-faber-review\">The Book of Strange New Things</a><em>. </em>It certainly put my wistful thoughts into perspective. The central character Peter is (quite literally) light years from home and his wife Bea, working with strange aliens and even stranger human colleagues. On a long and unfamiliar drive, Grainger provides him with what must surely be the most comforting food on Earth: bread, still warm from the oven. Faber details the ingredients – some brought from Earth, some found on Oasis. The bicarbonate and egg make it sound like a variation on soda bread. </p> <p> Best served with a generous scrape of butter, this is simple comfort food (and comfort cooking) at its best. For Peter, so far away from home, and for me, feeling a little bit lost without mine, it was just what was needed.</p> <h2><strong>Raisin bread: the recipe</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes 1 loaf – 10 or so slices</strong></p> <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br /> 450g plain flour<br /> 40g butter<br /> 1tsp salt<br /> 5g sugar<br /> 1tsp bicarbonate of soda<br /> 275ml buttermilk<br /> 1 egg<br /> 100g raisins</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f250d2394e4aa1c0c636ea064fa3a628124ecd0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4f250d2394e4aa1c0c636ea064fa3a628124ecd0/0_161_1064_739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"flour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Faber details the ingredients – some brought from Earth, some found on [a planet called] Oasis.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <strong>Equipment</strong> <br /> Mixing bowl<br /> Sieve<br /> Measuring jug<br /> Baking tray<br /> Greaseproof paper<br /> Serrated knife</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1</strong> First, preheat the oven to 210C. Once the oven is hot, you can start with the rest of the recipe. The bread needs to go straight in the oven once it is shaped, so do have it hot first.<br /></p> <p><strong> 2 </strong>Pour the flour into the bowl and rub the butter through it until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Sieve the sugar, salt, bicarbonate of soda into the flour and toss through with your hands.</p> <p><strong> 3 </strong>Combine the egg and buttermilk in a jug. Pour the flour mixture out onto the bench. Make a well in the centre, then pour the buttermilk in. Using a fork, bring the flour into the liquid and mix until combines. Work quite quickly here, as you want the bread to be in the oven while the bicarbonate is reacting with the buttermilk. Knead the dough very briefly.</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Shape the dough into a ball, and place on a lined baking tray. Make a deep cross in the top, cutting down at least half the height of the loaf. Bake for thirty minutes, until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the base. Leave it for at least ten minutes (but not much longer) before slicing into it. It won’t keep as well as most breads, so do toast it if you’re eating it after the first day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a54f81c6411eddd7910f975159a275a3a923e3fd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a54f81c6411eddd7910f975159a275a3a923e3fd/0_154_1047_833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"raisin bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Best served with a generous scrape of butter, this is simple comfort food (and comfort cooking) at its best.

Whether it’s a no-nonsense Miss that can silence a room with a word, or a bullying Sir that makes you do PE in your socks; every school has one of those teachers that you don’t want to cross. Thankfully, most teachers are brilliant, and don’t lock anybody in cupboards, turn invisible to spy on students, or try to take over the world. But, in this list, we’ll take a look at some of the ones who do...<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/jun/15/10-best-roald-dahl-characters\">The 10 best Roald Dahl characters – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <strong>1. Miss Trunchbull in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/matilda-14.html\">Matilda</a> by Roald Dahl</strong></p> <p>Miss Trunchbull is often the first name to spring to mind when you think of terrifying teachers. In both the book and film of Roald Dahl’s classic, she is an enormous presence in more ways than one. She despises children and strikes fear into the hearts of many readers. Her extreme punishments are famous, including spinning a girl around by her pigtails and forcing a boy who steals a slice of cake to eat an <em>entire</em> cake by himself in front of the school. She runs her school – Crunchem Hall – with an iron fist, and you’d most likely want to avoid being a pupil there at all costs.</p> <p><strong>2. Professor Snape in the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-25.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</strong></p> <p>Although later revelations in the series changed how some people view Snape, there’s no doubt that he deserves a place on this list. The Hogwarts potions master is a bully, regularly snapping at students and carrying a vendetta against Harry and his friends: <em>“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”</em> But the raven-haired professor also has links to the dark arts and the notorious Death Eaters, and he isn’t afraid to use an unforgiveable curse...</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/13/jill-murphy-the-worst-witch-sibeal-pounder\">My inspiration: Sibéal Pounder on Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3. Miss Hardbroom in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/worst-witch-4.html\">The Worst Witch series</a> by Jill Murphy</strong></p> <p>Much like Snape is to Dumbledore, potions teacher Miss Hardbroom is the super strict counterpart to the kindly headmistress Miss Cackle. With her black dress, sharp face and hair in an impossibly tight bun, Miss Hardbroom would likely get on well with Miss Fox in my books, and would probably share her views on discipline. She is frequently displeased with main character Mildred Hubble, and indeed it is her who brands Mildred with the title of <em>“the worst witch in the school”</em>. Miss Hardbroom is a very powerful witch, and even possesses the ability to become invisible and spy on pupils – every mischievous student’s worst nightmare. She does have a softer side, though, which occasionally shines through when Mildred manages to save the day.</p> <p><strong>4. The Demon Headmaster in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/demon-headmaster-2.html\">The Demon Headmaster series</a> by Gillian Cross</strong></p> <p>The Demon Headmaster was terrifying to me as a kid. Whether it was the TV show or Cross’s books, you couldn’t escape those glowing green eyes, the dark glasses, the deadly stare. With his hypnotic powers, he controls an army of prefects – only shy new pupil Dinah Glass and secret club SPLAT are immune. He has ambitions beyond just controlling his school, too, using his abilities to try and take over the world in later books. Little is known about the man himself, not even his name, which makes him all the more mysterious and creepy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/jk-rowling-reveals-the-secrets-of-dolores-umbridge\">JK Rowling reveals the secrets of Dolores Umbridge</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>5. Professor Umbridge in the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-25.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</strong></p> <p>Few characters are more despised by readers than Dolores Umbridge. The pink-clad and kitten-mad Defence Against The Dark Arts professor starts off as merely sickly smug and annoying, before quickly taking a darker turn. She refuses to believe that the evil Lord Voldemort has returned, instead branding Harry Potter as attention seeking. She forces him to write lines of <em>“I must not tell lies”</em> – but they’re no ordinary lines, as he must use a Blood Quill which carves the words into his hand.</p> <p>In her time at Hogwarts, Umbridge picks on both students and staff, has beloved teachers fired, and refuses to properly teach her subject. She proves to be highly prejudiced against “muggle borns” (wizards born to non-magical parents), which leads her to committing atrocities later in the series. Umbridge is a good lesson in not judging by appearances, and is truly a terrifying teacher in more ways than one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/27/top-10-villains-in-ya-fiction\">Top 10 villains in YA fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>6. Miss Vole in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308491/\">Moondial</a> by Helen Cresswell</strong></p> <p>Miss Vole is another character who frightened me when I was younger. In the book<em>, </em>young Minty discovers that the sundial in the gardens of the nearby Belton House is in fact a moondial, a magical object that can transport you forwards and backwards in time. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, a girl named Sarah is tormented by Miss Vole – a wicked governess (a live-in teacher) who convinces her that her birthmark is a sign of evil. She tells her that if she ever looks in the mirror, the mirror will crack and the devil will come out to get her. Although we only see glimpses of Miss Vole, she was always such a vivid character that she stuck in my imagination. Unlike poor Sarah, Minty can escape by returning to the present. That is until the mysterious Miss Raven arrives at Minty’s aunt’s home, and her face is very familiar…</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/sep/14/little-princess-hodgson-burnett-review\">A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. Miss Minchin in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-princess-10.html\">A Little Princess</a> by Frances Hodgson Burnett</strong></p> <p>Continuing the tradition of scary adults abusing their power over children is Frances Hodgson Burnett’s Miss Minchin. When seven-year-old Sara Crewe joins her boarding school, she hides her jealousy over the girl’s wealth and popularity. But when Sara’s father tragically dies and can no longer pay the bills, the horrible headmistress has her imprisoned in the attic with little but a few dresses and a doll, and forces her to work as a scullery maid. </p> <p>Throughout all the abuse Sara gets from the headmistress, she remains polite and dignified – just like a real princess. <em>“If I am a princess in rags and tatters,”</em> she says, <em>“I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.”</em></p> <p><strong>8. Miss Slighcarp and Mrs Brisket in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/wolves-of-willoughby-chase.html\">The Wolves of Willoughby Chase</a> by Joan Aiken</strong></p> <p>For this entry, we have a dastardly duo of terrifying teachers. In a time that never really happened, England has been overrun by wolves in a cold winter. A young girl named Sylvia is sent to live with her cousin Bonnie in the grand Willoughby Estate, only to find that her kindly parents are off on a trip and are leaving the intimidating Miss Slighcarp in charge of the girls. The sharp woman is immediately bad-tempered, striking Bonnie and locking her in a cupboard. She steals Bonnie’s mother’s dresses, fires all of the other household staff and threatens to starve the children. Eventually, when the full extent of her devious plans are revealed, the girls are shipped off to a horrific boarding school. There they meet horrible headmistress Mrs Brisket, who is just as bad (if not worse): she forces her pupils to work as slaves in terrible conditions while she lives in luxury. Truly a nasty double act you wouldn’t want to meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/oct/29/top-10-haunted-houses-in-fiction\">Top 10 haunted houses in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. Miss Lupescu in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/graveyard-book-2.html\">The Graveyard Book</a> by Neil Gaiman</strong></p> <p>Miss Lupescu is a terrifying teacher in a few strange and unexpected ways. When she’s first set the task of looking after Bod, a child raised in the graveyard, she is strict and seems lacking in empathy. She feeds him strange, horrible foods that make him sick: <em>“dumplings swimming in lard; thick reddish purple soup with a lump of sour cream in it; cold boiled potatoes; cold garlic-heavy sausages.”</em> She demands that he pays attention to her boring lessons. Only later on in the book when Bod falls into deep trouble with a group of ghouls do we find that these lessons were very important indeed. Miss Lupescu is much more than she seems, and she becomes an important guardian, protector and friend for Bod.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/10/terry-pratchett-interview-dragons-at-crumbling-castle\">Terry Pratchett: I started writing my new book when I was 17-years-old</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. Susan Sto Helit in the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/first-discworld-novels.html\">Discworld series</a> by Terry Pratchett</strong></p> <p>When your teacher is the granddaughter of Death himself, you know not to cross her. Although not usually terrifying to her students (unless they misbehave), Susan certainly strikes fear into the heart of any monsters that might seek to harm them. In her first job as a governess, she handily dispatches anything that might be lurking under the bed with the help of a poker. She’s respected, feared, and loved, but certainly is no Mary Poppins. In fact she swears that if she ever finds herself dancing on rooftops with chimney sweeps, she’ll beat herself to death with her own umbrella.</p> <p>When Susan graduates to school teaching, she uses her powers to give the children some fascinating lessons: whether it’s viewing ancient battles first-hand, or meeting Death and his horse. Her teaching methods are somewhat unusual, with parents and other teachers claiming that the tasks she sets are far too hard for children – to which Susan responds that she hasn’t told the children this, and so far they haven’t noticed. She is greatly fond of children, as long as they aren’t raw…</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8aab72a1a568c13212a61f2bd22df12602b1e1d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a8aab72a1a568c13212a61f2bd22df12602b1e1d/0_0_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Cleverly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Cleverly.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophie Cleverly is the author of the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/lost-twin.html\">Scarlet and Ivy series</a> of mystery adventures set in a boarding school.

include BAME authors on its giveaway list, has rebranded as #ReadDiverse2016 to ‘celebrate diversity in all its forms’ for the whole year","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>#DiverseDecember, last month’s celebration of writers of colour, was “hugely popular” according to the book bloggers who created it, and who are planning to continue the initiative through 2016.</p> <p>Bloggers Naomi Frisby and Dan Lipscombe launched the #DiverseDecember campaign on Twitter, in response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/world-book-night-criticised-all-white-2016-giveaway-list\">absence of titles by writers of colour on the books selected for this year’s World Book Night</a>. “The idea was to only read books by BAME writers throughout December, tweeting titles and mini-reviews to highlight books and share recommendations by a range of voices,” said Frisby, who blogs at <a href=\"https://thewritesofwoman.wordpress.com/\">the Writes of Women</a>. “It’s been hugely popular. More people than we ever envisaged have taken part.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/11/how-do-we-stop-uk-publishing-being-so-posh-white-male\">How do we stop UK publishing being so posh and white?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“When I coined the term, I did so in order to celebrate different voices in literature – I didn’t think it would take off the way it has,” added Lipscombe, who blogs at <a href=\"https://utterbiblio.wordpress.com/\">UtterBiblio</a>. “I’ve seen many more people talking about diversity over the last few weeks, the publishing industry needs to take note.”</p> <p>Publishers as well as readers and authors got involved in the project, said Frisby, with both mainstream and independent presses posting recommended reads and running giveaways. “Statistics suggest we reached more than 13,500 people via the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReadDiverse2016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Diverse December Twitter account</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/diversedecember?src=hash\">Diverse December hashtag</a> trended for five hours on 1 December and 17 hours on the 2nd,” she said.</p> <p>Frisby believes the campaign has helped to introduce readers to writers and books they might not otherwise have heard of. “It’s been interesting to see some readers talk about how they’ve never interrogated their reading choices before, and are now reading a narrow range of voices because of this. It was great to see some publishers taking part,” she says, adding that she hopes that as people read and discuss work by writers of colour, publishing catalogues and the industry itself will become more diverse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/30/authors-slam-lack-diversity-in-uk-publishing-nikesh-shukla-jon-mcgregor\">'Where are the brown people?': authors slam lack of diversity in UK publishing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the project’s success, Lipscombe and Frisby have expanded the campaign to a whole year, rebranding it as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReadDiverse2016\">#ReadDiverse2016</a>. “We’re still celebrating and recommending writers of colour, but also writers who identify as part of the LGBT communities and those who are differently abled,” said Frisby. “We’re celebrating diversity in all its forms, hoping to reach a point where someone’s race, sexual preference or body no longer marks them as ‘other’ and no longer forms a barrier to people publishing the stories they want to tell.”</p> <p>The author Nikesh Shukla, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/30/authors-slam-lack-diversity-in-uk-publishing-nikesh-shukla-jon-mcgregor\">first highlighted World Book Night’s lack of diversity</a>, said: “Various microaggressions that people have experienced in isolation are now being talked about on social media. And the conversation is widening to look at equally important things like class,” said Shukla, who is editing an anthology on race and immigration by British black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) writers.</p> <p>However, after scanning lists of titles to be published in 2016, Shukla says there was still a “lack of books by people of colour”. He has put together <a href=\"http://mediadiversified.org/2015/12/20/12-writers-of-colour-im-excited-about-reading-in-2016/\">a selection for Media Diversified</a>, after asking publishers for suggestions. “About 40 to 50 books were recommended to me,” he says. “Hardly any of them were by British writers of colour, and of those that were, hardly any were debuts. Which made me slightly unnerved about the lack of nurturing of homegrown talent.” </p> <p>Shukla has been contacted by almost 100 BAME writers since he offered to help ones those looking for representation. “Out of the 100 or so enquiries I’ve had, two now have representation, and half have been sent to different agents. The rest, I’ve sent out advice on how to get the book ready for submission, or the manuscripts are still being worked on,” he said.</p> <h2>Recommended reads from Naomi Frisby and Dan Lipscombe,

Would you like me to sign it for you? No trouble; it would be an honour. Oh, hold on, I can’t – it’s an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ebooks\" title=\"\">ebook</a>.” This is one of the disadvantages of writing ebooks, rather than the good old-fashioned tomes that gather dust. In fact, ebooks are so shiny that they don’t actually exist in the physical world.</p> <p>You worry a little, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/-/e/B000APQC2K/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8&amp;text=David+Boyle&amp;search-alias=digital-text&amp;field-author=David+Boyle&amp;sort=relevancerank\" title=\"\">as an ebook author</a>, that people might be sceptical that you have ever written anything. Or indeed whether all that writing exists in any real sense, since you can’t see it on your shelf. I mean, where is it? You can’t lend it, copy it or give it as a present. Yet bizarrely, online pirates seem capable of giving it away for free within days of it going on sale.</p> <p>There are certainly advantages to writing the new generation of ebooks that are designed as such, rather than as reluctantly issued e-versions of printed books. They are often a convenient length – maybe a fifth or quarter as long as a traditional book, just long enough to read on a transatlantic flight or a train to Scotland. And they are priced low enough to sell widely. It is a marginal decision to buy a short book at £1.99 or £2.99. You might as well buy it as not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/27/new-literature-on-way\">Print survives as a new literature is born | Robert McCrum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have, in that respect, breathed an innovative energy into the book market, with low-cost ebooks at one end and real books, published as objects of beauty, at the other. It’s created another squeezed middle: what is disappearing are the cheap, ubiquitous throwaway paperbacks that fell apart after one reading.</p> <p>As an ebook writer, I’m only too aware of the problem flagged up by the Society of Authors, that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/12083511/Authors-could-become-an-endangered-species-thanks-to-e-book-deals.html\" title=\"\">the income of writers is still falling</a>. I certainly agree that authors should get at least half the royalties on ebooks; the big publishers often fob them off with 25% or less. Well, I would say that.</p> <p>Yet this is not primarily a difficulty with ebooks. It is a symptom of two more fundamental, linked problems. The competition watchdogs have allowed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\" title=\"\">Amazon</a> and the big supermarkets to strangle what had been a working business model. As a result, the remaining, desperately consolidated, mainstream publishers are trapped in a business model that works for nobody – except perhaps for the 5%, the mega-earning authors, who take 43% of all the money.</p> <p>The Society is absolutely right that the nation lives by its creativity, and we are worse off financially and, dare I say, spiritually, if authors have to spend most of their time working in financial services to eke out an evening writing a book.</p> <p>Something has to happen. I can’t imagine that we will return any time soon to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jun/17/net-book-agreement-publishing\" title=\"\">net book agreement</a>, when guaranteed prices kept the midlist authors afloat. Nor are the regulators going to do what they ought to, and break up the budding online monopolies such as Amazon. As a result, the pressures on the old publishers are going to remain intense – though not so intense that they can’t offer better terms to their authors on ebook sales.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regulators have to keep an eye on the bookselling monopolies, which could snuff us innovators out in the blink of an eye</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what can authors do? They can be a bit bolshie when they are asked to speak for no fee. They can refuse to buy any book that costs less than a cup of coffee (except when it’s on special offer, perhaps). And they can innovate their hearts out.</p> <p>There is already huge innovation in the book market, but very little in how the poor authors are paid. But strangely enough, it is the specialist ebook publishers who are developing a different model that pays authors 40 or 50% (of not much, it is true).</p> <p>That is why I’m going to carry on writing ebooks. The length suits me, and I believe it suits my readers. And – although Amazon’s grip on the market prevents us from starting print publishing imprints (60% of a physical book’s price goes to them) – it doesn’t stop us starting our own e-publishing imprints.</p> <p>In fact, that’s exactly what I have decided to do – I’ve published only <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scandal-How-homosexuality-became-crime-ebook/dp/B019EN86XQ/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452120949&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=boyle+scandal\" title=\"\">one book</a> so far, but there is a heady whiff of independence about the idea. And I can pay my authors an encouragingly fair percentage too (70%).</p> <p>But it does rely on two things. First, regulators have to keep an eye on the bookselling monopolies, which could snuff us innovators out in the blink of an eye. Second, the book-buying public has to consciously innovate too – where and how it buys, and maybe even what it buys too. But don’t let’s blame ebooks.

seriously","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.merritttierce.com/\" title=\"\">Merritt Tierce</a>’s debut novel is a stylishly brutal account of the life of a waitress working in a series of Texas restaurants. The protagonist, Marie, suffers from a litany of misfortunes, whose sheer number may at first seem wearying: self-harm, compulsive promiscuity, drug abuse, squalid poverty, teen pregnancy. Furthermore, they are all introduced in the first 30 pages in a dizzying collage of vignettes. The prose is laconic, vernacular; at first, the book seems like a well-executed but predictable entry in the genre of trauma lit.</p> <p>As it develops, however, it moves in a far more interesting direction. The story of Marie’s lost daughter, which initially seems to be the driving force of the book, is shunted to the periphery. The drugs don’t develop into an addiction/recovery narrative; the promiscuity does not lead Marie either to a violent end or an epiphany. In fact, none of these apparent plotlines turns out to be a plotline. They are there for atmosphere: the book is about Marie’s job.</p> <p>For Marie, that job is an addictive chaos. The frenzy of a busy shift in an understaffed restaurant segues into the frenzy of drug-fuelled sex with two co‑workers in a speeding car. In a characteristic sequence, the manager pisses on the floor of the restaurant, then throws down his shot glass, shattering it, and calls casually for someone to clean it up; an act that is seamlessly absorbed into the restaurant’s rhythm. After all, as Marie tells us, every day the workers “take The Restaurant from pristine and silent down to a staggering state of chaotic, deafening and excessive disarray, and then put it all back together like no one was ever there”.</p> <p>Marie’s promiscuity comes to feel like a natural part of this cycle. Sex scenes and restaurant scenes bleed into each other; they have the same dissociated feeling and adrenaline rush. Even in the most extreme situations, the tone is matter-of-fact: “There was the night with Casey and Florida John. They got me high and then played <em>Call of Duty</em> while taking turns with me. I stayed in the bedroom on the bed. I would do a line and then a bong hit and one of them would fuck me.” It is impossible to read some of these scenes without feeling terrified for Marie. We keep expecting insults and violence; the moment when casual sex becomes rape. But these men aren’t abusers, they are Marie’s comrades in abuse, and, with minor exceptions, they treat her with the casual respect due to a comrade. When her male co-workers refer to Marie’s willingness to have sex with anyone, they don’t say, “She’s a slut”, but, “She’s for real”.</p> <p>Throughout, the story is elevated by Tierce’s fierce and elegant writing. The pace is that of a cocaine binge, and the voice moves from big-hearted to heartless to maudlin with the frank dispatch of a waitress dealing with a demanding dinner crowd. It is also quietly funny, as in a scene where Marie and her husband have sex on the floor, surrounded by their little girl’s toys: “When he came he kicked the door to her little plastic barn and it made the cow stick its head out with a loud electronic moo. We laughed.” The intimacy here almost makes us forget that they are both still teenagers, and that he has stopped eating after learning about her serial infidelities.</p> <p>There are points at which the plot wanders – particularly in an interlude about a restaurant pianist, when the narrative shifts, jarringly and unnecessarily, into third person. Sometimes Marie’s voice feels a little glib; cool for cool’s sake. But these brief lapses scarcely matter: the scenes are too powerful, too real. We are unequivocally along for the ride.</p> <p>It is also heartening to read an American novel that takes working-class life seriously. Here, the world of waiting tables is an arena large enough for tragedy and glory, and Tierce is not documenting the lives of its people from the viewpoint of an anthropologist, but singing them as their Homer. A waiter who coaxes exorbitant tips from his tables isn’t a sleaze, but an Odysseus; the disturbed veteran who inducts Marie into her first restaurant job is both a squalid, real person and a Charon. Nor does the heroic tone feel like hyperbole. It is the size of life seen from the inside – because we are never in any doubt that these are Tierce’s people. She is not just telling stories about them, she is bearing witness on their behalf, and she does so with a wholly writerly – that is, ruthless – love.</p> <p>• Sandra Newman’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/country-of-ice-cream-star-272380.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Country of Ice Cream Star</em></a> is published by Vintage.

In fact, it went far beyond my expectations and I was gripped from the very beginning. </p> <p>I told myself I’d read the first page of each of the four books on the shortlist, and this happened to be the book on the top of the pile… and you guessed it. I read the first page, then the second, then before I knew it, I was well into the book! It is a truly brilliantly written novel and every single word has importance. It is not full of flowery description but is straight to the point, and in an odd way, this seemed to be more valuable than heavy description as it left a lot to the imagination of the reader, which I really liked. </p> <p>Jessica’s Ghost begins by focusing on a boy named Francis. He’s not into games or fighting, but he likes sewing clothes, which doesn’t fit the stereotype. He’s constantly teased at school about his odd hobby, and things are getting pretty tough when he meets Jessica. Jessica – as you might have expected – is a ghost. And Francis seems to be the only one who can hear and see her. There is something strange which is connecting them both, and neither of them understands what it might be. But as more and more people say they can hear and see Jessica, their link is revealed. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fcfd3e022f4002a8bfff7cb52ed8b63c18073cdb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fcfd3e022f4002a8bfff7cb52ed8b63c18073cdb/0_0_361_500/361.jpg\" alt=\"fdfd\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a really fascinating story which is completely unique and original. It was nice to read something fresh: Jessica can do things the typical ghost can do, like go through walls and float in the air, but she can do other things like think of an outfit and suddenly she’s wearing it. This neat little trick comes in handy for Francis, who uses her to model his designs and ideas. Jessica as a character is really interesting. She’s clever and sharp and perceptive, as well as dreamy and beautiful. It’s horrible that she died so young but to the reader it almost seems as if she hasn’t died at all as she’s so much like an ordinary girl. </p> <p>I really did become attached to the characters in the novel, Francis especially. He started off as a lonely, slightly odd boy but by the end he was surrounded by friends who accepted him for who he was and didn’t mind that he wasn’t quite ordinary. The message conveyed by this book is really powerful, and it deals with a rather delicate subject which is all too real in this day and age. I finished this book feeling inspired and uplifted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I really enjoyed reading this novel.

Remains of the Day too many times. Some have already had a copy thrust upon them as a gift. Over the years since I read it, I’ve turned into a Remains of the Day evangelist. It’s not my fault. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro\">Kazuo Ishiguro</a>’s subtle masterpiece about the private agonies of an ageing butler is hardly unknown – it won the 1989 Booker prize, after all – but sometimes you find a piece of writing so well executed, so moving and so perceptive about the lives many of us lead that you can’t help praising it to anyone not quick-witted enough to look busy.</p> <p>A lack of restraint is perhaps the best response to Ishiguro’s novel, which is the tale of a man so burdened by propriety that he lets the love of his life slip through his fingers. Mr Stevens is chief of staff at an English stately home; as the novel opens, in the summer of 1956, he is set to undertake a motoring trip to visit Miss Kenton, a housekeeper who left 20 years earlier to get married. The butler says he wants to ask her if she’d consider returning to work: “Miss Kenton, with her great affection for this house, with her exemplary professionalism, was just the factor needed to enable me to complete a fully satisfactory staff plan for Darlington Hall.” But Stevens isn’t fooling anyone, especially when he lets slip that a letter (“her first in seven years, discounting Christmas cards”) contains hints her marriage is falling apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0010711a47d3e14f7eace89ff87a0917ae09f1e8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0010711a47d3e14f7eace89ff87a0917ae09f1e8/0_0_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kazuo Ishiguro in the Cotswolds in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kazuo Ishiguro, author of the Booker-winning novel The Remains of the Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unreliable narrators – those mysterious figures the reader must try to work out – are ten a penny in fiction. Ishiguro, instead, likes to give us unwitting narrators: speakers who remain trapped in self-preserving fictions, mysteries even to themselves. Bit by bit, you learn to look for the real emotions running beneath the buffed surface of the prose. Stevens reminisces grandly about his former employer, Lord Darlington, an aristocrat who aligned himself with the Nazis and eventually died in disgrace. He sifts through memories of his father – a butler himself, who was aloof to the point of abuse – and holds forth about “dignity”, a concocted ideal that has to do “with a butler’s ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits”.</p> <p>Each journal entry becomes a mannered exercise in avoidance and projection. When Stevens reaches a sensitive subject – such as whether Miss Kenton was driven away by his refusal to admit his feelings for her – he veers off into self-protective prattling, carrying on for pages before he feels able to continue. “All in all,” he writes tellingly, “I cannot see why the option of her returning to Darlington Hall and seeing out her working years there should not offer a very genuine consolation to a life that has come to be so dominated by a sense of waste.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/06/kazuo-ishiguro-the-remains-of-the-day-guardian-book-club\">Kazuo Ishiguro: how I wrote The Remains of the Day in four weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We get a picture of a man trying desperately to keep a lid on his emotions – and what a complete picture it is. The Remains of the Day does that most wonderful thing a work of literature can do: it makes you feel you hold a human life in your hands. When you reach the end, it really does seem as if you’ve lost a friend – a laughably pompous, eggnog-refusing, stick-in-the-mud friend, but a good friend nonetheless. You want to give him a hug, except he’d be outraged.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/rereading-remains-day-salman-rushdie\">The Remains of the Day</a> is a book about a thwarted life. It’s about how class conditioning can turn you into your own worst enemy, making you complicit in your own subservience. It’s probably quite an English book – I can’t imagine readers in more gregarious nations will have much patience with a protagonist who takes four decades to fail to declare his feelings. “Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way,” as Pink Floyd sang. It’s a book for anyone who feels they’ve ever held themselves back when something that truly mattered was within their grasp.</p> <p>Most of all, though, it’s a book about love. Stevens is forced to let go of his illusions about Lord Darlington, his filial pride, his cherished “dignity”, until all that remains is Miss Kenton and what might have been. The story reaches its low-key climax in the quiet surroundings of a Cornish tea-room. I won’t spoil it for you, except to say that, here as elsewhere, what is not said makes all the difference.</p> <p>I once heard that, to make the reader cry, a writer should try to keep the characters dry-eyed. There are some tears in this novel – yet perhaps not enough, because the tale of the steadfast, hopelessly mistaken Stevens gets me every time. If you haven’t read The Remains of the Day, I hope you’ll let me park my professional dignity and beg you to get hold of a copy pronto. And if you’ve read it and loved it, then – whatever you do – don’t keep your feelings to yourself.</p> <ul> <li><a

/></p> <p>Vertigo’s new roster, which includes Gail Simone and Jon Davis-Hunt’s Clean Room, David Baillie and Meghan Hetrick’s Glasgow-set Red Thorn, and Survivor’s Club, from novelist Lauren Beukes and Dale Halverson, is certainly setting the pace … but there’s no shortage other horror comics: from old, rotting hands such as <a href=\"http://newsok.com/article/5441392\">The Walking Dead</a> to the likes of <a href=\"https://imagecomics.com/content/view/the-world-is-run-on-magic-and-in-mythic-that-magic-breaks\">Mythic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/17/8796839/scott-snyder-wytches-image-comics\">Wytches</a> from<a href=\"https://imagecomics.com/content/view/the-world-is-run-on-magic-and-in-mythic-that-magic-breaks\"> Image Comics</a>.</p> <p>Even the wholesome old <a href=\"http://archiecomics.com/\">Archie</a> line has been getting in on the act with a series of dark titles based on their characters, featuring <a href=\"http:// http://archiecomics.com/learn-about-sonic-boom-5-the-launch-of-archie-horror-and-the-june-solicitations-in-the-newest-archie-comics-podcast/\">a Sabrina who’s more black magic than teen witch, and a zombified Jughead</a>.</p> <p>So it’s a pretty crowded market, but there’s always room for one more … especially with the USP that <a href=\"http://waxworkrecords.com/blogs/news/60675077-waxwork-comics\">a new comics line from Waxwork Records is offering</a>.</p> <p>In fact, if you drew up a Venn diagram for collectors and geeks with a circle each for vinyl records, horror movies and comic books, then Waxwork would sit right in the overlap.</p> <p>The New Orleans-based label has made a name for itself with its lavishly packaged vinyl releases of soundtracks from classic and contemporary horror movies, and now they’re pushing more buttons than a mad scientist in a storm-wracked garret with imminent arrival of their very own comic book line.</p> <p>The new <a href=\"http://waxworkrecords.com/blogs/news/60675077-waxwork-comics\">Waxwork Comics</a> range is set to launch next month with the first title, House of Waxwork, which will be an anthology comic modelled on the classic <a href=\"http://www.eccomics.com/\">EC horror comics</a> of yore such as <a href=\"https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=197831\">Tales from the Crypt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-EC-Archives-Vault-Horror/dp/1888472731\">Vault of Horror</a>.</p> <p>And each comic will come with an exclusive original “soundtrack” to the collection of stories on 7-inch coloured vinyl.</p> <p>According to Waxwork founder <a href=\"http://www.blumhouse.com/2015/12/09/first-word-on-waxwork-comics-plus-3-storyread-along-record-recommendations/\">Kevin Bergeron</a>, the anthology will include “all-new tales of the occult, monsters, voodoo, witchcraft, vampires and more.”</p> <p>Waxwork say they have assembled “an outstanding team of the best writers and your favourite artists”. Bergeron<a href=\"http://www.blumhouse.com/2015/12/09/first-word-on-waxwork-comics-plus-3-storyread-along-record-recommendations/\"> said in an interview last month</a>: “We have writers on board that have worked with Dark Horse, Vertigo, DC, Marvel, IDW, BOOM!, Image, everyone.”</p> <p>Aiming for a February release date for House of Waxwork #1, Bergeron added: “We really want Waxwork Comics to be fresh and extremely exciting. We’re really going for it. We are doing that by creating new stories, new art, new music, new characters, working with new talent. It’s a very exciting time. We’re learning a lot.”</p> <p>The EC comics line which Bergeron is modelling his new venture on was published in the 1940s and 1950s and was typified by their gory content and graphic horror. But EC was made the scapegoat of a moral panic on juvenile delinquency, prompted in part by the publication in 1954 of the now infamous book <a href=\"http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html\">Seduction of the Innocent</a>, written by Dr Frederic Wertham and laying the blame for degenerating youth behaviour at the door of the comics industry in general - and EC in particular.</p> <p>The backlash spelled the end for the EC horror line and many others, and ushered in the <a href=\"http://cbldf.org/comics-code-history-the-seal-of-approval/\">Comics Code Authority</a> self-regulation body which aimed to ensure comic books were suitable for children – thus divesting them of their bite. </p> <p>But the EC template is fondly remembered, especially for its device of having an extravagantly grotesque “host” – a crypt-keeper, or witch, who introduced each short story. It was something to which the 1982 movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083767/reference\">Creepshow</a>, directed by George A Romero and written by Stephen King, paid homage and which Waxwork Comics <a href=\"http://waxworkrecords.com/products/creepshow\">will be bringing back </a>in the shape of The Projectionist.</p> <p>The undead Projectionist will haunt the attic of mysterious movie theatre where he will introduce the brand new comic stories in House of Waxwork, which will be “packed with horror, mystery and sci-fi movie mayhem”.</p> <p>It’s a neat bit of symmetry for Waxwork, who have also released the <a href=\"http://waxworkrecords.com/products/creepshow\">Creepshow soundtrack </a>(in “bone swirl vinyl with purple splatter”) among the many horror LPs they have issued since starting up in 2013.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fe47","wordcount":"682","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c5a5d4c30bc8132f4a7c6b68541e7a038efe5cb3/0_40_1000_599/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-10T09:00:06Z","standfirst":"<p>The

dreamers.</p> <p>Published in English by Jacaranda Press and translated by Roland Glasser, Mujila’s novel has been described by the Rumpus as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://therumpus.net/2015/09/tram-83-by-fiston-mwanza-mujila/\">a tale that</a> “delights in absurdities” and extracts “epic poetry from violence, despair and distraction”. </p> <p>Speaking to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://africasacountry.com/2015/11/sex-beer-and-ndombolo-an-interview-with-fiston-mwanza-mujila/\">Africa is a Country</a>, Mujila said: “I wanted <em>Tram</em><em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>to be able to represent a form of exploitation and neocolonialism that happens throughout Africa, not just in the Congo.” </p> <h2><strong>Tram83 – extract</strong></h2> <p>IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE STONE, AND THE STONE PROMPTED OWNERSHIP, AND OWNERSHIP A RUSH, AND THE RUSH BROUGHT AN INFLUX OF MEN OF DIVERSE APPEARANCE WHO BUILT RAILROADS THROUGH THE ROCK, FORGED A LIFE OF PALM WINE, AND DEVISED A SYSTEM, A MIXTURE OF MINING AND TRADING. </p> <p><strong>Northern Station. Friday.</strong> Around seven or nine in the evening. “Patience, friend, you know full well our trains have lost all sense of time.”</p> <p> The Northern Station was going to the dogs. It was essentially an unfinished metal structure, gutted by artillery, train tracks, and locomotives that called to mind the railroad built by Stanley, cassava fields, cut-rate hotels, greasy spoons, bordellos, Pentecostal churches, bakeries, and noise engineered by men of all generations and nationalities combined. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was the only place on earth you could hang yourself, defecate, blaspheme, fall into infatuation, and thieve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was the only place on earth you could hang yourself, defecate, blaspheme, fall into infatuation, and thieve without regard to prying eyes. Indeed, an air of connivance hung ever about the place. Jackals don’t eat jackals. They pounce on the turkeys and partridges, and devour them. According to the fickle but ever-recurring legend, the seeds of all resistance movements, all wars of liberation, sprouted at the station, between two locomotives. And as if that weren’t enough, the same legend claims that the building of the railroad resulted in numerous deaths attributed to tropical diseases, technical blunders, the poor working conditions imposed by the colonial authorities – in short, all the usual clichés.</p> <p>Northern Station. Friday. Around seven or nine. </p> <p>He’d been there nearly three hours, jostling with the passers-by as he waited for the train to arrive. Lucien had been at pains to insist on the sense of time, and on these trains that broke all records of derailment, delay, and overcrowding. Requiem had better things to do than wait for this individual who, with the passing of the years, had lost all importance in his eyes. Ever since he’d turned his back on Marxism, Requiem called everyone who deprived him of his freedom of thought and action armchair communists and slum ideologues. He had merchandise to deliver, his life depended on it. But the train carrying that son of a bitch Lucien was dragging its wheels. </p> <p>Northern Station. Friday. Around...<br /></p> <p> “Would you care for some company, sir?”<br /></p> <p> A girl, dressed for a Friday night in a station whose metal structure is unfinished, had come up to him. A moment to size up the merchandise, a dull thud, a racket that marked the entrance of the beast. </p> <p>“Do you have the time, citizen?” </p> <p>He had adequately assayed the chick and even imagined her lying on her mean little bed, despite the half-light. He pulled her body against his, asked her name, “Call me Requiem,” stroked his fingers across the young creature’s breasts, then another line: “Your thighs have the allure of a vodka bottle...” before disappearing into the murky gloom of the slimy, sticky crowd. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"128b2dfab6cc2afeb8ec511b75ce9d6a5e219d6f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/128b2dfab6cc2afeb8ec511b75ce9d6a5e219d6f/0_70_1050_630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mujila’s tale tells of underage miners and ‘entitled students’ meeting in a riotous nightclub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mujila’s tale tells of underage miners and ‘entitled students’ meeting in a riotous nightclub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Stoddart Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instructions were required. To designate a place they could chat without distraction. The young woman grew pushy. He sighed, bit his lip, and sputtered: “Meet you at Tram 83.” </p> <p>Quite pointless, of course, for he had to take that Lucien home. Requiem shook his head at the very idea. And then there was the merchandise to be delivered to the tourists freshly arrived from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the racket had increased tenfold. The curse of these trains that arrived at this time of night was that they carried all the scum, be they students or mineworkers, who couldn’t get back to town under their own steam. </p> <p>For reasons still unknown, the railroad cut the only university in the region in two. Afternoon classes were disrupted not by the ruckus of the engine but by students gathering their things and leaving the premises, because if you missed those trains, you’d piss your pants, dear intellectual. The few professors who crashed in the suburbs of the City-State slipped their moorings along with their disciples. The survival instinct can’t be learned. It’s innate. Otherwise they’d have introduced instinct classes at university already. The trains passed without stopping, which meant the swiftest students had to grab ahold of the beat up railcars. All’s fair in love and war!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was already thinking of the silicone breasts of the girl waiting for him at Tram 83</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In stark contrast to these impulsive students with their sense of entitlement were the brutish diggers, who departed and returned on the same contraptions. The former reproached the latter for selling short their dignity to the mining operators and brokers of diverse origin. The latter couldn’t care less, displaying, through their rotten luck and bodies stiffened with radioactivity, that you needn’t spend time in the classroom to fuck and then clink glasses of ice-cool beer after. </p> <p>Some students even scratched out a living in the mines to pay their debts. </p> <p>Requiem began to search for the needle in the haystack. The scrawny students, overwhelmed by the goings-on, and angry too, brandished theories like spoils of war. The miner- diggers, or digger-miners, it depends, voiced imprecations we shall refrain from expressing. Every evening, the same opera. They eyed each other up, balked, traded insults, and even came to blows. A legend suggested the figure of one thousand seven hundred dead in the most recent clashes, without counting suffocations and other serious injuries. </p> <p>Weary from the noise, and the alcohol he’d just consumed, Requiem leaned against a pillar, waiting for them to vacate the field. They loitered on the platforms till late into the night: the students with their strike, the miner-diggers with their stinking rusty breath.</p> <p>“I’m a free woman, but I’m still looking for the man of my dreams.” </p> <p>He was already thinking of the silicone breasts of the girl waiting for him at Tram 83. But after so many years apart, how could he abandon Lucien and slip into the folds of the night with that doll? The students and the diggers of mines were still squaring off. As the flurry of insults reached its peak, they headed off on the same road to nowhere. Requiem sensed a presence. He raised his eyebrows: Lucien, in the flesh but skeletal. Requiem stepped forward. He realized that his friend had lost all his weight. That an era was on the wane. That a civilization was champing at the bit. Lucien was dressed all in black, the harmony broken only by a red scarf, the wad of papers under his arm, and an imitation-leather bag, worn thin, slung over his shoulder. Tousled hair. Crumpled face. Mustache intact. Cold gaze. Hoarse voice. They embraced without much enthusiasm. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/congo-cinema-religion-la-belle-at-the-movies\">The death of cinema in Congo: how churches killed off cowboy films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The bastards, don’t tell me they’ve mangled your brains.” </p> <p>“What’s your news?”<br /></p> <p> “What about Jacqueline?”<br /></p> <p> “Long story.” </p> <p>“How did you get out?”<br /></p> <p> “I’ll tell you.”<br /></p> <p> “The bastards, the bastards, they...”<br /></p> <p> “Shall we go?”<br /></p> <p> “Yes,” replied Requiem, coldly, no doubt haunted by the girl dressed for a Friday night in a station whose metal structure is unfinished, where dissident sex-starved rebels, students, and diggers head off on the same road.</p> <p>“I’m a really sensitive girl.”<br /></p> <p>Two fat tears slid down the face of the man who’d arrived by train in this station whose metal structure...

They began with absurd metaphors and oddly phrased lines about annoying siblings and worlds that don’t exist – like all great novels penned by seven-year-olds do. Unlike most great childhood novels, however, they were heavily censored. The words “Bangladeshi” and “Muslim” were crossed out in my mind before they could ever meet paper. My characters were fierce, intelligent heroines, but there was never a mention of brown skin or a headscarf.</p> <p>Books were precious, but they taught me a lesson I’d never had at school: in stories, people of my ethnicity and faith cannot exist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/13/50-best-culturally-diverse-childrens-books\">Diverse voices: the 50 best culturally diverse books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, I’m not here to speak solely about a specific religion or ethnicity, but all ethnic and religious minorities, because I have found that no matter how many foreign-sounding names and dark-skinned people authors put in books, these communities are still absent from their pages. I think sometimes it’s easy to forget that the word we proudly place beside society is “multicultural”, not “multicoloured”. So when I read the briefest mentions of Indian Parvati Patel in Harry Potter (which is a series, I should note, I adore) or Asian Marika (Ringer) from The Fifth Wave series by Rick Yancey, I see characters virtually identical to everybody else, with no differentiated culture attached. </p> <p>This, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing. There are people from ethnic or religious minority backgrounds whose lifestyles are very similar to mainstream culture, and their representation is just as important as anybody else’s. But the people who do have different lifestyles, who eat and dress and speak and think and live differently, need representation too.</p> <p>The current representation of Muslim lifestyles, for example, from what I’ve witnessed, is brief: I’ve almost never read a mention of daily prayers or Quranic lessons which form such a significant part of young Muslims’ daily lives. I was discussing the matter with another blogger recently, and she expressed disappointment that there was also specifically a lack of strong-minded religious Muslim girls in YA novels, ie girls who weren’t either being forced into certain practices or had their piety glossed over. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/22/muslim-teenage-identity-tariq-mehmood\">Teenage and a Muslim? We need more books about your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need authors who write about different cultures and beliefs with all their wonderful differences, so we don’t have children who are ashamed of them. Some children’s books are already breaking the mould: Anna Perera’s YA title <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/guantanamo-boy.html\">Guantanamo Boy</a> is a brilliant example of a work of fiction with Muslim and Pakistani characters, while Irfan Master’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beautiful-lie.html\">A Beautiful Lie</a>, set during the struggle for Indian independence, does the same for Indian characters, Sikh, Hindu and Muslim alike. But these are diverse novels that essentially base themselves on being diverse: either they are making a statement about prejudice, or they are relaying a historical event in another country. </p> <p>I would argue we need children’s novels that are diverse without diversity being its selling point. Imagine an Enid Blyton style series about children in a Jewish boarding school, or a Narnia-esque fantasy about South African siblings. We need books where ethnic and religious minorities appear in all genres and books where differences are quietly embraced, rather than being made a show of or carefully elided. We need books that do not simply represent more minorities to combat stereotypes and educate readers, but also biracial characters and mixed ethnicity marriages and families; this would be a more tangible way to show coexistence and acceptance is possible, as well as a way to represent less conventional family types. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/15/muslim-characters-childrens-teen-fiction\">Na'ima B Robert: Where are all the Muslim characters in children's fiction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We speak so often of the need for change to ensure inclusion.

Feynman aimed to turn the standard physics curriculum on its head, introducing young students to some of the most exciting questions in the field right away, rather than slogging through the usual staid topics en route to the research frontier.</p> <p>By most accounts (including Feynman’s own), the classroom experiment was a flop. Even in the hands of such an acclaimed teacher, the leap was just too far for most incoming students to handle. Yet all was not lost. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/feynman-lectures-on-physics.html\"><em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em></a>, first published in 1964, have become some of the most admired – even, cherished – lectures in modern science. Sales of the English-language edition have topped 1.5m copies, and counting. An abridged version, consisting of the more elementary material, was published under the title <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/six-easy-pieces.html\"><em>Six Easy Pieces</em></a>.</p> <p>A reader might expect Carlo Rovelli’s new book, <em>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</em>, translated by <a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/C/S/au6899733.html\">Simon Carnell</a> and Erica Segre, to offer an update on Feynman’s <em>Six Easy Pieces</em>, with a bonus lesson thrown in for good measure. Stylistically, however, the books are worlds apart. Rather than hark back to Feynman’s model from half a century ago, <em>Seven Brief Lessons</em> evokes an even earlier scientific bestseller and publishing sensation, <a href=\"http://www.achillevandenbranden.net/2008/10/bernard-le-bovier-de-fontanelle/\">Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520071711\"><em>Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds</em></a>, first published in 1686.</p> <p>Feynman sought above all to teach core principles, to convey (with a minimum of mathematics) some notion of the deep structures at the heart of modern physics. Though he remains beloved today for his wild tales of safe‑cracking and bongo-drumming – stories that mostly emerged in later autobiographical vignettes – his lectures from the 1960s were didactic and clear, fuelled by a kind of Sputnik-era earnestness.</p> <p>Fontenelle’s book was shaped by rather different sensibilities. Learned scholars of his day had to entertain courtly patrons, and Fontenelle aimed to charm his readers as much as instruct them. In his preface (as rendered in an 1803 English translation) he warned readers who had “some knowledge of natural philosophy” that his little book was not “capable of giving them any information; it will merely afford them some amusement, by presenting in a lively manner what they have already become acquainted with by dint of study”. For those who had not studied the latest science, Fontenelle noted that he had chosen topics “most calculated to excite curiosity” – ideas that were “in themselves beautiful” and that “give as much pleasure as if formed only to charm the imagination”.</p> <p>Rovelli, too, seeks to charm as well as instruct. “There are absolute masterpieces which move us intensely,” he writes, “Mozart’s <em>Requiem</em>; Homer’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/odyssey-37.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Odyssey</em></a>; the Sistine Chapel; <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/king-lear-23.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>King Lear</em></a>.” (Three-quarters of his list could have appeared in Fontenelle’s book.) “To fully appreciate their brilliance may require a long apprenticeship,” he continues, “but the reward is sheer beauty.” To his list, Rovelli appends the general theory of relativity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Albert Einstein</a>’s elegant description of gravity arising from the warp and weft of space and time.</p> <p>“Within [Einstein’s] equation there is a teeming universe,” he writes, “a phantasmagorical succession of predictions that resemble the delirious ravings of a madman, but which have all turned out to be true.” What ravings? “The theory describes a colourful and amazing world where universes explode, space collapses into bottomless holes, time sags and slows near a planet, and the unbounded extensions of interstellar space ripple and sway like the surface of the sea.”</p> <p>Rovelli proceeds with similar flair to the incessant quantum jitters of matter, the roiling explosion of the big bang, and the soaring symmetries according to which elementary particles seem to be arranged. “A handful of types of elementary particles,” he writes, “which vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and non-existence and swarm into space even when it seems that there is nothing there, combine together to infinity like the letters of a cosmic alphabet to tell the immense history of galaxies, of the innumerable stars, of sunlight, of mountains, woods and fields of grain, of the smiling faces of the young at parties, and of the night sky studded with stars.” Or, as Fontenelle had put it 300 years earlier: “Do you not think … that the charms of a fine night greatly exceed those of the day?”</p> <p>Rovelli’s and Fontenelle’s books share more than just paeans to the night sky. Fontenelle popularised the Copernican notion that Earth was but one planet among many, and hence the universe could be filled with a plurality of worlds much like our own. Rovelli introduces readers to physicists’ more recent, heady attempts to unite gravity with quantum theory – attempts that have led many leading physicists to imagine a plurality of distinct universes, all bubbling within some encompassing “multiverse”, or perhaps a single universe caught in an endless loop, cycling from big bang to big crunch to big bang again.</p> <p>How far we are from Feynman’s world, in which a good fraction of the imagined audience of science students sat beneath fluorescent lights. A devoted reader might walk away from <em>Six Easy Pieces</em> with an appreciation of how physicists deploy a concept like the conservation of energy to order experience. Rovelli instead invites his readers to marvel at the splendours of modern physics, to be enchanted by the beauty and the open-ended nature of the quest – to muse more than to mull.</p> <p>With luck, his charming, lyrical invitation may well achieve Feynman’s original goal: to get students excited about the biggest questions in physics, inspiring them to dig in and push right to the heart of the unknown.</p> <p>• David Kaiser’s latest book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-the-hippies-saved-physics-2.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>How the Hippies Saved Physics</em></a><em> is published by WW Norton</em>.

dingy basement. But new studies have cast doubt on its supremacy – and shown dramatic results for psychoanalysis. Is it time to get back on the couch?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Dr David Pollens is a psychoanalyst who sees his patients in a modest ground-floor office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a neighbourhood probably only rivalled by the Upper West Side for the highest concentration of therapists anywhere on the planet. Pollens, who is in his early 60s, with thinning silver hair, sits in a wooden armchair at the head of a couch; his patients lie on the couch, facing away from him, the better to explore their most embarrassing fears or fantasies. Many of them come several times a week, sometimes for years, in keeping with analytic tradition. He has an impressive track record treating anxiety, depression and other disorders in adults and children, through the medium of uncensored and largely unstructured talk.</p> <p>To visit Pollens, as I did one dark winter’s afternoon late last year, is to plunge immediately into the arcane Freudian language of “resistance” and “neurosis”, “transference” and “counter-transference”. He exudes a sort of warm neutrality; you could easily imagine telling him your most troubling secrets. Like other members of his tribe, Pollens sees himself as an excavator of the catacombs of the unconscious: of the sexual drives that lurk beneath awareness; the hatred we feel for those we claim to love; and the other distasteful truths about ourselves we don’t know, and often don’t wish to know.</p> <p>But there’s a very well-known narrative when it comes to therapy and the relief of suffering – and it leaves Pollens and his fellow psychoanalysts decisively on the wrong side of history. For a start, Freud (this story goes) has been debunked. Young boys don’t lust after their mothers, or fear their fathers will castrate them; adolescent girls don’t envy their brothers’ penises. No brain scan has ever located the ego, super-ego or id. The practice of charging clients steep fees to ponder their childhoods for years – while characterising any objections to this process as “resistance”, demanding further psychoanalysis – looks to many like a scam. “Arguably no other notable figure in history was so fantastically wrong about nearly every important thing he had to say” than Sigmund Freud, the philosopher <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/feb/18/opinion/oe-dufresne18\" title=\"\">Todd Dufresne declared a few years back</a>, summing up the consensus and echoing the Nobel prize-winning scientist <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UkLzLIkRSo8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=the+most+stupendous+intellectual+confidence+trick+of+the+20th+century.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IjOObWrhXL&amp;sig=ak3h7dpbp8nuC5WfSGFe9pn3XJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20most%20stupendous%20intellectual%20confidence%20trick%20of%20the%2020th%20century.&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Peter Medawar, who in 1975 called psychoanalysis</a> “the most stupendous intellectual confidence trick of the 20th century”. It was, Medawar went on, “a terminal product as well – something akin to a dinosaur or a zeppelin in the history of ideas, a vast structure of radically unsound design and with no posterity.”</p> <p>A jumble of therapies emerged in Freud’s wake, as therapists struggled to put their endeavours on a sounder empirical footing. But from all these approaches – including humanistic therapy, interpersonal therapy, transpersonal therapy, transactional analysis and so on – it’s generally agreed that one emerged triumphant. Cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, is a down-to-earth technique focused not on the past but the present; not on mysterious inner drives, but on adjusting the unhelpful thought patterns that cause negative emotions. In contrast to the meandering conversations of psychoanalysis, a typical CBT exercise might involve filling out a flowchart to identify the self-critical “automatic thoughts” that occur whenever you face a setback, like being criticised at work, or rejected after a date.</p> <p>CBT has always had its critics, primarily on the left, because its cheapness – and its focus on getting people quickly back to productive work – makes it suspiciously attractive to cost-cutting politicians. But even those opposed to it on ideological grounds have rarely questioned that CBT does the job. Since it first emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, so many studies have stacked up in its favour that, these days, the clinical jargon “empirically supported therapies” is usually just a synonym for CBT: it’s the one that’s based on facts. Seek a therapy referral on the NHS today, and you’re much more likely to end up, not in anything resembling psychoanalysis, but in a short series of highly structured meetings with a CBT practitioner, or perhaps learning methods to interrupt your “catastrophising” thinking via a PowerPoint presentation, or online.</p> <p>Yet rumblings of dissent from the vanquished psychoanalytic old guard have never quite gone away. At their core is a fundamental disagreement about human nature – about why we suffer, and how, if ever, we can hope to find peace of mind. CBT embodies a very specific view of painful emotions: that they’re primarily something to be eliminated, or failing that, made tolerable. A condition such as depression, then, is a bit like a cancerous tumour: sure, it might be useful to figure out where it came from – but it’s far more important to get rid of it. CBT doesn’t exactly claim that happiness is easy, but it does imply that it’s relatively simple: your distress is caused by your irrational beliefs, and it’s within your power to seize hold of those beliefs and change them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>CBT embodies a specific view of painful emotions: that they’re primarily something to be eliminated, or made tolerable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Psychoanalysts contend that things are much more complicated. For one thing, psychological pain needs first not to be eliminated, but understood. From this perspective, depression is less like a tumour and more like a stabbing pain in your abdomen: it’s telling you something, and you need to find out what. (No responsible GP would just pump you with painkillers and send you home.) And happiness – if such a thing is even achievable – is a much murkier matter. We don’t really know our own minds, and we often have powerful motives for keeping things that way. We see life through the lens of our earliest relationships, though we usually don’t realise it; we want contradictory things; and change is slow and hard. Our conscious minds are tiny iceberg-tips on the dark ocean of the unconscious – and you can’t truly explore that ocean by means of CBT’s simple, standardised, science-tested steps.</p> <p>This viewpoint has much romantic appeal. But the analysts’ arguments fell on deaf ears so long as experiment after experiment seemed to confirm the superiority of CBT – which helps explain the shocked response to <a href=\"https://uit.no/Content/418448/The%20effect%20of%20CBT%20is%20falling.pdf\" title=\"\">a study, published last May</a>, that seemed to show CBT getting less and less effective, as a treatment for depression, over time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Psychoanalysts contend that for one thing, psychological pain needs first not to be eliminated, but understood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Examining scores of earlier experimental trials, two researchers from Norway concluded that its effect size – a technical measure of its usefulness – had fallen by half since 1977. (In the unlikely event that this trend were to persist, it could be entirely useless in a few decades.) Had CBT somehow benefited from a kind of placebo effect all along, effective only so long as people believed it was a miracle cure?</p> <p>That puzzle was still being digested when researchers at London’s Tavistock clinic published results in October from the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20267/pdf\" title=\"\">first rigorous NHS study of long-term psychoanalysis</a> as a treatment for chronic depression. For the most severely depressed, it concluded, 18 months of analysis worked far better – and with much longer-lasting effects – than “treatment as usual” on the NHS, which included some CBT. Two years after the various treatments ended, 44% of analysis patients no longer met the criteria for major depression, compared to one-tenth of the others. Around the same time, <a href=\"http://www.svd.se/ensidig-satsning-pa-kbt-skadar-svensk-psykvard/om/debatt\" title=\"\">the Swedish press reported a finding from government auditors there</a>: that a multimillion pound scheme to reorient mental healthcare towards CBT had proved completely ineffective in meeting its goals.</p> <p>Such findings, it turns out, aren’t isolated – and in their midst, a newly emboldened band of psychoanalytic therapists are pressing the case that CBT’s pre-eminence has been largely built on sand. Indeed, they argue that teaching people to “think themselves to wellness” might sometimes make things worse. “Every thoughtful person knows that self-understanding isn’t something you get from the drive-thru,” said Jonathan Shedler, a psychologist at the University of Colorado medical school, who is one of CBT’s most unsparing critics. His default bearing is one of wry good humour, but exasperation ruffled his demeanour whenever our conversation dwelt too long on CBT’s claims of supremacy. “Novelists and poets seemed to have understood this truth for thousands of years. It’s only in the last few decades that people have said, ‘Oh, no, in 16 sessions we can change lifelong patterns!’” If Shedler and others are right, it may be time for psychologists and therapists to re-evaluate much of what they thought they knew about therapy: about what works, what doesn’t, and whether CBT has really consigned the cliche of the chin-stroking shrink – and with it, Freud’s picture of the human mind – to history. The impact of such a re-evaluation could be profound; eventually, it might even change how millions of people around the world are treated for psychological problems.</p> <p>How does that make you feel?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>“Freud was full of horseshit!”</strong> the therapist Albert Ellis, arguably the progenitor of CBT, liked to say. It’s hard to deny he had a point. One big part of the problem for psychoanalysis has been the evidence that its founder was something of a charlatan, prone to distorting his findings, or worse. (In one<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/06/science/as-a-therapist-freud-fell-short-scholars-find.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\"> especially eye-popping case, which only came to light in the 1990s</a>, Freud told a patient, the American psychiatrist Horace Frink, that his misery stemmed from an inability to recognise that he was homosexual – and hinted that the solution lay in making a large financial contribution to Freud’s work.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc38218523541388eb67277f4bbf4074404b5639\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bc38218523541388eb67277f4bbf4074404b5639/0_0_6075_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Gamlen therapy illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But for those challenging psychoanalysis with alternative approaches to therapy, even more troublesome was the sense that even the most sincere psychoanalyst is always engaged in a guessing-game, always prone to finding “proof” of his or her hunches, whether it’s there or not. The basic premise of psychoanalysis, after all, is that our lives are ruled by unconscious forces, which speak to us only indirectly: through symbols in dreams, “accidental” slips of the tongue, or through what infuriates us about others, which is a clue to what we can’t face in ourselves. But all this makes the whole thing unfalsifiable. Protest to your shrink that, no, you don’t really hate your father, and that just shows how desperate you must be to avoid admitting to yourself that you do.</p> <p>This problem of self-fulfilling prophecies is a disaster for anyone hoping to figure out, in a scientific way, what’s really going on in the mind – and by the 1960s, advances in scientific psychology had reached a point at which patience with psychoanalysis began to run out. Behaviourists such as BF Skinner had already shown that human behaviour could be predictably manipulated, much like that of pigeons or rats, by means of punishment and reward. The burgeoning “cognitive revolution” in psychology held that goings-on inside the mind could be measured and manipulated too. And since the 1940s, there had been a pressing need to do so: thousands of soldiers returning from the second world war exhibited emotional disturbances that cried out for rapid, cost-effective treatment, not years of conversation on the couch.</p> <p>Before laying the groundwork for CBT, Albert Ellis had in fact originally trained as a psychoanalyst. But after practising for some years in New York in the 1940s, he found his patients weren’t getting better – and so, with a self-confidence that would come to define his career, he concluded that analysis, rather than his own abilities, must be to blame. Along with other like-minded therapists, he turned instead to the ancient philosophy of Stoicism, teaching clients that it was their beliefs about the world, not events themselves, that distressed them. Getting passed over for a promotion might induce unhappiness, but depression came from the irrational tendency to generalise from that single setback to an image of oneself as an all-round failure. “As I see it,” <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/24/AR2007072402199.html\" title=\"\">Ellis told an interviewer decades later</a>, “psychoanalysis gives clients a cop-out. They don’t have to change their ways … they get to talk about themselves for 10 years, blaming their parents and waiting for magic-bullet insights.”</p> <p>Thanks to the breezy, no-nonsense tone adopted by CBT’s proponents, it’s easy to miss how revolutionary its claims were. For traditional psychoanalysts – and those who practise newer “psychodynamic” techniques, largely derived from traditional psychoanalysis – what happens in therapy is that seemingly irrational symptoms, such as the endless repetition of self-defeating patterns in love or work, are revealed to be at least somewhat rational. They’re responses that made sense in the context of the patient’s earliest experience. (If a parent abandoned you, years ago, it’s not so strange to live in constant dread that your spouse might do so too – and thus to act in ways that screw up your marriage as a result.) CBT flips that on its head. Emotions that might appear rational – such as feeling depressed about what a catastrophe your life is – stand exposed as the result of irrational thinking. Sure, you lost your job; but it doesn’t follow that everything will be awful forever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6974b168b98701eddfc24ca2700363480ecdf676\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6974b168b98701eddfc24ca2700363480ecdf676/167_207_2433_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Gamlen therapy illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"829\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If this second approach is right, change is clearly far simpler: you need only identify and correct various thought-glitches, rather than decoding the secret reasons for your suffering. Symptoms such as sadness or anxiety aren’t necessarily meaningful clues to long-buried fears; they’re intruders to be banished. In analysis, the relationship between therapist and patient serves as a kind of petri dish, in which the patient re-enacts her habitual ways of relating with others, enabling them to be better understood. In CBT, you’re just trying to get rid of a problem.</p> <p>The sweary, freewheeling Ellis was destined to remain an outsider, but the approach he pioneered soon attained respectability thanks to Aaron Beck, a sober-minded psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania. (Now 94, Beck has probably never called anything “horseshit” in his life.) In 1961, Beck devised a 21-point questionnaire, known as the <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/beck-depression.aspx\" title=\"\">Beck Depression Inventory</a>, to quantify clients’ suffering – and showed that, in about half of all cases, a few months of CBT relieved the worst symptoms. Objections from analysts were dismissed, with some justification, as the complaints of people trying to protect their lucrative turf. They found themselves compared to 19th-century medical doctors – bungling improvisers, threatened and offended by the notion that their mystical art could be reduced to a sequence of evidence-based steps.</p> <p>Many more studies followed, demonstrating the benefits of CBT in treating everything from depression to obsessive-compulsive disorder to post-traumatic stress. “I went to the early seminars on cognitive therapy to satisfy myself that it was another approach that wouldn’t work,” David Burns, who went on to popularise CBT in his worldwide bestseller Feeling Good, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/26/david-burns-cognitive-therapy-burkeman\" title=\"\">told me in 2010</a>. “But I passed the techniques to my patients – and people who’d seemed hopeless and stuck for years began to recover.”</p> <p>There’s little doubt that CBT has helped millions, at least to some degree. This has been especially true in the UK since the economist Richard Layard, a vigorous CBT evangelist, became Tony Blair’s “happiness czar”. By 2012, <a href=\"http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/silo/files/iapt-3-year-report.pdf\" title=\"\">more than a million people</a> had received free therapy as a result of the initiative Layard helped push through, working with the Oxford psychologist David Clark. Even if CBT wasn’t particularly effective, you might argue, that kind of reach would count for a lot. Yet it’s hard to shake the sense that something big is missing from its model of the suffering mind. After all, we experience our own inner lives, and our relationships with others, as bewilderingly complex. Arguably the entire history of both religion and literature is an attempt to grapple with what it all means; neuroscience daily reveals new subtleties in the workings of the brain. Could the answer to our woes really be something as superficial-sounding as “identifying automatic thoughts” or “modifying your self-talk” or “challenging your inner critic”? Could therapy really be so straightforward that you could receive it not from a human but from a book, or a computer?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Could therapy really be so straightforward that you could receive it not from a human but from a book, or a computer?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few years ago, after CBT had started to dominate taxpayer-funded therapy in Britain, a woman I’ll call Rachel, from Oxfordshire, sought therapy on the NHS for depression, following the birth of her first child. She was sent first to sit through a group PowerPoint presentation, promising five steps to “improve your mood”; then she received CBT from a therapist and, in between sessions, via computer. “I don’t think anything has ever made me feel as lonely and isolated as having a computer program ask me how I felt on a scale of one to five, and – after I’d clicked the sad emoticon on the screen – telling me it was ‘sorry to hear that’ in a prerecorded voice,” Rachel recalled. Completing CBT worksheets under a human therapist’s guidance wasn’t much better. “With postnatal depression,” she said, “you’ve gone from a situation in which you’ve been working, earning your own money, doing interesting things – and suddenly you’re at home on your own, mostly covered in sick, with no adult to talk to.” What she needed, she sees now, was real connection: that fundamental if hard-to-express sense of being held in the mind of another person, even if only for a short period each week.</p> <p>“I may be mentally ill,” Rachel said, “but I do know that a computer does not feel bad for me.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Jonathan Shedler remembers where</strong> he was when he first realised there might be something to the psychoanalytic idea of the mind as a realm far more complex, and peculiar, than most of us imagine. He was an undergraduate, at college in Massachusetts, when a psychology lecturer astonished him by interpreting a dream Shedler had related – about driving on bridges over lakes, and trying on hats in a shop – as an expression of the fear of pregnancy. The lecturer was exactly right: Shedler and his girlfriend, whose dream it was, were at that moment waiting to learn if she was pregnant, and desperately hoping she wasn’t. But the lecturer knew none of this context; he was apparently just an expert interpreter of the symbolism of dreams. “The impact could not have been greater,” <a href=\"http://www.jonathanshedler.com/PDFs/Shedler%20(2006)%20That%20was%20then,%20this%20is%20now%20R9.pdf\" title=\"\">Shedler recalled</a>, if his “words had been heralded by celestial trumpets.” He decided that “if there were people in the world who understood such things, I had to be one of them.”</p> <p>Yet academic psychology, the field Shedler next entered, meant having that kind of enthusiasm for the mysteries of the mind drummed out of you; researchers, he concluded, were committed to quantification and measurement, but not to the inner lives of real people. To become a psychoanalyst takes years of training, and it’s compulsory to undergo analysis yourself; studying the mind at university, by contrast, requires zero real-life experience. (Shedler is now that rarity, a trained therapist and researcher, who bridges both worlds.) “You know that thing about how you need 10,000 hours of practice to develop an expertise?” he asked. “Well, most of the researchers making pronouncements [about which therapies work] don’t have 10 hours!”</p> <p>Shedler’s subsequent research and writing has played a significant role in undermining the received wisdom that there’s no hard evidence for psychoanalysis. But it’s undeniable that the early psychoanalysts were sniffy about research: they were prone to viewing themselves as embattled practitioners of a subversive art that needed nurturing in specialist institutions – which in practice meant forming cliquish private bodies, and rarely interacting with university experimenters. Research into cognitive approaches thus got a big head start – and it was the 1990s before empirical studies of psychoanalytic techniques began hinting that the cognitive consensus might be flawed. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15583112\" title=\"\">In 2004, a meta-analysis concluded</a> that short-term psychoanalytic approaches were at least as good as other routes for many ailments, leaving recipients better off than 92% of all patients prior to therapy. In 2006, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17054212\" title=\"\">a study tracking approximately 1,400 people</a> suffering from depression, anxiety and related conditions ruled in favour of short-term psychodynamic therapy, too. And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347003\" title=\"\">a 2008 study into borderline personality disorder</a> concluded that only 13% of psychodynamic patients still had the diagnosis five years after the end of treatment, compared with 87% of the others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed546011a82937b91b12ac1609bd31882461ef4f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ed546011a82937b91b12ac1609bd31882461ef4f/0_0_3388_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Gamlen therapy illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These studies haven’t always compared analytic therapies with cognitive ones; the comparison is often with “treatment as usual”, a phrase that covers a multitude of sins. But again and again, as <a href=\"http://jonathanshedler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shedler-2015-Where-is-the-evidence-for-evidence-based-therapy-R.pdf\" title=\"\">Shedler has argued</a>, the starkest differences between the two emerge some time after therapy has finished. Ask how people are doing as soon as their treatment ends, and CBT looks convincing. Return months or years later, though, and the benefits have often faded, while the effects of psychoanalytic therapies remain, or have even increased – suggesting that they may restructure the personality in a lasting way, rather than simply helping people manage their moods. In the <a href=\"http://tavistockandportman.uk/about-us/research/current-research-projects/adult-depression-study-tads\" title=\"\">NHS study conducted at the Tavistock clinic</a> last year, chronically depressed patients receiving psychoanalytic therapy stood a 40% better chance of going into partial remission, during every six-month period of the research, than those receiving other treatments.</p> <p>Alongside this growing body of evidence, scholars have begun to ask pointed questions about the studies that first fuelled CBT’s ascendancy. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15250817\" title=\"\">In a provocative 2004 paper</a>, the Atlanta-based psychologist Drew Westen and his colleagues showed how researchers – motivated by the desire for an experiment with clearly interpretable results – had often excluded up to two-thirds of potential participants, typically because they had multiple psychological problems. The practice is understandable: when a patient has more than one problem, it’s harder to untangle the lines of cause and effect. But it may mean that the people who do get studied are extremely atypical. In real life, our psychological problems are intricately embedded in our personalities. The issue you bring to therapy (depression, say) may not be the one that emerges after several sessions (for example, the need to come to terms with a sexual orientation you fear your family won’t accept). Moreover, some studies have sometimes seemed to unfairly stack the deck, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855048\" title=\"\">as when CBT has been compared with “psychodynamic therapy”</a> delivered by graduate students who’d received only a few days’ cursory training in it, from other students.</p> <p>But the most incendiary charge against cognitive approaches, from the torchbearers of psychoanalysis, is that they might actually make things worse: that finding ways to manage your depressed or anxious thoughts, for example, may simply postpone the point at which you’re driven to take the plunge into self-understanding and lasting change. CBT’s implied promise is that there’s a relatively simple, step-by-step way to gain mastery over suffering. But perhaps there’s more to be gained from acknowledging how little control – over our lives, our emotions, and other people’s actions – we really have? The promise of mastery is seductive not just for patients but therapists, too. “Clients are anxious about being in therapy, and inexperienced therapists are anxious because they don’t have a clue what to do,” writes the US psychologist <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Why-Therapy-Works-Interpersonal-Neurobiology/dp/0393709051/\" title=\"\">Louis Cozolino in a new book, Why Therapy Works</a>. “Therefore, it is comforting for both parties to have a task they can focus on.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most incendiary charge against cognitive approaches is that they might actually make things worse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not surprisingly, leading proponents of CBT reject most of these criticisms, arguing that it’s been caricatured as superficial, and that some decrease in effectiveness is only to be expected, because it’s grown so much in popularity. Early studies used small samples and pioneering therapists, enthused by the new approach; more recent studies use bigger samples, and inevitably involve therapists with a wider range of talent levels. “People who say CBT is superficial have just missed the point,” said Trudie Chalder, professor of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy at the King’s College Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience in London, who argues that no single therapy is best for all maladies. “Yes, you’re targeting people’s beliefs, but you’re not just targeting easily accessible beliefs. It’s not just ‘Oh, that person looked at me peculiarly, so they must not like me’; it’s beliefs like ‘I’m an unlovable person’, which may derive from early experience. The past is very much taken into account.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, the dispute won’t be settled by adjudicating between clashing studies: it goes deeper than that. Experimenters may reach wildly different conclusions about which therapies have the best outcomes. But what should count as a successful outcome anyway? Studies measure relief of symptoms – yet a crucial premise of psychoanalysis is that there’s more to a meaningful life than being symptom-free. In principle, you might even end a course of psychoanalysis sadder – though wiser, more conscious of your previously unconscious responses, and living in a more engaged way – and still deem the experience a success. Freud famously declared that his goal was the transformation of “neurotic misery into common unhappiness”. Carl Jung said “humanity needs difficulties: they are necessary for health.” Life is painful. Should we be thinking in terms of a “cure” for painful emotions at all?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>There’s something deeply appealing</strong> about the idea that therapy shouldn’t be approached as a matter of science – that our individual lives are too distinctive to be submitted to the relentless generalisation by which science must proceed. That sentiment may help explain the commercial success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/the-examined-life-stephen-grosz-review\" title=\"\">The Examined Life</a>, Stephen Grosz’s 2013 collection of tales from the analyst’s couch, which spent weeks on UK bestseller lists and has been translated into more than 30 languages. Its chapters consist not of experimental findings or clinical diagnoses, but of stories, many of which involve a jolt of insight as the patient suddenly gets a sense of the depths he or she contains. There’s the man who lies compulsively, in a bid for secret intimacy with those he can persuade to join him in deceit, just like his mother hid evidence of his bedwetting; and the woman who finally realises how effortfully she’s been denying the evidence of her husband’s infidelity when she notices how neatly someone has stacked the dishwasher.</p> <p>“Each life is unique, and your role, as an analyst, is to find the unique story of the patient,” Grosz told me. “There are so many things that only come out through slips of the tongue, through someone confiding a fantasy, or using a certain word.” The analyst’s job is to stay watchfully receptive to it all – and then, from such ingredients, “help people make meaning of their lives.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14479fabe195094bf1ec8bacb2b6de96793c639f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/14479fabe195094bf1ec8bacb2b6de96793c639f/4_175_2788_4181/667.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Gamlen therapy illustration\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Surprisingly, perhaps, recent support for this seemingly unscientific perspective has emerged from the most empirical corner of the study of the mind: neuroscience. Many neuroscience experiments have indicated that the brain processes information much faster than conscious awareness can keep track of it, so that countless mental operations run, in the neuroscientist David Eagleman’s phrase, “under the hood” – unseen by the conscious mind in the driving-seat. For that reason, as Louis Cozolino writes in Why Therapy Works, “by the time we become consciously aware of an experience, it has already been processed many times, activated memories, and initiated complex patterns of behaviour.”</p> <p>Depending on how you interpret the evidence, it would seem we can do countless complex things – from performing mental arithmetic, to hitting a car’s brakes to avoid a collision, to making a choice of marriage partner – before becoming aware that we’ve done them. This doesn’t mesh well with a basic assumption of CBT – that, with training, we can learn to catch most of our unhelpful mental responses in the act. Rather, it seems to confirm the psychoanalytic intuition that the unconscious is huge, and largely in control; and that we live, unavoidably, through lenses created in the past, which we can only hope to modify partially, slowly and with great effort.</p> <p>Perhaps the only undeniable truth to emerge from disputes among therapists is that we still don’t have much of a clue how minds work. When it comes to easing mental suffering, “it’s like we’ve got a hammer, a saw, a nail-gun and a loo brush, and this box that doesn’t always work properly, so we just keep hitting the box with each of these tools to see what works,” said Jules Evans, policy director for the Centre for the History of Emotions at Queen Mary, University of London.</p> <p>This may be why many scholars have been drawn to what has become known as the “dodo-bird verdict”: the idea, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12063144\" title=\"\">supported by some studies</a>, that the specific kind of therapy makes little difference. (The name comes from the Dodo’s pronouncement in Alice in Wonderland: “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”) What seems to matter much more is the presence of a compassionate, dedicated therapist, and a patient committed to change; if one therapy is better than all others for all or even most problems, it has yet to be discovered. David Pollens, in his Upper East Side consulting room, said he had some sympathy for that verdict, despite his passion for psychoanalysis. “There was a wonderful British analyst, Michael Balint, who was very involved in medical training, and he had a question he liked to pose [to doctors],” Pollens said. It was: “‘What do you think is the most powerful medication you prescribe?’ And people would try to answer that, and then eventually he’d say: ‘the relationship’.”</p> <p>Yet even this conclusion – that we simply don’t know which therapies work best – might be seen as a point in favour of Freud and his successors. Psychoanalysis, after all, embodies just this awed humility about how little we can ever grasp about the workings of our minds. (The one question nobody can ever answer, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PUzYWfbf-qkC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=%22of+what+are+you+unconscious%22+hollis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rfmLe86RXg&amp;sig=X5S6kA5PdeR9hhjpzWks7JEhlwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22of%20what%20are%20you%20unconscious%22%20hollis&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">writes the Jungian analyst James Hollis</a>, is “of what are you unconscious?”) Freud the man scaled heights of arrogance. But his legacy is a reminder that we shouldn’t necessarily expect life to be all that happy, nor to assume we can ever really know what’s going on inside – indeed, that we’re often deeply emotionally invested in preserving our ignorance of unsettling truths.</p> <p>“What happens in therapy,” Pollens said, “is that people come in asking for help, and then the very next thing they do is they try to stop you helping them.” His smile hinted at the element of absurdity in the situation – and in the whole therapeutic undertaking, perhaps. “How do we help a person when they’ve told you, in one way or another, ‘Don’t help me’? That’s what analytic treatment is about.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhy3","wordcount":"5090","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7d5eefc1c72bb45c0a97541eec939fef276ac537/0_0_2560_1536/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-10T06:00:01Z","standfirst":"Cheap and effective, CBT became the dominant form of therapy, consigning Freud to psychology’s dingy basement.

In order to fully exercise the right to freedom of expression, individuals must be able to communicate without fear of intrusion by the state,” they write.</p> <p>“Under international law, the right to freedom of expression also protects speech that some may find shocking, offensive or disturbing. Importantly, the right to freedom of expression means that those who feel offended also have the right to challenge others through free debate and open discussion, or through peaceful protest.”</p> <p>The 78 free-speech organisations call on all governments to protect freedom of expression, “especially for journalists, writers, artists and human rights defenders to publish, write and speak freely”, and to repeal legislation that “restricts the right to legitimate freedom of expression, especially vague and overbroad national security, sedition, obscenity, blasphemy and criminal defamation laws, and other legislation used to imprison, harass and silence critical voices, including on social media and online”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24d3a60499ec463f1a9951368b442f7959d048f1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/24d3a60499ec463f1a9951368b442f7959d048f1/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Charlie Hebdo anniversary edition represents God as a terrorist bearing a gun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Charlie Hebdo anniversary edition represents God as a terrorist bearing a gun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Signatories to the statement include <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/\">Article 19</a>, the <a href=\"http://ipi.freemedia.at/\">International Press Institute</a> and the PEN American Center, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/salman-rushdie-pen-charlie-hebdo-peter-carey\">faced upheaval last year over its decision to honour Charlie Hebdo</a> as winner of its “freedom of expression courage award”. <a href=\"http://www.pen.org/blog/pen-receives-letter-members-about-charlie-hebdo-award\">More than 240 writers</a> put their names to a letter last year claiming the choice was “not simply conveying support for freedom of expression, but also valorising … material that intensifies the anti-Islamic, anti-Maghreb, anti-Arab sentiments already prevalent in the western world”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/04/charlie-hebdo-anniversary-edition-cover-is-released-one-year-after-attacks\">Charlie Hebdo anniversary edition cover released: 'the assassin is still out there'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It was important for us to put clearly what is the position of PEN – which is freedom of speech over all,” said Emmanuel Pierrat, the French author and freedom of expression lawyer who has acted for Charlie Hebdo. “[The decision to give the prize to Charlie Hebdo] was contested, but is not contested any more.”</p> <p>Pierrat added that he liked the anniversary edition cover of the magazine, which represents God as a terrorist bearing a gun, and which has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/06/charlie-hebdo-anniversary-cover-disrespects-all-faiths-vatican-newspaper-says\">criticised by the Vatican</a>. “Charlie Hebdo is on the same lines as ever – a line against dictatorship of religion and of ideology,” said Pierrat.</p> <p>“A year ago today, the Charlie Hebdo staff chose courage and freedom over self-censorship and fear,” said the Mexican-American writer Jennifer Clement, president of PEN International. “All over the world we are experiencing the cruelty of zealots who now have access to military weapons as well as violent repression from state and non-state actors. Because of this, self-censorship is also increasing due to fear.”</p> <p>“Truth cannot be known and examined without freedom of expression and so freedom of expression is also knowledge. The Charlie Hebdo staff refused to stop their work and dared, in the face of death, to practise freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to laugh.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 7 January 2015.

Did you ever sit next to a radio/stereo/computer with a notepad, a few tracks in mind, and a heart that beats? How about the thrill of receiving one? Well, w</em><em>e’ve asked some of our favorite authors to make us a mixtape. </em><em>This month’s installment is from <a href=\"http://samanthajhunt.blogspot.com.es/\">Samantha Hunt</a>, whose new novel, </em><a href=\"http://www.hmhco.com/shop/books/Mr-Splitfoot/9780544526709\">Mr. Splitfoot</a> (<em>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</em>), comes out<em> <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360593/s/mr-splitfoot/\">this week</a>.

It is a soundtrack to carry one through each stage of creepy cult life.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This mixtape is an instruction manual, How to Be a Deranged Cult Leader. My novel, Mr. Splitfoot<em>,</em> is two novels, fraternal twins. One is a walk through haunted places: the odd jewels of a backwater, the late Erie Canal or the verge of motherhood. The second exhumes the ghosts of American huckster faiths. In a fundamentalist group home, child con men talk to the dead. While writing Mr. Splitfoot, I built my own religion to understand how it’s done. I collected the things I love like outer space, geology, mountains, and vinyl records. I came up with the Etherists. Their holy texts sample the Bible, the Book of Mormon, a classic rock radio station at 2 AM in Troy, New York circa 1978 and Carl Sagan’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/26/science-writing-cosmos-carl-sagan\">Cosmos</a>. And while I like many things about the Etherists, their leader is a bad, bad man. Power corrupts, power corrodes a person’s insides. This mixtape examines that corruption. It is a soundtrack to carry one through each stage of creepy cult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:dwyer.murphy:playlist:5k2QXbDjT4zBWlpj0PInqw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Seduction</strong></h2> <p><em>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2S1nmxYmUg\">Have You Never Been Mellow?</a>, </em>Olivia Newton John</p> <p>The lyrics to this song could be printed in a recruitment brochure and your job would be done. “There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are. I was like you. I don’t mean to make you frown. I just want you to slow down.” But the part of this track that seals the deal (other than ONJ’s ethereal, hypnotic vocals) is the series of questions posed in the chorus, questions that any tired soul will be so grateful to hear asked. “Have you never been mellow? Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside? Have you never been happy just to hear your song? Have you never let someone else be strong?” While it’s unusual to acknowledge submission is beneficial, you, as a cult leader, might want to make it the first thing you say in the morning, the last words you whisper at night. Even if you don’t mean it.<strong> </strong></p> <p><em>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9qpERA1kJM\">Trafalgar</a></em>, The Bee Gees</p> <p>A song both triumphant and melancholy that says, without us, you are lost and here is brotherly harmony in the form of Barry, Maurice and Robin. “I need someone to know me and to show me” is the hole each potential cult member strives to fill, while the refrain, “Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don’t let me down” focuses on a word that makes no sense to an American cult member and so can be used in a mantra-like way, in accordance with the best cult-building advice: keep it vague, keep it mysterious. Stop making sense. Trafalgar. Trafalgar. Trafalgar. Trafalgar. Trafalgar.</p> <h2><strong>Brainwashing/Hypnosis</strong></h2> <p><em>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1gvnCVgguQ\">Love Letters</a></em>, Ketty Lester</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing has the power to brainwash quite as effectively as love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nothing has the power to brainwash quite as effectively as love. Consider the teenage crush an attempt to harness this wild force. Ketty Lester, the most beautiful woman in the world, with a voice as powerful, will assist you. The repetition and modulation of doo wop is the essence of hypnosis and Lester casts a spell with the lyric, “I’ll memorize every line and I’ll kiss the name that you sign.” That’s witchcraft. That’s good. Here’s an idea: you could spend an entire day playing all the versions of this song for your new recruit/convert. They are many and various: Dick Haymes, Joni James, Cilla Black, Bobby Darin, Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley, Billy Thorpe and The Aztecs, Joe Walsh, Alison Moyet, Boz Scaggs, Frankie Miller, Ketty Lester. After that the new recruit will either be in love with you or will have gone insane, which might be just as effective.</p> <p><em>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCf23ZTFaDM\">Rocket Man</a></em>, Elton John</p> <p>As this is the period of induction and conversion for your followers, think in terms of electricity. Think scientifically or, even better, scientifical as, in a cult, it’s best to use words that only kind of make sense. John’s Rocket Man is well suited to welcome new members to your fold as it is both familiar and completely strange. The lyrics are creepy. We’re told he misses the Earth so much, yet, it’s going to be a long, long time before he returns. Why? “I’m not the man they think I am at home.” Then who are you? “All this science I don’t understand.” No, of course you don’t. Good thing I’m here.</p> <h2><strong>Take Control</strong></h2> <p><em>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jB3zzv2G6Y\">Oh, Daddy</a></em>, Fleetwood Mac</p> <p>Here’s where the power dynamic really shifts. Now’s the time to exploit your followers’ self-hatred. Everyone’s got some and your job is to turn it up. “Oh, Daddy. How can you love me? I don’t understand why?” Once you explain how you have special powers to love even people as lowly and underserving and lost as your followers, you can expect to hear Christie McVie’s refrain in response. “Why are you right when I’m so wrong? I’m so weak and you’re so strong.” I know, might be an appropriate answer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jB3zzv2G6Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jB3zzv2G6Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><em>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9TXjIadhq0\">Into the Night</a></em>, Benny Mardones</p> <p>This is also the time to begin planting ideas such as, God wants me to have a harem. Really, that’s what God said and for this Benny Mardones could come in handy. “She’s just sixteen years old…but if I could fly I’d take you up, I’d take you into the night and show you love.” Which brings me to…</p> <h2><strong>The Spiritual Honeymoon</strong></h2> <p><em>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeqtAB1WgEw\">Baby Give it Up</a></em>, KC and the Sunshine Band</p> <p>What works better than a pop-fueled dance track to convey the message, You are awesome! No one belongs here more than you! Just keep doing what you do (especially if that involves swallowing lots of drugs and signing over your bank account to me!) This song is pure affirmation. “Everybody wants you. Everybody wants your love.” And who can forget the mysterious album cover art? KC, in his bright blue jazz shoes, has caught a woman in his arms. While her shapely gams are exposed, her entire head is covered by a magenta scarf sending an important message, You can dance but try not to think too much.</p> <h2><strong>Sex</strong></h2> <p><em>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgEAAGiifDM\">Sex Planet</a></em>, R. Kelly</p> <p>Up next, freaky orgy. “Jupiter, Pluto, Venus and Saturn…I’ve got the control…once I enter your black hole…We’ll be gone for hours. I won’t stop until I give you meteor showers.” I appreciate how Kelly, like my cult in <em>Mr. Splitfoot</em>, exploits the mysteries of outer space in his pursuit of pleasure. Remember, followers like to feel they are doing something more important than just getting the leader off. They are on a mission.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love Linda Thompson.

I love her. She survived life in a cultish sect of mystical Sufis where all the food was prepared by women. She built a family and a career only to lose her voice as her marriage dissolved and she still has a great sense of humor and love. I am very interested in what it means for women to be silent. Cults are excellent places to study this and this song raise questions about the boundary of the self. So, now that you have followers, it’s time to put them to work. Whether it’s selling roses by the side of the road or producing toxic gases in your chemistry lab, everyone must suffer for progress. Except you. And this song’s lyrics, “This grindstone’s wearing me. Your claws are tearing me. Don’t use me endlessly,” could be helpful in realigning any followers who might wonder why they are doing all the work.</p> <h2><strong>Disguising your income</strong></h2> <p><em>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcuAw77J8_Y\">Arab Money</a>,</em> Busta Rhymes</p> <p>A perfectly confusing song for cult life. BR raps parts of the Qur’an. “Alhamdulillah” (all Praises to God) rhymes with: “My billions piling.” Could be a helpful piece when obscuring the source of your wealth, especially if you are, say, drugging your followers, removing their kidneys and selling the organs on the black market.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcuAw77J8_Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bcuAw77J8_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Spiritual Zombie/Divine Madness/Paranoia</strong></h2> <p><em>11. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98qq5Cvrst8\">Moon Maiden</a></em>, Duke Ellington</p> <p>Just Duke and a celeste. Duke’s vocal debut, on the occasion of the Apollo 11, is accompanied by an instrument that sounds like a fairy tale gone deeply dark and twisted. Just like you. So this is where things start to fall apart. Did you take too many drugs? Probably. And even if you didn’t, all this power-tripping has pickled your brain. Aliens are all around. No one can be trusted and there are girls on the moon. But, they might want to kill you.</p> <p><em>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XQq_qmwBMg\">Le Goudron</a></em>, Brigitte Fontaine</p> <p>Really you should have been playing Fontaine’s records right from the start. She’s hypnotic and her lyrics only kind of make sense. “Time is a boat and the world is a cake.” Plus, she’s French anyway so likely no one will understand. Playing her records, you can pretend you are equally interested in hearing women’s voices speak, women’s thoughts, while the whole time you’re actually keeping dangerous female ideas trapped in a vinyl groove. This helps to convince your female cult members of their great value in your harem because who else is going to do all the cooking and cleaning? You? No, I didn’t think so and speaking of cooking…</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Destruction</strong></h2> <p><em>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr7Qyag0vqE\">Cooking With Satan</a></em>, Sun City Girls</p> <p>The ATF is at your door or else you’re stirring up the cyanide Flavor-aid.

What a ridiculous, embarrassing debacle.”</p> <p>Sfar <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/joann-sfar/bd-angouleme_b_8920740.html\">wrote</a>: “I simply don’t want to be part of a ceremony that is so disconnected from the current reality of comics art.” </p> <p>Several French government ministers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pascaleboistard/status/684434039244218368\">tweeted</a> their support of the boycott. Fleur Pellerin, the culture minister, said the lack of women shortlisted was abnormal and a little perturbing. </p> <p>The row echoed the protests over the absence of female directors from the shortlist for the Palme d’Or prize at the Cannes film festival in 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"759a31f0a86446e065a45d989dbd1aedf3d3682c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/759a31f0a86446e065a45d989dbd1aedf3d3682c/0_0_3000_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joann Sfar sitting on some stairs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joann Sfar: ‘I don’t want to be part of a ceremony that is so disconnected from the current reality of comics art.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Bruque/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Questioned by <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/bande-dessinee/article/2016/01/05/le-festival-de-bd-d-angouleme-accuse-de-sexisme-apres-une-selection-100-masculine_4842193_4420272.html#koYJHbkfuVdxg5XF.99\">Le Monde</a>, Franck Bondoux, of the Angoulême festival, said: “The concept of the grand prix is to reward an author for their whole <em>oeuvre</em>. When you look at the prize list, you can see the artists on it have a certain maturity and a certain age. Unfortunately, there are few women in the history of comics art. It’s a reality. If you go to the Louvre, you’ll equally find very few women artists.”</p> <p>This explanation was rejected by commentators and female artists, who cited increasing numbers of acclaimed women in the industry. </p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fhkg","wordcount":"593","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7feafe7b820f48aa702e28710b9f068c98baefe4/3_10_5150_3090/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-09T14:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Angoulême says it will add female nominees after Daniel Clowes, Joann Sfar and Riad Sattouf pull out in protest</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/comic-book-artists-pull-out-award-protest-all-male-shortlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/jan/06/comic-book-artists-pull-out-award-protest-all-male-shortlist","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"7feafe7b820f48aa702e28710b9f068c98baefe4","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7feafe7b820f48aa702e28710b9f068c98baefe4/3_10_5150_3090/140.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/7feafe7b820f48aa702e28710b9f068c98baefe4","altText":"Daniel Clowes, Joann Sfar and Riad Sattouf.","caption":"Daniel Clowes, Joann Sfar and Riad Sattouf.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside
