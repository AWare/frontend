The stockpile has since been secured in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</p><p>The Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli has asked the Libyan authorities to ensure the concentrated uranium is used for the benefit of Libyans, in \"industrial and agricultural development and in the production of clean energy\".</p><p>Gaddafi signed the chemical weapons convention and joined the OPCW in 2004 as part of an ultimately abortive efforts to shake off pariah status and mend relations with the west.</p><p>Libya had 13 tonnes of mustard gas when it signed the treaty but Gaddafi claimed to have destroyed the munitions needed to deliver it. Gaddafi's regime destroyed about 54% of its mustard gas stocks and about 40% of the chemicals used to manufacture the substance, besides 3,500 bombs intended to deliver deadly chemicals.</p><p>The process, supervised by OPCW experts, resumed in 2012. It intensified in September 2013 with the signing of a deal with Washington, which was increasingly concerned that the stockpiles might fall into the hands of ex-rebel militias that the post-Gaddafi government has struggled to contain.</p><p>The Syrian disarmament operation, agreed to by Damascus in 2013 under threat of western military action, is running behind schedule, sparking mounting concern in Washington. Syria has declared around 700 tonnes of the most dangerous chemicals and they were supposed to have been shipped out by 31 December. Another 500 tonnes of less dangerous precursor chemicals are supposed to be shipped out by Wednesday.</p><p>But so far just two small shipments have left the Syrian port of Latakia, accounting for less than 4% of the country's declared arsenal of most dangerous chemicals and none of the precursors. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has warned President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that he could face consequences if he fails to meet his obligations on giving up the weapons.<br></p>","headline":"Libya says chemical weapons destroyed","trailText":"Government says country has been rid of weapons from Gaddafi era in process hailed by monitors as example for Syria <br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mf2q","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428938889","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f1c992e4b025fe0e2e665b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Agence France-Presse in Tripoli","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038364","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T05:36:29Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","tags":[{"id":"world/libya","webTitle":"Libya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/libya","references":[]},{"id":"world/chemical-weapons","webTitle":"Chemical weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/chemical-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e28d892f-d2a5-4b6f-ac5b-f39498c93df0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","source":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","photographer":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","altText":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.","height":"132","credit":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","caption":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.
