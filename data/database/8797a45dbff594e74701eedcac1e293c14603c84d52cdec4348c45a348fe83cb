CiU, which has governed the region for 25 of the 33 years since democracy was restored after the death of the dictator Franco, has never aspired to independence, preferring to wring more autonomy out of minority governments in Madrid.</p><p>Artur Mas, the Catalan president, initially said he had no intention of joining the march but now says he will attend in a personal capacity. An attempt by another senior CiU politician to justify his attendance at the rally by portraying it as pro-Catalan rather than pro-independence fell flat when Carme Forcadell, spokeswoman for the group behind the march, said: \"Anyone who attends should understand that they will be considered pro-independence.\"</p><p>Catalonia is one of 17 autonomous regions in Spain's federal system, which has come under attack from, among others, the European Central Bank, who have questioned the system's viability. Most of the regions have been run as virtual fiefdoms by local politicians hand in hand with the savings banks, almost of all of which are now bankrupt.

Catalans are, understandably, hurt by this. \"I'm fed up with the way we're criticised whatever we do,\" said Gemma Soler, a secretary. \"And I'm tired of having to justify myself wherever I go in the peninsula, that we're not the extremists they make us out to be, as if we went around burning cars and flags all the time.\"</p><p>Montse Agell, who works for a charitable foundation, said one of the reasons she was pro-independence was that \"basically, I don't want to live among people who don't like me\".</p>","headline":"Barcelona braces for million-strong march for Catalan independence","trailText":"<p>Mass rally marks watershed in Catalan independence movement and threatens rift with Spain's federal government</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347351195586/Catalan-flag-005.jpg","wordcount":"494","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"395958293","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6648197","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Stephen Burgen in Barcelona","internalPageCode":"1799505","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-09-12T10:45:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/barcelona-march-catalan-independence","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/11/barcelona-march-catalan-independence","tags":[{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stephen-burgen","webTitle":"Stephen Burgen","r2ContributorId":"39144","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-burgen","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/stephen-burgen","references":[]},{"id":"world/catalonia","webTitle":"Catalonia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catalonia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catalonia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-396025446","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347351190776/Catalan-flag-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Gustau Nacarino","altText":"Catalan flag","height":"54","credit":"Gustau Nacarino/Reuters","caption":"A grandmother hangs out a Catalan  flag in Sant Pere de Torello.

What we need to do is create jobs.\"</p><p>Carles Brugueras, a documentary film-maker said he was not a nationalist but favoured independence from a strictly economic perspective. \"For a long time, Catalonia has been generating a lot of resources for Spain but the fiscal balance has been very unfair,\" he said.</p><p>Laura Nuñez, a law student and also a new convert to independence, said she believed it would boost the Catalan economy. \"We're economically the most powerful part of Spain, because of industry and tourism, and we contribute more than other Spanish regions,\" she said. \"We shouldn't be subject to this internal discrimination.\"</p><p>The slogan for the march was \"Catalonia: a new European state\". But a European Union spokesman in Brussels pointed out that, were Catalonia to secede from Spain, it would have to leave the EU and could rejoin only if it met the economic criteria and if other member states voted unanimously in favour of its membership.</p><p>Whether Catalonia would be viable as an independent state is an open question. Much of Catalonia's wealth comes from tourism, but there are major industries in the region, as well as a significant multinational presence. Whether these firms would want to remain in a small state that was not part of Spain is unclear.</p><p>If the region continues to pursue independence, boycotts could follow, analysts warn. There was a damaging cava boycott in 2005, when Catalonia refused to back Madrid's bid for the 2012 Olympics.</p><p>The economist Xavier Cuadras warned: \"A large-scale boycott could cause a 40% drop in exports of consumer goods to Spain, and a sustained boycott could cost Catalonia 4% of its GDP.\" Spain accounts for 54% of the region's exports.</p><p>In sport, Catalans make much of the fact that half the victorious Spanish football team are Catalans. But it is doubtful whether many of those players would play for a small country that was unlikely to win anything at an international level. The same goes for the mighty Barcelona football club: if Catalonia were independent, it would be reduced to playing in a semi-professional league.</p><p>And not all Catalans are pro-independence. Some 40% of Catalans are Spanish immigrants – or the children of those immigrants – who fled poverty in rural Spain after the civil war and retain strong family and emotional ties with Spain. Then there are a further 1 million people (14% of the population) who are from other EU states, Latin America, Morocco, Pakistan and China. Very few of these, were they given the chance to vote, would back independence.</p><p>There is considerable antipathy in Spain towards the Catalans, who are widely perceived as rich, spoilt, constantly complaining and forever playing the victim. Catalans are, understandably, hurt by this. \"The rise in the pro-independence movement is directly related to the Spanish state's inability to include Catalonia,\" said Miquel Berga, professor of English literature at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. \"It seems to me that only a profound change in constitutional arrangements can address the prevailing sense of dissatisfaction.\"</p><p>Joan Fumaz, a chef, said: \"If we were independent, we wouldn't have to go on justifying ourselves. I'm Catalan. It would be nice not to have to explain that to people all the time.\"</p>","headline":"Catalan independence rally brings Barcelona to a standstill","trailText":"Surge in secessionist sentiment

A smaller group unfurled Spanish flags before the debate began, yelling \"Catalonia is Spain!\"</p><p>But the vote is also largely symbolic: Catalonia can ask Spain for permission to hold an independence vote but Madrid still has the power to say no, and it almost certainly will.</p><p>Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, has repeatedly said he won't allow a Catalonia secession referendum because Spain's 1978 constitution doesn't envision anything but a unified Spanish state, and mandates that referendums affecting Spain must be held nationally and not regionally. He has an absolute majority in parliament that assures he will prevail, and the main opposition Socialist party also opposes a referendum vote.</p><p>Still, the vote on Thursday could fan the flames of an already impassioned independence drive, even though it fell just short of the two-thirds majority that supporters hoped for. A strong separatist message may also inspire independence movements elsewhere in the European Union at a time when European unity has been rocked by the economic crisis.</p><p>Even if Madrid refuses to allow an independence vote, Catalan politicians might decide to try to hold a referendum anyway. That would put them in perilous legal terrain: when the northern Basque region, where separatist sentiment has also raged, failed to obtain permission for a similar referendum in 2005, Spain said Basque leaders could be jailed if they went ahead and held the vote anyway.</p><p>A less extreme scenario would be to use Catalan regional elections as a kind of unofficial referendum, with parties obliged to clearly state where they stand on independence. Under such a situation, any vote for a pro-independence party would be taken as a de facto vote for independence. A big yes turnout would give further ammunition to independence supporters to push for a referendum, with or without Spain's approval.</p>","headline":"Catalonia votes to ask Madrid for secession referendum","trailText":"Vote in Catalan parliament unlikely to lead to secession from Spain, but could fan flames of independence movement","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/16/1389869099360/Catalan-flag-006.jpg","wordcount":"351","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427228095","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8562166","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press in Barcelona","internalPageCode":"2027347","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-19T10:47:19Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/catalonia-vote-right-independence-referendum","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/16/catalonia-vote-right-independence-referendum","tags":[{"id":"world/catalonia","webTitle":"Catalonia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catalonia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catalonia","references":[]},{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427229000","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/16/1389869092324/Catalan-flag-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","source":"AP","photographer":"Emilio Morenatti","altText":"Catalan flag","suppliersReference":"EM103","height":"54","credit":"Emilio Morenatti/AP","caption":"A boy waves a Catalan 'estelada' flag during a pro-independence event in Barcelona.

His position is backed by Spain's constitutional court, which ruled last month that a referendum in the powerful north-eastern region could only take place if changes were made to Spain's constitution.</p><p>Tuesday's petition is expected to be voted down by 300 of the 350 parliamentarians, including those from Rajoy's People's party and the main opposition Socialists. Anticipating a no vote, Mas said earlier this week he would not attend the debate.</p><p>The vote is only the latest chapter in a political stalemate between Madrid and the Catalan government in Barcelona.\"From here, everything will continue the same. In the short-term, I don't see any significant changes,\" political analyst Josep Ramoneda told the Guaridan.</p><p>Less than two months ago, in a motion brought by the centrist Union for Progress and Democracy party, Spain's parliament torpedoed the Catalan government's independence drive, voting 272 to 43 to reject Catalonia's \"right to decide\".</p><p>The underlying problem, said Ramoneda, is that Spain cannot offer Mas the two elements he's looking for: a redistribution of power and the possibility that one day Catalonians could decide the region's fate in a referendum.</p><p>\"Without those two elements we continue in a situation of both saying their piece without heading in any clear direction. I don't see a way out,\" Ramoneda said.</p><p>Regardless of the vote's coutcome, Mas has vowed to push forward with the planned referendum in November. \"If they say no, they will say no to a law,\" Mas said on Sunday. \"But they can't block the will of the Catalan people.\"</p><p>The latest polls show that roughly half of Catalans support independence.</p><p>If Spanish courts shut down all possibilities of a referendum, Mas is widely expected to use the next elections in Catalonia as a de facto referendum on independence.</p><p>Spain's deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, said on Friday Madrid was open to dialogue, but reinforced the government's position that the final say on independence  cannot be limited to Catalans alone. \"Spaniards have the right to decide what Spain is. And only the entirety of Spaniards can decide that.\"</p><p>Fernando Vallespín, a political scientist with Madrid's Autónoma University, believes the opposition Socialists may have found a way to break the stalemate with their suggestion to give Catalonia greater autonomy but not full independence. Doing so would appeal to a large demographic in the region, Vallespín said, particularly those who \"don't want to leave Spain but want more out of the relationship between Spain and Catalonia\".</p>","headline":"Spain set to reject Catalonia's request for independence referendum","trailText":"<p>Parliament expected to vote overwhelmingly against proposal, but Catalan government will go ahead with 9 November vote</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"18","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396969490091/Catalan-President-Artur-M-006.jpg","wordcount":"501","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"434030887","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8899973","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ashifa Kassam in Madrid","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2073640","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-11T15:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/spain-set-to-reject-catalonia-indpendence-referendum","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/apr/08/spain-set-to-reject-catalonia-indpendence-referendum","tags":[{"id":"world/catalonia","webTitle":"Catalonia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catalonia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catalonia","references":[]},{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ashifa-kassam","webTitle":"Ashifa Kassam","r2ContributorId":"59856","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ashifa-kassam","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ashifa-kassam","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-434069586","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396969483566/Catalan-President-Artur-M-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Gustau Nacarino","altText":"Catalan President Artur Mas","suppliersReference":"BAR04","height":"54","credit":"Gustau Nacarino/Reuters","caption":"The Catalan president, Artur Mas, will not attend the debate in Spain's parliament.

With the total adjustment looking set to hit €40bn euros, cuts in other places will be deep. Proper details were to be given on Saturday when the budget is taken to parliament.</p><p>Budget minister Cristobal Montoro insisted Spain was on target to meet its 6.3% GDP deficit target this year, with tax income due to hit targets despite the worsening recession.</p><p>Ministers gave no clues as to how close Spain was to asking for a full bailout, with finance minister Luis de Guindos saying that it was studying the terms closely and would decide when it was ready.</p><p>As Spain's borrowing costs began to rise again this week there was growing pressure on prime minister Mariano Rajoy to make the bailout request, which would allow the European Central Bank to step in and buy bonds to keep down the interest rates that Spain must pay.</p><p>While northern eurozone countries continue to insist on more austerity for Spain, analysts warned that this would further damage an economy that will shrink between 2% and 3% over two years.</p><p>\"Given the severity of the recession and the scant prospect of meaningful growth, Spain needs more austerity like it needs a hole in the head,\" warned Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. \"The markets are also in two minds about fiscal retrenchment in Spain. Previous rounds of belt-tightening have not led to an improvement in Spain's perceived creditworthiness.\"</p><p>\"Efforts to deflate Spain into competitiveness raise the prospect of many years of wage cuts and property price falls that will necessitate ever larger fiscal transfers from the stronger countries,\" added Trevor Greetham of Fidelity Worldwide Investment.</p><p>On Friday  the government will reveal the full size of a hole in the Spanish banking sector caused by toxic real estate assets left over from a burst housing bubble.</p><p>Some 56% of the Spanish banking sector will get a thumbs up from the consultants called in to calculate the size of the hole, according to El País newspaper.</p><p>Santander, BBVA, Caixabank, Sabadell and several other medium-sized and small banks pass the test, it reported. Most others, led by bailed out Bankia, will have to ask for money from the €100bn credit line that the eurozone has offered via Spain's bank bailout fund.</p><p>Meanwhile, Greece's fragile coalition yesterday agreed on the main points of a controversial €11.9bn (£9.5bn) austerity package that the debt-stricken country's creditors have set as a condition for further rescue funds. Conservative prime minister Antonis Samaras clinched the consensus of his two left-wing coalition partners, who had both balked at imposing further belt-tightening. But the package, which must be put to international lenders for approval next week and then be voted through Athens' 300-seat parliament, comes with conditions.</p><p><strong>Helena Smith Athens</strong></p>","headline":"Spain heads towards confrontation with Catalan parliament","trailText":"<p>Spain's deputy prime minister says government will resist any attempt at unilateral referendum on independence</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"28","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/27/1348771013419/Luis-de-Guindos-005.jpg","wordcount":"728","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"396809872","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6717597","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Tremlett in Madrid","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-09-28T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1807445","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-09-30T18:38:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/spain-heads-towards-confrontation-catalan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/27/spain-heads-towards-confrontation-catalan","tags":[{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/euro","webTitle":"Euro","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/euro","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/euro","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/greece","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilestremlett","webTitle":"Giles Tremlett","rcsId":"GNL455063","r2ContributorId":"15670","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/giles_tremlett_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Tremlett is a contributing editor to the Guardian and Madrid correspondent for the Economist.

It wouldn't make sense if, because of some rigid norms, it was unable to adapt to changing realities.\"</p><p>His comments came after the European commission president, José Manuel Barroso, indicated this week that any new state would have to apply to join the EU.</p><p>Mas said there would be no looking back for Catalonia after the march, which police said was attended by 1.5 million people – a fifth of the population of the north-eastern region. He also warned the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and his conservative People's party (PP) government that they would be foolish to try to ignore the apparent desire for greater autonomy.</p><p>\"This was not a sudden summer fever,\" he said. \"In Barcelona there was a vast, peaceful multitude of people … The biggest possible mistake would be to minimise what is happening.</p><p>\"It was very important both quantitatively and qualitatively. The feeling was that Catalonia cannot continue on the current path, that it needs its own project.\"</p><p>His words came as the state television company, TVE, apologised for relegating the demonstration to fifth place in its evening news, a move that underlined the growing disconnection between Madrid and Barcelona. \"This news item was poorly placed on the evening news,\" a spokesman admitted. \"That was an error.\"</p><p>Mas, from the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, suggested that independence was not the only solution. Many members of his regional government were at the march and his party is often accused of calculated ambiguity on the matter.</p><p>\"I identify with the popular outcry,\" he said, adding that only his responsibilities as regional prime minister had prevented him from joining the demonstrators. \"Catalonia needs a state,\" he added. \"For years we thought it could be the Spanish state.\"</p><p>But just as northern Europe was getting fed up with the south, and vice versa, so Catalonia and the rest of Spain were now fed up with one another, Mas said.</p><p>He implied that one way for Rajoy to dampen the surge in separatist feeling would be to agree to a change in funding, allowing Spain's wealthiest region to hold on to more of the tax it generates.</p><p>Catalonia wants to be able to collect its own taxes and send a share to Madrid, rather than the other way around. That would make it different from most of Spain's other 16 regional government, but similar to the northern Basque country.</p><p>Mas will see Rajoy next week to discuss what he called an issue of \"fiscal sovereignty\". Popular outrage at Catalan money going elsewhere amid health and education cuts was fuelling the thirst for independence, he suggested.</p><p>Mas said that whatever changes came after this week's demonstration, Catalans wanted to stay in the EU and the euro. \"We haven't gone mad,\" he said.</p><p>Catalonia enjoys a high degree of self-government, running health, education and local policing, but allowing it to form a separate state would be both extremely difficult and potentially explosive. A legal separation would require a change in the Spanish constitution and approval by voters in other parts of the country in a referendum – which seems unlikely.</p><p>\"Unilateral secession does not fit in Spain's constitutional framework,\" foreign minister José Manuel Garcia-Margallo declared on Thursday. \"A declaration of independence by a region does not fit.\"</p><p>Officials in Brussels have also said that Catalonia would automatically leave the EU, and might have to abandon the euro and print its own currency.</p><p>\"A new state, if it wants to join the European Union, has to apply to become a member like any state,\" Barroso said this week. \"And all the other member states have to give their consent.\"</p><p>Garcia-Margallo warned that Catalonia or any other Spanish region that achieved independence would find itself at \"the back of the queue\" for joining the EU.</p><p>The independence demonstration sets a further challenge for Rajoy as he copes with 25% unemployment and a double-dip recession, and decides whether to request a bailout by the European Central Bank and fellow eurozone countries.</p><p>\"Catalonia has serious deficit and employment problems and this is not the moment for messing around,\" Rajoy said before the demonstration.</p><p>Mas's government has launched several austerity programmes as it struggles to bring down its deficit, and ratings agencies give its debt junk status.</p><p>Economists doubt it will hit deficit targets set by the central government this year, however, and Rajoy's government – which is keen to persuade fellow eurozone countries it can control overspending regional governments – has threatened to intervene and take direct control of regional finances where that happens.</p><p>Mas has threatened to call elections if that is done in Catalonia, believing it would provoke a wave of nationalist sentiment. Catalans pay between ¤12bn and ¤16bn more in taxes each year to Madrid than they receive back, with the excess going to poorer regions such as Andalusia and Extremadura.</p>","headline":"Catalonia warns EU that million-strong march cannot be ignored","trailText":"<p>Leader of Spain's wealthiest region suggests separatist feeling could be dampened if Catalonia kept more of its taxes</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347562021416/Catalan-regional-leader-A-005.jpg","wordcount":"839","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"396126487","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6662133","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Tremlett in Madrid","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-09-14T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1801174","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-09-16T19:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/catalonia-million-march","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/13/catalonia-million-march","tags":[{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"world/euro","webTitle":"Euro","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/euro","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/euro","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/debt-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilestremlett","webTitle":"Giles Tremlett","rcsId":"GNL455063","r2ContributorId":"15670","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/giles_tremlett_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Tremlett is a contributing editor to the Guardian and Madrid correspondent for the Economist.

The arguments it used were steeped in the ideology of romanticism: Catalonia was a \"nation\" differentiated from Spain for reasons of language, culture, history, collective character and so on. These factors, whether real or not, convinced only part – a large part, that is, but not the majority – of the Catalan population. The years of regional autonomy showed that nationalism in these terms had reached its limits.</p><p></p><p>In view of this state of affairs, the nationalist parties opened up to another brand of nationalism: economic nationalism, whose support base has been gradually expanding. This new nationalism contends that the <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012/09/28/as-spain-sinks-many-in-catalonia-want-out/57848100/1\" title=\"\">Catalan autonomous government is financially discriminated against</a> by the majority of the other autonomous regions, and that the Spanish national government isn't spending enough money on Catalonia.</p><p></p><p>Many Catalan and other economists have pointed out the inconsistency of this approach, yet it is an opinion that has still gained currency among much of Catalan society. The slogan <a href=\"http://politica.e-noticies.es/espana-nos-roba-la-cartera-segun-los-jovenes-de-ciu-46722.html\" title=\"\"><em>España nos roba</em></a> (\"Spain is robbing us\"), akin to the <em>Roma ladrona</em> (\"Rome the robber\") slogan of Italy's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord\" title=\"\">Lega Nord</a>, or Northern League, has had an effect, and the independence movement has doubled its percentage of adherents among the electorate (increasing, according to opinion polls, from 15-20% to 30-40%), and many Catalans feel that belonging to Spain nowadays is a raw deal.</p><p></p><p>So Catalan nationalism has gained a wider following, adding economic considerations to its traditional cultural identity-based rationale. These economic aspirations can only be satisfied with a different system of funding that is more favourable to Catalonia than to the other autonomous regions – which of course is unacceptable to the latter. So economic nationalist strategies logically call for separation from Spain.</p><p></p><p>The identity-based rationale is incontrovertible. If you believe in the principle of autonomous regions and if you think the fact of Catalonia's being a people tallies with it having a state of its own, separation from Spain follows naturally – although, if it is to be a democratic process, it should consider whether it meets with a widespread consensus and does not cause civil strife. That said, economic nationalism – which is not based on metaphysical essences or subjective emotions, but on empirically verifiable figures and which therefore must carry conviction by means of rational arguments – does not hold up to scrutiny, for the costs thereof are greater than the benefits.</p><p></p><p>This approach is based on the supposedly disproportionate fiscal imbalance calculated according to the cash-flow method, ie establishing the disparity between what Catalonia contributes to the state through tax revenue and what it receives from the state in the way of funding and direct spending. According to this method, Catalonia is losing the equivalent of 8.5% of its GDP per annum. If this amount of money were to stay in Catalonia, say the independentistas, the annual savings would be enormous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Many renowned economists reject the major premise and feel this imbalance is commensurate with the fact that Catalonia happens to be a wealthy region. Madrid and the Balearic Islands are subject to an even greater fiscal imbalance. But the economic damage to Catalonia becomes clear if we deduct from this saving in tax revenue the costs of independence. After independence, the cost of services currently provided by the national government would have to be added to current public spending by the Catalan autonomous government. According to the latter, those services amount to 2.7% of GDP (which already scales the savings down to 5.8%), while some distinguished economists put the figure at 4.3% (yielding savings of only 4.2%).</p><p></p><p>Above all, however, independence would cause huge changes that would weaken the whole Catalan economy. First and foremost, Catalonia would remain outside the EU for the time being and for a few years to come. That would have devastating effects: first, on its relations with the rest of Spain (which accounts for considerably more than half of its usual trade) and also on tariffs with all the EU countries, the relocation of businesses, and disinvestment. All of that would diminish Catalan tax revenue and increase unemployment. Moreover, to the current Catalan public debt – the biggest in Spain by far – would have to be added the share of Spanish debt attributable to Catalonia in the division of assets according to international law. All that would produce an economic crisis that would last for many years, and the region that emerges from that crisis would not be the one we know now, but a much poorer Catalonia.</p><p></p><p>So is an independent Catalonia viable in economic terms? As a theoretical model, yes, given its size and productive volume. Nonetheless, in the current context, considered in dynamic terms, independence would be pure suicide. Only after many years of hardship and struggle would Catalonia regain its current economic level. But in the long run, as Keynes put it, we're all dead. Some people are apparently eager to die for their fatherland instead of contributing to its wellbeing.</p><p>• This article was commissioned by La Vanguardia for the Guardian and translated by Eric Rosencrantz</p>","headline":"The economics of Catalan independence don't add up","trailText":"<strong>Francesc de Carreras for La Vanguardia:</strong> The economic argument for nationalism seems persuasive, yet Catalonia's wealth would be offset by the cost of independence","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/22/1353589619029/Spain---2009-005.jpg","wordcount":"853","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"399855491","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6934457","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Francesc de Carreras for La Vanguardia","internalPageCode":"1832504","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-25T14:15:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/22/economics-catalan-independence-dont-add-up","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/22/economics-catalan-independence-dont-add-up","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/catalonia","webTitle":"Catalonia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catalonia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catalonia","references":[]},{"id":"world/series/barca-loners-will-breakaway-catalonia-fracture-spain","webTitle":"Barça-loners: Will breakaway Catalonia fracture Spain?","description":"In Barça-loners, the Guardian in conjunction with the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia examine the quest for a separate Catalan state, the costs and benefits, the impact of the financial crisis and the origins and implications of this historical faultline running through northeastern Spain","type":"series","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/barca-loners-will-breakaway-catalonia-fracture-spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/series/barca-loners-will-breakaway-catalonia-fracture-spain","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/francesc-de-carreras","webTitle":"Francesc de Carreras","r2ContributorId":"54021","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/22/1353600349492/Francesc_de_Carreras.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Francesc de Carreras is professor of constitutional law at the Autonomous University of Barcelona</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/francesc-de-carreras","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/francesc-de-carreras","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-399858538","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/22/1353589615224/Spain---2009-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Kevin Foy / Rex Features","photographer":"Kevin Foy / Rex Features","altText":"Spain -

Meanwhile, Barcelona-based daily La Vanguardia forecast the conservative party would garner 62-64 legislators in the assembly, compared with the 68 they would need to govern without the support of six other parties expected to win seats.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/18/catalan-messiah-artur-mas\" title=\"\">Mas, who has led a minority government for two years</a>, called for early elections and a referendum after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-rally-barcelona\" title=\"\">an independence rally in the regional capital Barcelona on 11 September drew an estimated 1.5 million people</a>, equivalent to about one in five of the north-eastern region's inhabitants.</p><p>A recent survey by Catalan government-funded research group CEO predicts 57% of Catalans would vote to break away from Spain. However, the central government has said a referendum in the rich but indebted region would be unconstitutional, and the constitutional court in Madrid blocked a move to hold a similar vote in the northern Basque country as recently as 2008.</p><p>Another potential stumbling block for a separation has been raised by doubts over whether an independent Catalonia could remain in the European Union. When asked on Saturday at the Iberoamerican summit held in Cádiz, European commission president José Manuel Barroso replied that the bloc would stand by rules drawn up in 2004, ie states that secede would have to apply for membership.</p><p>\"The legal situation has not changed since 2004. The Lisbon treaty has not introduced any modifications in that respect,\" he said.</p><p>Catalonia has a distinct language and culture and, like all of Spain's 17 regions, enjoys considerable autonomy, but the CiU is demanding the right to collect its own taxes and send a share to Madrid, an arrangement similar to the Basque country.</p><p>Less at the forefront of the campaign has been the deep spending cuts which have sparked massive protests across crisis-hit Spain. Mas's government had to ask Madrid for a €5bn bailout in August for Catalonia, which is Spain's wealthiest region and accounts for 18.5% of Spain's total economic output, but also for 29% of all outstanding debt held by the country's regions.</p>","headline":"Catalan leader will fall short of majority to press for independence, polls say","trailText":"Key Spanish media predict next Sunday's regional elections will leave Artur Mas's party without mandate to hold referendum","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/18/1353244461071/Artur-Mas-leader-of-Catal-005.jpg","wordcount":"398","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"399597124","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6918039","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Roberts in Madrid","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-19T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1830463","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-21T13:15:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/18/catalan-short-of-majority-independence","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/18/catalan-short-of-majority-independence","tags":[{"id":"world/catalonia","webTitle":"Catalonia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catalonia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catalonia","references":[]},{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-roberts","webTitle":"Martin Roberts","r2ContributorId":"53913","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-roberts","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/martin-roberts","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-399597324","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/18/1353244457479/Artur-Mas-leader-of-Catal-002.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Quique Garcia","altText":"Artur Mas, leader of Catalonia's regional government","suppliersReference":"515429947","height":"54","credit":"Quique Garcia/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Artur Mas, leader of Catalonia's regional government, called for early elections and a referendum after an independence rally in Barcelona drew an estimate 1.5 million people.
