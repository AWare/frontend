Practically overnight, Westminster’s most vivid characters – from the Notting Hill set to Nigel Farage – vanished. One of the few recognisable names still left on Labour’s front bench is Tom Watson, whose charismatic reputation and geeky glamour should therefore elevate him to celebrity status in this colourless new political landscape. But ever since the early hours of 24 June, Labour’s deputy leader has retreated behind a blank facial glaze so opaque as to render him completely inscrutable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Trotskyists 'twisting arms' of young Labour members to back Corbyn, Watson says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When appearing beside Jeremy Corbyn, he wears an expression normally reserved for funerals, which of course only makes me all the more curious to know what he is thinking. I ask about his thoughts while he watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-first-pmq-prime-minister-questions-panel\">Theresa May demolish Corbyn at her first prime minister’s questions</a>, and he starts to chuckle.</p> <p>“Well, at PMQs I always try to get myself into a Buddha-like state. I try not to have any facial expression at all. Because if I laugh at a Jeremy joke, two hours later on social media it’s either interpreted as me laughing at Jeremy, or laughing at an opposition joke. Or, if I scowl at something someone says, people are accusing me of scowling at Jeremy. So I try to keep a straight face, which everyone always interprets as me looking really sad and miserable. That’s actually not the case. I’m generally just trying to remain expressionless.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f/0_29_1746_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson does a good job at keeping it up for most of this interview, too. When we speak before the high court ruling on Labour’s leadership contest, the detached serenity he affects is disconcertingly implausible. But, as he points out several times, he will have to serve as deputy to whichever leader his party elects. “I’m 50 next year, so I’ve learned not to worry about the things you’ve got no control of. I’ve not really been in control of events in the last few weeks, and if I can’t control events, I can’t worry about them.”</p> <p>He certainly did not predict them. Watson had no idea that Labour’s leader would call for article 50 to be triggered at once, within hours of the referendum result. “But if I’m being honest, I’d not focused a lot on the plan B in the planning meetings that I’d had with him.”</p> <p>Failing to anticipate the impact Corbyn’s words would have on Labour MPs – “At that point I was so exhausted, I didn’t take it in on the Friday” – he made his way to Glastonbury.</p> <p>Watson was offline <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-enforcer-tom-watson-filmed-8284779\">in a silent disco</a> when Corbyn sacked Hilary Benn late that Saturday night, and remained blissfully unaware of the unfolding crisis until he awoke the next morning to a “whole load of missed calls and texts”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1/0_102_625_870/359.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Watson/Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Laura_K_Hughes/status/746992729100541952?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">spent the day on the phone</a>, hurrying back to London, “trying to find out what was happening”. Remarkably, he didn’t speak to Corbyn. Did he even try? “I can’t remember, actually,” he offers vaguely. I’m not sure which would be more bizarre: Corbyn refusing to take his deputy’s call, or Watson not even bothering to phone. When they met the next day, “As ever with Jeremy, it was business-like and friendly.” Watson told him the resignations could have been prevented, had Corbyn only reached out to his shadow team and addressed their concerns. Corbyn disagreed, convinced it was a premeditated coup. “He didn’t seem angry. Just puzzled and sorrowful.”</p> <p>When Watson heard that a no-confidence motion had been tabled, “I didn’t pay it much heed. I thought it wouldn’t have legs.” He won’t say which way he voted, but the result came as a shock. Even then, it didn’t occur to him that Corbyn would defy the PLP’s indictment. “I thought he would realise that to lose the confidence of 80% of your MPs means that you can’t lead the Labour party.” Watson tried to say so in private two days later, but was thwarted when two Corbyn aides made an unscheduled appearance in their car.</p> <p>“I was told we would have the journey on our own, and they came. I did suggest that they didn’t, and they said we’re coming in the car. So it became very difficult to have the conversation.” Was he angry? Watson looks conflicted. “You know, at any point in time I want to put my arms around him and hug him and say it’s going to be all right, but also sort of shout and say, we need to talk about this. So I was actually feeling great sorrow for him.”</p> <p>It wasn’t until six days after the no-confidence vote that Watson met Corbyn privately. “It was very sad, really. But it was also, as ever, polite. I said, I don’t think you can lead the Labour party if you’ve lost 80% of your MPs, and he said, well, look, you’ve said what you have to say, and thank you for saying it. I think he actually said, thank you for saying it in such a polite way. It was still friendly. I did my duty. I did what I could. What else can you do?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9/0_138_4864_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He answers his own question minutes later, after protestations of reluctance that may or not be genuine. His plans “are at a nascent stage”, he says several times, “and I probably shouldn’t even begin to talk to Decca Aitkenhead of the Guardian about them”. But he does.</p> <p>Watson wants to reverse Ed Miliband’s “terrible error of judgment” and reinstate the old electoral college system, which accorded one-third of the votes in a leadership election to the PLP and a third each to the unions and the members. He is also drawing up proposals for an agreement “to have women holding some of the key offices of state. My personal view is if you don’t give a proper gender representation on the frontbench you’re in trouble, and either Owen or Jeremy will have to make sure that those big offices have women in them.”</p> <p>Most significantly, Watson wants to reintroduce elections to the shadow cabinet. Is he sure that MPs who resigned, or refused to serve under Corbyn, would reconsider if elected by the PLP? “I have no idea. But I think if Owen wins it’s still important to do it, because a new leader has got to reshape and rebuild the PLP, and that means giving respect and dignity back to a lot of colleagues.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db/0_290_5672_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much time he will have to effect any of this is uncertain, if Watson is right about his next point. “I think it’s highly likely there’ll be an early election. I mean, if you’re Theresa May, with a majority of 12, with your Brexit fanatics already saying you’re not going quickly enough to get us out of the European Union, with having sacked too many people from the frontbench who are just looking for the opportunity for her to stumble, and with a double-digit lead in the polls, then even though on day one you might not think you’re going to have an early election, I think it’s almost inevitable you’ll get to a point where you have to. If you were Theresa May, why wouldn’t you? Honestly, why wouldn’t you? You’d get your own mandate, you’d have the easiest run at the election you could imagine, and in all likelihood you’d come back with a bigger majority. Why wouldn’t you do that?”</p> <p>Could whoever wins the leadership election survive a defeat in a general election? “Well, I don’t know. I don’t know. I mean, it’s highly unlikely, isn’t it? Most leaders resign after losing an election.” Most leaders, I point out, resign after losing the confidence of 80% of MPs. “Well, yes. So it’s still possible, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Watson is conspicuously reluctant to apportion blame for the crisis facing Labour, but when pressed, he acknowledges, “There are Trots that have come back to the party, and they certainly don’t have the best interests of the Labour party at heart. They see the Labour party as a vehicle for revolutionary socialism, and they’re not remotely interested in winning elections, and that’s a problem. But I don’t think the vast majority of people that have joined the Labour party and have been mobilised by the people that are in Momentum are all Trots and Bolsheviks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505/0_25_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Some months ago, I described Momentum as ‘a bit of a rabble’, and although leading lights in Momentum privately acknowledged to me that they were a bit of a rabble, it caused great offence to everyone that had signed up to Momentum. Some of these people are deeply interested in political change, in building a more equal society, and are just on a journey in politics that they’re new to, and I don’t want them to feel that I’m labelling them because I’m not. But there are some old hands twisting young arms in this process, and I’m under no illusions about what’s going on. They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that’s how Trotsky entryists operate. Sooner or later, that always end up in disaster. It always ends up destroying the institutions that are vulnerable, unless you deal with it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/tom-watson-the-canny-peacemaker-combatting-conspiracy-theorists\">Tom Watson: the canny peacemaker combatting conspiracy theorists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What can Watson say to Guardian readers angry with him for betraying the mandate party members invested in him to serve as a loyal deputy to the leader they elected? By asking Corbyn to stand down, didn’t Watson serve the will of self-important MPs instead?</p> <p>“I don’t think many Guardian readers would think that. I hope most Guardian readers would have a modicum of sympathy for the situation I find myself in. I don’t want us to be here. I don’t want us to be in this position. I didn’t want Hilary to be sacked. I didn’t want there to be a whole set of resignations. I didn’t want us to be 16 points behind in the polls. I didn’t want any of this. I’m not in control of events, but I’m doing what I can.”</p> <p>He is adamant that the party will not split in the event of Corbyn’s re-election. “I don’t know of any MPs who think the party should split, and frankly I think the claim that there’s a plan out there to split the party is propaganda which actually undermines a lot of people in the PLP. Every single person I talk to on the left and right of the party thinks this is a bad idea. I’ve not had anyone muse with me about it. I’ve not had anyone gossip with me about it. I’ve not heard anyone raising it as an issue.”</p> <p>Watson remains in contact with Corbyn, though it sounds rather semi-detached. “We still send the odd text to each other. It’s usually about family stuff, you know. My dad’s ill, and he’s always asking about my dad. My dad’s a big supporter of Jeremy. It’s a sort of chat really.”</p> <p>Such is Watson’s reputation as master of dark arts, some observers have speculated that behind the careful facade of neutrality he is issuing coded messages via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson\">his Twitter feed</a>. In recent weeks, it has become increasingly eccentric, featuring links to months’ old articles, such as one headlined: “Why Bad Ideas Refuse to Die.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/762775167445692418\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s world cat day.

I’m certainly not trying to send a secret signal through the medium of Twitter.”</p> <p>Does he still feel, I ask, like Labour’s arch-fixer?</p> <p>“Well, I’ve not done very well at it,” he laughs. “I know I’ve got a reputation for being a fixer. I know it’s my label. But the truth is, I’ve never been a very good fixer. And I couldn’t fix this.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"2073","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T11:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T15:08:38Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T11:30:44Z","internalComposerCode":"57a8a076e4b0f5d064841819","internalOctopusCode":"11790953","internalPageCode":"2639891","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T23:26:20Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

says</a></figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Owen Smith, the Labour leadership challenger, sparked controversy on Wednesday by suggesting a British government would have to negotiate with Isis to end the conflict in the Middle East.</p> <p>Asked in a televised debate whether the terrorist group, which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria and has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in the west, should be allowed to join talks about resolving the conflicts in the Middle East, Smith said “all actors” should be involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/17/third-labour-leadership-debate-live-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-victoria-derbyshire\">Owen Smith suggests Islamic State needs to 'get round the table' – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By contrast, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has sometimes been accused of being too willing to associate himself with extremist groups, said Isis should not be allowed to take part in talks. “No, they are not going to be round the table, no.” Later a spokesman for Corbyn criticised Smith’s remarks as “hasty and ill-considered”.<br /></p> <p>Smith, who was a special adviser to Paul Murphy, Northern Ireland secretary in Tony Blair’s government, said: “I worked on the Northern Ireland peace process for three years; I was part of the UK’s negotiating team that helped bring together the loyalist paramilitaries.</p> <p>“My view is that, ultimately, all solutions to these international crises do come about through dialogue, so eventually if we are to try to solve this all of the actors do need to be involved. But at the moment Isil [Isis] are clearly not interested in negotiating. At some point for us to resolve this, we will need to get people round the table.”</p> <p>He later clarified the remarks in a Facebook Q&amp;A, saying Isis would have to “renounce violence, cease all acts of terror and commit themselves to a peaceful settlement”, before any talks could take place.</p> <p>But his comments were seized on by the Conservatives, with Johnny Mercer, the MP and member of the defence select committee, saying: “His desperate attempts to out-Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn have led him to the view that barbaric murderers who behead journalists and lynch homosexuals are now the sort of people that we should negotiate with.</p> <p>“It shows that whoever wins this increasingly bizarre leadership election, I’m afraid Labour just cannot be trusted with keeping us safe.”</p> <p>Corbyn has previously suggested a back-channel to Isis should be maintained as part of efforts to resolve the Syria crisis.</p> <p>“The British government maintained a channel to the IRA all through the Troubles,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in January. “I don’t condemn them for that. I don’t condemn them for keeping a back-channel to the Taliban.</p> <p>But a spokesman for Corbyn’s campaign said : “Jeremy has always argued that there must be a negotiated political solution to the war in Syria and the wider Middle East, and that maintaining lines of communication during conflicts is essential. But Isis cannot be part of those negotiations. Instead, its sources of funding and supplies must be cut off.”</p> <p>Smith, the MP for Pontypridd and former shadow work and pensions secretary, announced that he would challenge Corbyn after the Labour leader was hit by a series of resignations from his shadow cabinet, and lost the confidence of 172 of his MPs.</p> <p>The battle for the future of Labour has become increasingly ill-tempered, with the deputy leader, Tom Watson, claiming last week that Corbyn’s leadership has encouraged hard left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">“Trotsky entryists” to seek to infiltrate the party</a>.</p> <p>Smith and Corbyn locked horns repeatedly in Wednesday’s two-hour-long debate, clashing over Smith’s claims that the Labour leader has failed to do enough to crack down on bullying and antisemitism.</p> <p>One young party member in the audience, Francesca, said she had witnessed intimidating behaviour at a recent Labour youth meeting, and suggested she would feel safer as a Labour supporter at a Tory conference than a non-Corbyn supporter at a Labour conference.</p> <p>Victoria Derbyshire, who hosted the debate on the BBC News channel, suggested the atmosphere in the Labour party had become “toxic”; but Corbyn shot back: “Well how do you know?”</p> <p>He added: “I attend large amounts of events all over the country where there are people of all shades of opinion having a respectful and intelligent debate; that’s how we should do things at all time.”</p> <p>Europe marked another dividing line, with Smith repeating his promise to offer the electorate a choice about whether to accept whatever Brexit deal Britain managed to negotiate, with a second referendum or a general election. He described the decision to leave the EU as “a desperate mistake for our country”.</p> <p>Student fees were another area of contention, with Corbyn saying he would scrap them, while Smith would fund university education through a graduate tax.</p> <p></p> <p>Britain’s nuclear deterrent was another issue over which the pair set out differing positions, with Corbyn saying he would arm the Trident submarines with conventional weapons instead of nuclear warheads, while Smith said he believed in multilateral disarmament.</p> <p>Smith said he had been a unilateralist in the past, saying: “I used to hold that view, I don’t any longer. I think we should negotiate our way to get rid of nuclear weapons. The country wants the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party to be serious about the security of our country.” </p> <p>Corbyn, by contrast, described nuclear weapons as, “unconscionable”.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"7","wordcount":"867","creationDate":"2016-08-17T09:57:45Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-17T10:32:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57b43519e4b062ce4d224297","internalOctopusCode":"11821394","internalPageCode":"2662480","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T21:00:57Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Corbyn said negotiations should involve the Assad government and others in “proximity talks”. He said Islamic State “shouldn’t be round the table, no”.</p> <p>Smith went much further. He said: “At some point, for us to resolve this, we will need to get people round the table.”</p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>Corbyn said he would fight against any consequences Brexit would have for workers’ rights, environmental protection and access to the market for British industry, but stopped short of saying Labour should work to prevent Brexit.</p> <p>Smith says Brexit is “a desperate mistake for our country” and said he would keep making the argument for EU membership.</p> <h2>Student fees</h2> <p>This was a key policy difference that emerged between the two. Smith said he was against fees but favoured a graduate tax as a way of funding universities.</p> <p>Corbyn said he was opposed to both, and said he would scrap fees and increase public funding of universities via higher corporation taxation.</p> <h2>Economy </h2> <p>Corbyn’s spending plans were vaguer than Smith’s but the debate saw the former work and pensions secretary acknowledge borrowing would increase and the deficit rise for his proposed £200bn infrastructure investment, using long-term loans. He also said tax changes would lead to increased revenue of £13bn.</p> <p>Asked about his spending and borrowing plans, Corbyn cites his policies of the national investment bank and transport policies which he said would help grow the economy, as well as tax rises. But he was unable to say what extent of economic growth would be required to fully fund his proposals.</p> <p>Handing over now to my colleague Haroon Siddique who will take you through the political reaction into the afternoon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:54:03.646Z\">at 11.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b436e9e4b0178756b5d79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:06:18.250Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It’s been a lively debate but I think this – as close as Corbyn gets to an angry voice – is one of the best bits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jeremy Corbyn telling Owen Smith to be quiet is my new jam <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VictoriaLIVE?src=hash\">#VictoriaLIVE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw\">https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw</a></p>&mdash; Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">August 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:11:17.568Z\">at 11.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b434cce4b062ce4d224296\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:59:40.812Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The debate is over now and large swaths of the undecided section of the audience have moved over to support Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>One said it was Corbyn’s commitment to community activism that persuaded him and another by his arguments on child mental health which he stated at the end of the programme.</p> <p>Another, remaining in the middle, says she is still genuinely unconvinced, and has decided she will abstain. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:01:03.758Z\">at 11.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b43429e4b062ce4d224291\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:56:20.600Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smith’s comments on Islamic State are creating a bit of a stir on social media.

The Labour leadership hustings are beginning to feel a bit like that. Slowly dawning horror and that weird kind of embarrassment that comes from watching someone do things they will, definitely, regret later.</p> <p>Each hustings heaps on the misery. The BBC show this morning, dwelling on internal arguments for almost the whole of the first hour, was a bleak illustration of how angry and nasty people get when they are positively encouraged to be, you know, nasty and angry. It was like a couples counselling session where the partners were instructed to say what they really think and don’t worry about the consequences.</p> <p>No wonder one young woman said she’d rather tell a Tory conference she was Labour than a Labour conference she was an Owen Smith supporter. Unfortunately, that’s an entry level lesson in politics: arguments with your own side are infinitely more wounding than fights with the enemy. </p> <p>But pretending there isn’t a row doesn’t help either. Smith is smart enough, surely, to realise that telling one great big porky (there is no rift between the MPs and the membership) makes everyone look a bit sideways at everything else you assert. It didn’t help that he knew who Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber were. Each tiny success made him that bit less appealing than Jeremy Corbyn. Failing to recognise Ant and Dec ought to make Corbyn look a tiny bit less ordinary than he pretends, but instead it becomes just another aspect of his virtue.</p> <p>This is the impossibility of this dystopian contest. Everything Smith says sounds a bit like the clever kid at the front of the class giving the right answer. Everything Corbyn says, even the grotesque populism of his claim to be unable to say whether he preferred Leon Trotsky or the man who won Labour three elections, brought peace to Northern Ireland, introduced the Human Rights Act and the minimum wage and almost doubled spending on the NHS, Tony Blair – even this gobsmacking piece of juvenilia just slicks another impenetrable layer of authenticity that is a Teflon coating against all rational criticism.</p> <p>Poor Owen Smith. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28zKZPnK_Tg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/28zKZPnK_Tg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-wearing\">David Wearing</a>: Ant, Dec and football – but little policy discussion</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8886305ab74f487951c24e50255a44f356f6fcf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8886305ab74f487951c24e50255a44f356f6fcf2/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"David Wearing\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Putting it as gently as possible, the BBC did not quite cover itself in glory in its role as a public service broadcaster this morning. Over an hour and 20 minutes of a two-hour programme had elapsed before the discussion turned to substantive issues of policy. First we learned that Owen Smith couldn’t remember the score from the Wales v Belgium match in June, and that Jeremy Corbyn couldn’t recognise a photo of Ant and Dec. Fascinating stuff, no doubt, to a nation experiencing a decade-long squeeze in living standards, and a deeply uncertain economic future.</p> <p>There was much discussion of the divisions within Labour, but barely any serious exploration of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives\">the political basis for those divisions</a> actually is. The section of the debate devoted to the issue of abuse within the party generated more heat than light. Labour members in the audience were clear that abuse had flown in both directions, but Smith was determined to make the mud stick to Corbyn alone. The opportunity could have been taken to debate the substance of the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/party-documents/ChakrabartiInquiry.pdf\">Shami Chakrabarti report</a>, but instead there was cheap innuendo about the integrity of a woman who has been Britain’s leading civil liberties advocate over the past 13 years. None of this was particularly constructive.</p> <p>The mere 35 minutes devoted to policy rendered what discussion there was largely superficial. There was one fascinating moment when Smith appeared to advocate talking to Isis, which Corbyn sensibly had ruled out, but the significance of this was missed, and the debate moved on. </p> <p>By the end BBC viewers could have been forgiven for wondering why the press and leading Labour figures have spent so much of the past week talking about Trotskyism. There were no calls from Corbyn for the violent overthrow of the state, the abolition of private property or the installation of a communist regime. All the middle-aged guy from Wiltshire appeared to be suggesting was that British capitalism should be run a little less like America’s version, and a little more like Sweden’s. </p> <p>It was the basic reasonableness of his position – in spite of his sometimes maddening failure to give sharper, more focused answers – that saw most of the neutral section of the audience expressing their support for him at the end of the debate.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ayesha-hazarika\">Ayesha Hazarika</a>: Not navel gaze? We’re going for a full political endoscopy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb66b2408190685ec189f0a445409340c2c446ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb66b2408190685ec189f0a445409340c2c446ca/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith are having a gruelling August, hauling themselves from gig to gig playing to difficult, hard to please crowds, getting brutal reviews and by this point, even they must be bored of their own material. Today’s debate was hard work for everyone, but especially the viewer. </p> <p>Most of the two-hour extravaganza was spent talking about infighting with a small amount of policy discussion and then went back to both sides taking lumps out of each other and trading tales of Twitter trolling. This is not the fault of the show, it’s a reflection of where the Labour party is now. We are a party that laughs in the face of the political cliche: “We must not navel gaze and look inwards.” Get lost. We’re going for a full political endoscopy.</p> <p>Corbyn started off strong and looking as cool as a cucumber. His answer to the question “What do you do in your spare time?” was impressive. He runs, tends his allotment, reads widely, makes stuff (jam I presume) and cycles. If this doesn’t work out he could be a life coach. Smith’s answer was less inspiring as he trotted out his CV and talked about his kids but that’s OK because he knows who Taylor Swift is.</p> <p>The two men traded some blows on handling abuse within the party and Brexit but there didn’t really feel like there was much of an exploration of the big issues. Smith managed to get under Corbyn’s skin a few times and we saw an interesting new Team Corbyn debating manoeuvre which is basically yelling, “How do YOU know?”</p> <p>But we didn’t really learn anything new from the debate. We saw that Smith is a good performer who is concerned with how Labour can get back into power. We saw that Corbyn is popular and he won with the undecideds in the audience. That the current party mood feels members are the most important people in politics. And we saw that the big questions like how are we ever going to make things happen are not really important right now.</p> <p>It’s going to be a long summer.</p>","wordcount":"1171","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-17T18:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-17T09:55:35Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-17T12:09:02Z","internalComposerCode":"57b43497e4b062ce4d224293","internalPageCode":"2662475","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T19:02:16Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v765","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a615639c3c2a8fff56607d408afd885712b7a1fc/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"478","internalShortId":"/p/5v765"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-panel","webTitle":"Did Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith win this hustings?

But you don’t expect to spot the leader of the opposition on the floor of a train on your way to work.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, famed for standing up for his principles, sat down for them last week, along with 20 other seatless commuters on a three-hour train journey from London to Newcastle. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-interview-leadership-plots-nhs-education\">Jeremy Corbyn interview: ‘There are not 300,000 sectarian extremists at large’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a video shot as he was on his way to debate with Owen Smith in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">Labour leadership</a> hustings in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-debate-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-gateshead-live\">Gateshead</a>, Corbyn is seen sitting on the floor of the train, a coffee and brown paper bag at his feet, reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/private-eye\">Private Eye</a>. The freelance filmmaker Yannis Mendez, who has been following Corbyn and volunteers for his campaign, filmed the footage.</p> <p>From his spot on the floor, which he chose rather than upgrading to first class, Corbyn turns to the camera and says: “This is a problem that many passengers face every day, commuters and long-distance travellers. Today this train is completely ram-packed. The staff are absolutely brilliant, working really hard to help everybody.</p> <p>“The reality is there are not enough trains, we need more of them – and they’re also incredibly expensive.” He said the whole experience was a good case for public ownership.</p> <p>Later, Corbyn said: “Is it fair that I should upgrade my ticket whilst others who might not be able to afford such a luxury should have to sit on the floor? It’s their money I would be spending after all.”</p> <p>Ellen, a mother-of-two who travelled on the same train and and also had no seat, said: “It was a surprise to see him there, but it was refreshing. It made me realise that it shouldn’t be a surprise to see a politician travelling alongside average commuters. They should be on the same level as the general public.”</p> <p>It is not the first time Corbyn has experienced the reality of Britain’s transport woes. During the 2015 leadership campaign he was spotted on a night bus after a day’s campaigning:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisBrosnahan/status/627809774126669824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">George Osborne insists on first class seat on a standard class ticket.

Further transport-centred rallies will then take place in the Midlands.<br /></p> <p>The Labour leader will say the ongoing chaotic delays on the route are proof that “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-rmt-union-modernise-ceo-strike\">private transport operators cannot be trusted with having passengers’ best interests at heart</a>”.</p> <p>“Public ownership of our railways is needed now to fix the transport nightmare we are currently faced with, and we know there is overwhelming support among the British public for a people’s railway,” he will say. </p> <p>“It is only by bringing the railways back under public ownership as the contracts expire, that we will fix the rail crisis and I’m pleased that even some Tory politicians are now joining us in calling for Southern rail to immediately be brought under public ownership.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447c8d834e14c703414a25be3c96c29e034d55bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447c8d834e14c703414a25be3c96c29e034d55bf/224_340_2095_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn will set out a series of plans to improve Britain’s bus and rail network.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, has also said he is in favour of renationalising the railways. However, Corbyn will also announce a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies, which he will say will lead to improvements in rural and more socially useful bus routes. </p> <p>Corbyn will say: “Together these plans for the bus and rail network will help us rebuild and transform Britain’s transport system, so that no one and no community is left behind.” </p> <p>The Labour leader’s bus plan is based on research by Transport for Quality of Life, who have estimated local authority bus franchising could generate net financial gains of up to £340m a year if introduced nationwide. A Labour government would use the funds to restore cuts to the bus service operators’ grant, Corbyn’s campaign said. </p> <p>On Monday, Corbyn was revealed to have swept the board of constituency Labour party nominations, winning the support of 285 constituency Labour parties and Smith taking just 53 nominations.</p> <p>Nominations do not have a bearing on the leadership voting process but act as statements of support. Ballot papers will be sent out by post and email next Monday, to be returned by 21 September with a midday deadline. The result will be announced at a special conference on Saturday 24 September in Liverpool.</p>","wordcount":"512","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T23:01:17Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T16:54:56Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T23:01:17Z","internalComposerCode":"57b1f3e0e4b0c23bfed89bec","internalPageCode":"2658145","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-16T12:47:31Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vx7m","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec2e2a774f0cad254dcd036d4d91b7d4cb91c9bd/67_0_1458_875/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"706","internalShortId":"/p/5vx7m"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges","webTitle":"Corbyn to launch transport campaign with rail pledges","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-16T12:47:15Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2660374","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761/0_105_2067_1241/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Jeremy Corbyn","caption":"Jeremy Corbyn meets commuters at London Bridge station during a protest by unions against Southern rail.","credit":"Photograph: Vickie Flores/REX/Shutterstock","photographer":"Vickie Flores","source":"REX/Shutterstock","width":"140","height":"84","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761/0_105_2067_1241/140.jpg","displayCredit":"true","mediaId":"aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761","imageType":"Photograph","suppliersReference":"5829795h","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2016 Rex Features.

There is support here for a different way of doing politics and I hope all my colleagues in parliament will reflect on that and reflect on how we can work together.”</p> <p>Corbyn has spent Tuesday campaigning on transport, meeting commuters at London Bridge station during a protest by unions against the beleaguered Southern rail, followed by campaign rallies in Derby and Matlock. </p> <p>Speaking in Derby, Corbyn he it was the 21st speech of his leadership campaign, which aimed to visit every major city and town in the UK. He renewed his pledge to renationalise the railways, which he said would mean bringing each franchise back into public ownership when it came up for renewal. </p> <p>“The costs of rail travel will be borne by public as a whole and profits will go to the public,” he said. “Profits from the east coast mainline are now going to Virgin. </p> <p>“This campaign is about the election of one person to be leader of the party. But put it this way, it’s a campaign about the kind of country we want to live in and the place we want to play in the world. </p> <p>“Our programme is about social justice, opportunities for all and a sustainable economy, but it is also about how we do our politics. Do we allow an elite to decide what the politics should be, what the policies are … or is it about the participation of the hundreds of thousands who are now part of our party and our movement??”</p> <p>His campaign says passengers could see savings of up to 10%, though critics have said in practice that it would take several years for any savings to trickle down to passengers.</p> <p>Corbyn also announced what his team said was a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies.</p> <p>His leadership rival Owen Smith’s campaign said on Tuesday that the policies the Corbyn campaign had announced were not new. Rail renationalisation was agreed by the last shadow cabinet, and Smith’s campaign also said the proposals on bus networks had been agreed in 2012 when Maria Eagle was transport secretary.</p> <p>“There is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying. He is simply rehashing existing Labour party policy,” a spokesman for the Smith campaign said. “Owen has pledged to go further to improve our rail and bus networks by promising a £200bn ‘British New Deal’ to invest in things like transport services to help get the country moving again.”</p>","wordcount":"652","creationDate":"2016-08-16T14:07:44Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-16T15:28:37Z","internalComposerCode":"57b31e30e4b0178756b5d3ae","internalPageCode":"2660374","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T07:31:01Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v49a","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761/0_105_2067_1241/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"714","internalShortId":"/p/5v49a"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-might-forget-labour-mps-criticisms-if-he-wins-leadership-race-nationalisation-railways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-might-forget-labour-mps-criticisms-if-he-wins-leadership-race-nationalisation-railways","webTitle":"Corbyn

It helps with research, but it can’t make medicines,” he said. “It would be physically impossible for the NHS to be able to trial medicines around the world, so of course we will always rely on external forces, companies essentially, to be able to make medicines.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/15/creeping-privatisation-nhs-official-data-owen-smith-outsourcing\">How much is the government really privatising the NHS?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith’s early campaign has been dogged by accusations that he lobbied for further private sector involvement in the NHS during his time working for pharmaceuticals companies Pfizer and Amgen. At the launch of his campaign in July, Jeremy Corbyn said medical research should not be “farmed out” to big companies such as Pfizer, but should be funded through the Medical Research Council. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, later said that Corbyn’s comments had been misinterpreted, announcing that Labour would seek to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/24/labour-proposes-scrapping-1bn-tax-relief-innovation-patent-box-pharmaceuticals\">reform or scrap a £1bn tax relief</a> designed to promote innovation in companies, including in pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian following Monday’s speech, Smith said: “Medicines have always been developed in the private sector and provided to the NHS. It was frankly a bit silly of Jeremy to say that all medicines should be developed in the NHS.</p> <p>“That’s obviously totally implausible. It would bankrupt the NHS even if it were possible, which of course it isn’t, and he was just using the fact that I’ve worked for big biotech companies as a stick with which to beat me.</p> <p>“Truthfully, it’s useful to have somebody who understands how big companies operate and it’s completely wrong to suggest that that in any way means I’m in favour of private provision. I’ve never been in favour of it.”</p> <p>Asked if he had any criticism of his former employers, Smith said: “Yeah, I think medicines should be cheaper, generally. That’s the key criticism I have. I think medicines should be cheaper across the world.”</p> <p>In his speech, the former shadow work and pensions secretary spoke about the threat of creeping privatisation in the NHS and highlighted Department of Health figures showing that spending on private sector NHS providers had doubled under the Conservatives, from more than £4bn in 2009-10 to £8.7bn in 2015-16. Smith has pledged to increase health spending by 4% a year if he becomes prime minister.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/judges-and-infiltrators-in-labours-civil-war\">Judges and infiltrators in Labour’s civil war | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to an audience of supporters and journalists in Salford, Smith argued that the last Labour government had opened the door for the Tories to introduce an increasing amount of private sector involvement in the health service.</p> <p>“I do think the last Labour government did use private sector providers in order to clear [waiting lists for] hip operations and knee operations and cataracts, and for those individual patients I think that was a worthwhile thing because we inherited – as we will again – massive waiting lists for those key bits of surgery,” he said.</p> <p>“The reality is I think we failed to appreciate the way in which the Tories would use those words and use the fact Labour had relied on some private sector provision as a Trojan horse for what they wanted to do, which was to break up, denationalise and privatise the NHS. I think perhaps we were naive about the extent to which they would usurp those themes and subvert them.</p> <p>“I think we need to be clear in this generation, as I am, that we have red lines and those are that we want this NHS to be publicly owned, publicly delivered – 100% if possible. There will always be some instances, as I said, medicines, that are effectively produced in the private sector and purchased by the NHS, but we should be very, very clear that what we want is something that represents that fundamental Labour belief.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"702","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T15:09:27Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T14:15:26Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T15:09:27Z","internalComposerCode":"57b1ce7ee4b062ce4d2238d7","internalPageCode":"2657740","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-15T21:39:18Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Then, after lunch, <a href=\"http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0017200001010\">Tony Benn stood up</a>. He promised to abolish the House of Lords, enact an industry bill “within days” of coming to power to take ownership of key private industries – and to return all powers ceded to Brussels. Even from high up in the balcony of the Blackpool Winter Gardens, I could see Benn’s eyes were on fire.</p> <p>Three years later, Labour bombed in the 1983 general election. Its manifesto, though only a pale reflection of Benn’s leftwing programme, was dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/labour.margaretthatcher\">“the longest suicide note in history”</a>. Today, with a mass influx of left-leaning members and a slump in the polls, parallels with the early 1980s are being drawn. They are almost all false.</p> <p>First, because we are at the other end of the neoliberal era, and as an economic model it is broken. Labour lost in 1979, and saw its membership almost halve because it had clung to a failing system – Keynesian economics – long after it ceased to work. All the momentum, in ideas, in broader society and among the elite, was towards the free-market, authoritarian project we now call Thatcherism. In that situation, to make traditional-left Keynesianism work, as Benn suggested, would have meant an all-out clash with both the market and the state. Labour’s poll ratings – which collapsed in Foot’s first year – were a signal that its electoral base was not up for that.</p> <p>By contrast, today neoliberal capitalism is busted, discredited and on life support. The whey-faced remnants of “old Toryism” may have crowded around the cabinet table, but their free-market philosophy has come apart. The fact that people are flooding into a left-led Labour party, not out of it, is evidence of a search for answers among broad sections of the population.</p> <p>The next most obvious difference is the absence of what we used to call the “industrial struggle”. It has been invigorating to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">Deliveroo drivers on wildcat strike</a>, together with migrant hotel cleaners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">train guards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/80-percent-junior-doctors-took-part-in-all-out-strike\">junior doctors</a> all in a single summer. But the leftism we carried with us into the Winter Gardens in 1980 had its origins in the syndicalism of ordinary workers in the 1970s. To the shop stewards I met in the years between Benn’s 1980 speech and the miners’ strike, Labour politics were a sideshow.</p> <p>The unions had achieved control of many workplaces and – it seemed – could go on calling the shots. In the year Benn made his electrifying speech, the steelworkers’ union had just won a double-digit pay rise in an all-out strike. To the wider left, of shop stewards, feminists, black community activists, a group such as Militant – which had moulded its entire practice, and even its clothing to conform with the dreariness of internal Labour life – seemed irrelevant. Its claimed membership of 2,300 in 1981 – out of 348,000 - sounds about right.</p> <p>Today, work is much less central to the left project, and for a variety of reasons. It is precarious, hard to organise. Also, the things the left wants to achieve have become more social, less industrial. There is, on the left, an implicit understanding of political philosopher Toni Negri’s claim: that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workerism\">the “factory” is now the whole of society,</a> and the subject of change is everybody – especially the networked youth.</p> <p>I do not recall many of the miners and engineers who fought for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981 being existentially devastated when he narrowly lost. They knew this was just a warm-up for the decisive battle, which would happen in barricaded pit villages four years later. This generation, by contrast, understands that the most revolutionary thing you can do to neoliberalism is to put a party in government that dismantles it.</p> <p>And that, in turn, reflects another big difference: the rule of law is stronger now. Everybody involved in the Bennite movement sensed that Britain’s legal institutions were so weak, its police, security services and judiciary so politicised, its constitution so malleable, that the scenario in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/07/past.comment\">Chris Mullin’s novel A Very British Coup</a> was not paranoia. Today, though the secret state is large, it is under much stronger legislative control. Should a leftwing Labour party come to power – either on its own or in coalition with left nationalists – it is likely to be able to govern relatively free of politicised sabotage from the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/europe-owen-smith-beats-jeremy-corbyn-labour\">When it comes to Europe, Owen Smith beats Jeremy Corbyn hands down | Neil Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels, though. As with the SDP, there is a prospect that a few entitled Labour MPs will split, and that the media will get behind the narrative that they are the “true” Labour party. Disunity has already damaged Labour in the polls, just as it did with Michael Foot.</p> <p>But the differences are what should make these, for the British left, days of hope.</p> <p>Michael Foot was a dire leader not because he was too old or too leftwing (or wore a duffel coat), but because he was a compromise candidate, constantly torn between the interests of the unions – who were largely on the right – and the membership, which had moved left. His 1983 manifesto was actually well crafted, but they were the right ideas at the wrong time.</p> <p>Whatever you think of Corbyn (I support him and will campaign to keep him as leader), today is the right time for the idea that neoliberalism is over; that the state should shape, control and sometimes suppress the market; that austerity is self-defeating; that more expeditionary warfare cannot put right the chaos and injustice Blair and Bush injected into the Middle East.</p> <p>Once we had revived our local Labour ward in Sheffield in 1980, its monthly attendance rose from the 12 pensioners and councillors that had kept it alive under Callaghan to maybe 30, one-third of whom were Trotskyists or sympathisers of the Communist party. And that was it. We achieved stuff – above all in supporting Sheffield city council when it resisted cuts. But ultimately the social forces that were driving Thatcherism were stronger. Thatcherism was the main event.</p> <p>The main event of 2016 – in England and Wales at least – is that 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. Sure, some of the same people are still around, including me, but it feels like a much bigger moment than the Benn insurgency. Anybody who thinks it is being driven, or “twisted”, by re-enactment groups from 20th-century Marxism is going to the wrong meetings.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","wordcount":"1081","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T12:03:38Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T10:43:02Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T12:03:38Z","internalComposerCode":"57b19cb6e4b062ce4d223816","internalOctopusCode":"11812228","internalPageCode":"2657245","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T13:23:25Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vvxd","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56628c7387010e54087c3b6c19ccebc6278a9798/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"43","internalShortId":"/p/5vvxd"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","webTitle":"The parallels between Jeremy Corbyn and Michael Foot are almost all false\r\n\r\n","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T12:03:38Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":"Labour leadership race","lastModified":"2016-08-17T12:20:32Z"}]}}
