The oil giant also maintains a 1,200-strong internal police force in Nigeria, plus a network of plainclothes informants.</p><p>According to the data, the world's largest company by revenue spent nearly $1bn on worldwide security between 2007-09: if it were a country Shell would have the third highest security budget in Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p><p>The documents show that nearly 40% of Shell's total security expenditure over the three year period – $383m (£244m) – was spent on protecting its staff and installations in Nigeria's volatile Niger delta region. In 2009, $65m was spent on Nigerian government forces and $75m on \"other\" security costs – believed to be a mixture of private security firms and payments to individuals.</p><p>Activists expressed concern that the escalating cost of Shell's security operation in the delta was further destabilising the oil rich region and helping to fuel rampant corruption and criminality. \"The scale of Shell's global security expenditure is colossal,\" said Ben Amunwa of London-based oil watchdog Platform. \"It is staggering that Shell transferred $65m of company funds and resources into the hands of soldiers and police known for routine human rights abuses.\"</p><p>The financial documents, <a href=\"http://t.co/fHAITY4j\">passed to Platform</a>, suggest Shell's worldwide security costs almost doubled between 2007-2009, coinciding with the rise of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/may/10/oil.world\" title=\"\">armed insurgency in the Niger delta</a>.</p><p>In 2008, 62 Shell employees or contractors were kidnapped and three killed, many Shell-operated pipelines, well heads and offshore oil platforms were attacked and the company was forced to halt oil exports for several weeks after attacks by groups including the Movement for the emancipation of the Niger delta.</p><p>Nearly a third of Shell's global security budget in 2008, or $99m, was spent on \"third parties\". This was double what the company spent on its own security staff and is believed to include the services of 600 Nigerian government police and 700 members of the controversial state \"joint task force\" (JTF) comprised of army, navy and police.</p><p>Shell denies having any direct control over JTF forces, amid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/21/hundreds-killed-niger-delta\" title=\"\">numerous accusations of human rights abuses</a>, including a large-scale military attack in 2009 which the US state department said led to the displacement and loss of livelihood of tens of thousands of residents.</p><p>But in the past Shell has supplied government forces with gunboats, helicopters, vehicles and satellite phones to better patrol the myriad creeks and waterways of the delta.</p><p>\"This proves what we in the Niger delta have known for years – that the air force, the army, the police, they are paid for with Shell money and they are all at the disposal of the company for it to use it any how it likes,\" said Celestine Nkabari at the Niger delta campaign group Social Action.</p><p>According to Platform, a significant amount of Shell funding is channelled via senior military officials which provides \"ample opportunities for corruption\". US cables, released by WikiLeaks in 2010, alleged that the company paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the deployment of 350 soldiers in the delta in 2003.</p><p>But Shell International said that any allegations of corruption should be addressed to the Nigerian authorities, and that its spending is necessary to protect its staff and operations.</p><p>Although armed insurgency in the oil producing regions of the delta has declined since a 2009 amnesty, the company says it faces widespread criminality, organised crime and massive oil theft. It has stated that 15-20% of its output is stolen by international gangs.</p><p>\"Protecting our people and our assets is Shell's highest priority,\" it said. \"Our spending on security is carefully judged to meet this objective, wherever we operate in the world. We have always acknowledged the difficulties of working in countries like Nigeria. In the period that this report refers to, the armed militancy in the Niger delta was at its height, requiring a relatively high level of security spending there.</p><p>\"All our staff and contractors are expected to adhere to the highest levels of personal and corporate ethics, as set out in our code of conduct. We support the Voluntary principles on security and human rights (VPSHR), and we recognise that these principles help maintain the safety and security of our operations in a manner consistent with upholding human rights. We also investigate grievances under the VPSHR.\"</p><p>The company declined to comment on whether worldwide costs for security were increasing because of the Arab spring. The company has recently left Syria and has interests throughout the Middle East.</p><p>But the scale of Shell's spending, revealed by the data for the first time, raises questions about the effectiveness of its security policies. \"What is striking about the amount being spent in Nigeria is its ineffectiveness,\" said Amunwa. \"Shell spent many millions of dollars each year on government forces who failed to provide the company with adequate security.\"</p><p>Nkabari said: \"Shell cannot call this spending 'security'. If it was really providing security, then why do we continue to have vandalisation, why do we have bunkering [theft of oil], why do we have the security mess that we have in the Niger delta? They give protection to the oil workers but they are not providing the region with 'security'.\"</p><p>\"These figures are alarming – it is a scandal that so much money is spent on security instead of on the local communities whose livelihoods are destroyed as a result of the oil exploitation,\" said Jaff Napoleon Bamenjo of Relufa, which campaigns for environmental justice in west Africa.</p><p>\"Across Africa oil, mining and agro-industry companies regularly pay for the services of local security forces that have deplorable human rights records; sometimes as a contractual obligation,\" said Bamenjo. \"This is an extremely unethical practice held over from the colonial era which must end immediately. Not only is it bad for local communities who are the primary victims of police and military predation, but as Shell well knows, it exposes foreign companies to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.\"</p>","headline":"Shell spending millions of dollars on security in Nigeria, leaked data shows","trailText":"<p>Internal documents reveal oil company spent $383m over three years protecting staff and installations in Niger delta region</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/19/1345397841020/Shell-in-the-Niger-delta-003.jpg","wordcount":"996","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394922833","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6561337","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Afua Hirsch and John Vidal","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1789922","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-22T17:38:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/19/shell-spending-security-nigeria-leak","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/aug/19/shell-spending-security-nigeria-leak","tags":[{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell","references":[{"type":"reuters-stock-ric","id":"reuters-stock-ric/RDSa.L"}]},{"id":"world/nigeria","webTitle":"Nigeria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nigeria","references":[]},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oil","references":[]},{"id":"business/oilandgascompanies","webTitle":"Oil and gas companies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oilandgascompanies","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/afuahirsch","webTitle":"Afua Hirsch","r2ContributorId":"28094","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/8/1289231487480/afua-hirsch.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Afua Hirsch is social affairs and education editor at Sky News and a former Guardian correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/afuahirsch","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnvidal","webTitle":"John Vidal","rcsId":"GNL001546","r2ContributorId":"15886","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/john_vidal_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Vidal is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment\">environment</a> editor.

He added that Shell was creating partnerships with non-governmental groups and aid organisations to help local communities in the delta region. </p><p>\"We have signed a partnership with USAid &#91;the US Agency for International Development&#93; to develop capacity in agriculture, health and business enterprise, and with Africare &#91;a non-governmental organisation&#93; on reducing deaths from malaria,\" Mr Buerk said.</p><p>The Niger delta is rich in oil but is also an area of great poverty, creating a volatile situation. The two million barrels of oil pumped from the delta each day provide more than 90% of Nigeria's foreign income, but the delta communities have little to show for it beyond contamination and violence, with youths resorting to hostage-taking and extortion. </p><p>Emmanuel Etomi, the community development manager for the Shell Development Company of Nigeria, said on Shell's website: \"I live in a society in serious conflict. This is being fed by corruption, poverty and high unemployment among youth in a region where little of the oil wealth has been returned to the people.\"</p><p>Mr Etomi, alluding to the report commissioned by Shell, said research by conflict experts had highlighted how the company \"sometimes feeds conflict by the way we award contracts, gain access to land, and deal with community representatives; how ill-equipped our security team is to reduce conflict; and how drastically conflict reduces the effect of our community development programme\".</p><p>The confidential report comes at an already difficult time for Shell, which is struggling with the aftershock of downgrades of its oil reserves by one fifth. The downgrades were followed by the resignation of chairman Sir Philip Watts and explorations director Walter van de Vijver. </p><p>Around one third of the recent reserves downgrade came in Nigeria, where oil and gas account for 10% of Shell's current production. </p><p>With Nigeria a thorn in its side, it was little small surprise that Shell was considering a 20% reduction of its Nigerian workforce, although cutting 1,000 jobs in a poor country could further strain the company's relations with the Nigerian government. </p><p>Those are already difficult, with the civilian government of Olesegun Obasanjo trying to recover hundreds of millions of pounds worth of tax credits handed to oil companies during previous military dictatorships. </p><p>Shell's record in the Niger delta has come under fire from environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth.</p><p>Brian Shaad, a parliamentary campaigner for the group, who has just returned from the Niger delta, said it was unlikely that Shell would get out of Nigeria because it accounted for an important chunk of the company's production.</p><p>\"What is clear from meeting a number of communities is that Shell is not meeting its environmental and social expectations of the community,\" he said. \"However, many leaders do not want Shell to necessarily pull out, but to behave itself.\"</p><p>Mr Shaad spoke of frustration among the delta communities because their first point of contact with the company often came through Shell's security forces, a situation he described as \"guns first\". </p><p>He said there was also frustration among those working for Shell, because workers were employed by subcontractors rather than the company, meaning that they did not get the full benefits accorded to full Shell employees.</p><p>Mr Shaad also criticised the Nigerian government for what he called lax standards in regulating the behaviour of oil companies, which have long stood accused of not cleaning up oil spills and pipeline blowouts.</p><p>The problems at Shell have attracted the attention of Calpers, the largest US pension fund, which has demanded a high-level review of its boardroom structure. </p><p>The California public employee's retirement scheme has put the oil group on its annual list of companies needing to boost performance.</p>","headline":"Shell 'may have to leave Nigeria'","trailText":"<p>The embattled Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell was today facing fresh embarrassment as an internal report said it could have to pull out of Nigeria because of violence in the Niger delta region.</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/dmhc","wordcount":"762","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"4945275","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Tran","internalPageCode":"272388","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jun/11/oilandpetrol.money","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2004/jun/11/oilandpetrol.money","tags":[{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oil","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"profile/marktran","webTitle":"Mark Tran","rcsId":"GNL004704","r2ContributorId":"16072","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/11/08/mark_tran_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Mark Tran reports on general news.

Next month, 14 years after his execution, the Nigerian environmental activist's dying wish is to be fulfilled. </p><p>In a New York federal court, Shell and one of its senior executives are to face charges that in the early 1990s in Nigeria they were complicit in human rights abuses, including summary execution and torture. </p><p>The Anglo-Dutch company, if found liable, could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages. No multinational has ever been found guilty  of human rights abuses, although two previous cases saw major claims settled outside court.</p><p>Saro-Wiwa became famous as a campaigner on behalf of the Ogoni people, leading peaceful protests against the environmental damage caused by oil companies in the Niger Delta. There was worldwide condemnation when, along with eight other activists, he was hanged by the Nigerian military government in 1995 after being charged with incitement to murder after the death of four Ogoni elders. Many of the prosecution witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed to give evidence against Saro-Wiwa, who was a respected television writer and businessman. </p><p>Lawyers in New York will allege that Shell actively subsidised a campaign of terror by security forces in the Niger Delta and attempted to influence the trial that led to Saro-Wiwa's execution. The lawsuit alleges that the company attempted to bribe two witnesses in his trial to testify against him. Members of Saro-Wiwa's family will take the stand for the first time to give their version of events, among them his brother Owens, who will allege that Brian Anderson, managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, told him: \"It would not be impossible to get charges dropped if protests were called off.\" Anderson is fighting the action.</p><p>Witnesses who were shot by military police in the Niger Delta principally to protect the building of Shell's oil pipeline will allege that Shell, by paying the police to protect its interests, was complicit in acts of violence.</p><p>Speaking to the Observer from Abuja, Nigeria, Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Wiwa, said: \"For 14 years we have lived with the memory of a father, an uncle, a brother, a son executed for a crime he didn't commit. We have daily reminders. It's painful to live with a monstrous injustice. To wake up one day to finally get our day in court is tremendously satisfying.</p><p>\"After the injustice of the original crime against my father, having to watch legal arguments [by Shell] using the highest-paid lawyers in the world is sickening. You can't describe how painful that is to go through. </p><p>\"Part of the reason for the original protest was the way Shell behaved. Ogoni people made their living farming and fishing, but Shell was using open waste pits and oil pipelines criss-crossed the land. These polluting activities were put on top of a delicate ecosystem. It destroyed people's ability to sustain themselves. That's the impact of Shell and, when people tried to protest, they were brutally repressed.\"</p><p>In a statement, Shell this weekend described the executions of the Ogoni 9 as \"tragic events carried out by the Nigerian government in power at the time\".</p><p>\"Shell attempted to persuade that government to grant clemency; to our deep regret, that appeal - and the appeals of many others - went unheard, and we were shocked and saddened when we heard the news. Shell in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence against them or their fellow Ogonis. We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events. The allegations made in the complaints against Royal Dutch/Shell concerning the 1995 executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight fellow Ogonis are false and without merit.\"</p><p>US lawyers have finally won permission to bring the case to court under the alien tort statute, which gives non-US citizens the right to file claims in American courts for international human rights violations. The court case had been set for 27 April, though last night the date was moved to 26 May.</p><p>Today the oil-producing Niger Delta region is riven by intense violence and corruption. The Ogoni 9 trial is seen as a way of coming to terms with the past and building a non-violent future. </p><p>\"We need to know the truth,\" said Ken Wiwa last night. \"We need to have people account for their role in the executions and the displacement of the Ogoni people, many of whom feel traumatised. It will be a relief. It will enable people to face the future. That's the most important thing. Let's account for the past, so we can move forward.\"</p><p>Lawyers representing Saro-Wiwa's family have not sought specific damages should Shell be found liable, but legal experts say the oil giant could face fines running into hundreds of millions of pounds. </p><p>Jenny Green, a senior lawyer at the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, who has played a pivotal role in ensuring the Saro-Wiwa case made it to court, said: \"Mosop [the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People] was formed to stand up to multinationals and the dictatorship that acted hand-in-hand. This is a significant moment, because it says you can't act with impunity.\"</p>","headline":"Shell in court over alleged role in Nigeria executions","trailText":"<p>Family of executed Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa take oil giant to court in New York</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"31","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2009/01/29/shellt.jpg","wordcount":"869","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"345529995","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Mathiason","newspaperEditionDate":"2009-04-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1195264","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2009-04-07T23:09:21Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/05/shell-saro-wiwa-execution-charges","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/apr/05/shell-saro-wiwa-execution-charges","tags":[{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell","references":[{"type":"reuters-stock-ric","id":"reuters-stock-ric/RDSa.L"}]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/nigeria","webTitle":"Nigeria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nigeria","references":[]},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/human-rights","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/oilandgascompanies","webTitle":"Oil and gas companies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oilandgascompanies","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nickmathiason","webTitle":"Nick Mathiason","rcsId":"GNL003503","r2ContributorId":"16184","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/10/08/nick_mathiason_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nick Mathiason is business correspondent at the <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> and also works with the <a href=\"http://www.financialtaskforce.org/\">Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic Development</a>.

Why so little, we might ask?</p><p>The UNEP has now admitted this figure is based on data from the oil industry and the Nigerian government. It's not surprising that this is in line with what Shell used to claim in the 1980s – that about 80% of the oil spills were caused by vandalism or sabotage. This claim that infrastructure has been sabotaged is particularly attractive to oil companies, because they are then exempted from paying compensation for any resulting spills. Why accept responsibility for polluting the locals' creeks, swamps and farmlands and destroying their livelihoods when you can blame the very same people for the mess now coating their own backyards with a toxic gloss?</p><p>Yet crucial expertise which could have painted a very different picture was sidelined. Prof Richard Steiner, an international expert on oil spills, was contracted to write the manual on oil damage assessment and restoration by the UNEP in 2004. But when Shell hired the agency to carry out the present study, Steiner's offer to provide scientific advice and guidance to the Ogoniland report was declined.</p><p>Steiner has already said that the findings now uncovered are incorrect, and has gone on to say: \"Our earlier results suggest that much of the oil spilled there was due to poor practice by Shell, rather than bunkering and sabotage… it is entirely implausible that 90% of the oil spilled was due to bunkering [the act of criminal gangs stealing oil].\" In short, his opinion is that this is not an independent, credible assessment.</p><p>The report does indeed rely heavily on figures produced by oil companies and Nigerian state statistics rather than on testimonies from those most affected – the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/aug/22/niger-delta-oil-pollution\" title=\"\">communities in Ogoniland</a>.</p><p>The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency of Nigeria has reported a total of 3,203 oil spills in the Niger Delta region in the last four years alone.</p><p>That list lengthens every day. The records of the Nigerian Directorate of Petroleum Resources show that nearly 2.5m barrels of crude oil were spilt between 1976 and 1996. Most damning of all, 77% of this oil was not recovered and contaminated the local environment. This is an environmental catastrophe which has a long history – some notable past spills include the Escravos spill of 1978 in which 300,000 barrels of crude oil was spilled into the coastal waters and another, in the same year, caused by tank failure at Forcados Terminal in which 580,000 barrels were spewed into the environment.</p><p>It is in this polluted environment that the people of Ogoniland have had to live for decades with spill after spill. The UNEP must be, and be seen to be, an independent arbiter of what has really happened there. There should be no room for suspicion that the $10m (£6.5m) Shell paid the agency for this report will influence the outcome.</p><p></p><p>• Nnimmo Bassey is chairman of Friends of the Earth

A familiar sight to locals, it is known as the \"Christmas tree\". But unlike its innocuous namesake, this \"tree\" is an abandoned oil wellhead owned by oil multinational Shell. According to environmentalists, the wellhead <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/niger-delta-bears-brunt-after-50-years-of-oil-spills-421634.html\" title=\"Independent: Niger Delta bears brunt after 50 years of oil spills\">spewed toxic oil and gas</a> into the land and fish ponds of local villagers for months in August 2006, and again in 2007. As of May 2008, the area around the Christmas tree was still heavily polluted and villagers remain destitute.</p><p>This is one of three oil spills in the case against Shell that will begin its first hearing at The Hague civil court this week. Four Nigerian villagers, in conjunction with Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands), are charging Royal Dutch Shell with causing massive oil spills that have resulted in loss of livelihoods. The case provides a snapshot of the environmental and social devastation caused by Shell in the Niger Delta.</p><p>The bigger, more disturbing picture is that oil spills have contaminated the once fertile Delta with approximately 1.5m tonnes of crude oil, equivalent to one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill\" title=\"Wikipedia: Exxon Valdez oil spill\">Exxon Valdez disaster</a> every year for the last 50 years. As <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/oil-industry-has-brought-poverty-and-pollution-to-niger-delta-20090630\" title=\"Amnesty International: Oil industry has brought poverty and pollution\">Amnesty International pointed out</a> in a report this July, Shell \"has failed to respect the human rights of the people of the Niger Delta … through failure to prevent and mitigate pollution\".</p><p>The parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, denies responsibility for the pollution of its subsidiary, Shell Nigeria, and is challenging the jurisdiction of the Dutch court over its actions abroad. It also blames oil spills on sabotage to its equipment. It seems that if Shell had its way, no court would have jurisdiction over any violations of human rights and environmental law. In 2005, the federal high court of Nigeria declared Shell's gas flaring to be a violation of human rights and ordered the company to stop the illegal practice. <a href=\"http://www.climatelaw.org/cases/country/nigeria/media/2007May2/\" title=\"Climate Justice: Shell fails to obey court order\">Shell has still not complied</a> with this court order. With little or no legal remedy in Nigeria, villagers from the Niger Delta have decided to bring their case to The Hague to hold the company headquarters to account.</p><p>Should the case go forward, the court would hear about Shell's systematic pollution across the region. In Goi, a <a href=\"http://www.milieudefensie.nl/english/publications/Goi-english.pdf\" title=\"Milieudefensie: The case Goi (PDF)\">massive oil spill</a> from Shell's Trans-Niger pipeline caught fire in 2005, incinerating farmland, property and polluting fisheries. It took 33 months before Shell cleaned up the mess. Chief Barizaa, an Ogoni elder, and one of the four plaintiffs in the case said: \"I lost everything … the oil flowed into my fishponds and killed all my fish. The five canoes I had in the creeks were consumed by the inferno. I have nothing left to feed my family.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.milieudefensie.nl/english/publications/Oruma-english.pdf\" title=\"Milieudefensie: The case Oruma (PDF)\">Another oil spill flowed from a high-pressure pipeline</a> in Oruma, Bayelsa state, in 2005, polluting the land and drinking water of several neighbouring communities. Shell waited 12 days before containing the spill, and four months later it began its clean-up operation by dumping the polluted soil into pits and setting them on fire, causing further damage to the environment.</p><p>The oil-rich Niger Delta is prized by multinational corporations; chief among them is Shell, which derives approximately <a href=\"http://www.annualreview.shell.com/2008/servicepages/about_disclaimer.php\" title=\"Royal Dutch Shell plc Annual Review\">10% of its global profits</a> from the region. The oil companies have made enormous profits and enriched a succession of Nigerian regimes, but pollution is driving local people into poverty. Until Shell takes responsibility for its impact on the environment and human rights, it can expect legal actions like this one to expose ugly truths about their polluting practices. Shell must bear the cost of its environmental devastation. The alternative is daily injustice on a massive scale.</p>","headline":"Shell must clean up its act in Nigeria","trailText":"<strong>Chima Williams:</strong> As Nigerian villagers take Shell to court over huge oil spills, it's time for the group to take responsibility for polluting practices","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/4/1259923770533/shell.jpg","wordcount":"658","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"356414117","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"2777062","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Chima Williams","internalPageCode":"1314529","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2009-12-07T12:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/04/shell-nigeria-oil-spills","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/04/shell-nigeria-oil-spills","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green","webTitle":"Cif green","description":"Latest comment is free opinion on environmental issues","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"environment/oil-spills","webTitle":"Oil spills","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-spills","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/oil-spills","references":[]},{"id":"world/nigeria","webTitle":"Nigeria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nigeria","references":[]},{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell","references":[{"type":"reuters-stock-ric","id":"reuters-stock-ric/RDSa.L"}]},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oil","references":[]},{"id":"environment/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/oil","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"environment/pollution","webTitle":"Pollution","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/pollution","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/chima-williams","webTitle":"Chima Williams","r2ContributorId":"35481","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/3/1259855654770/chima.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Chima Williams is a lawyer by profession.

Its chief executive officer has even hinted that the company can no longer depend on Nigeria as a profit-maker, despite its 50-year history in the country.</p><p>The majority of the total, according to the company, was lost through two incidents – one in which thieves damaged a wellhead at its Odidi field, and another where militants bombed the Trans Escravos pipeline. In all, some 13,900 tonnes spilled into the swamps, but Shell said it was able to recover nearly 10,000 tonnes of that.</p><p>In its <a href=\"http://sustainabilityreport.shell.com/2009/ouroperationsinfocus/nigeria.html?cat=b\" title=\"annual environment report released Tuesday\">annual environment report, released yesterday</a>, Shell also quadrupled its original estimate of oil spilled during normal operations in 2008 to 8,800 tonnes, blaming an explosion in November of that year at its Iriama field for the increase.</p><p>The government is aware of the spills, and Shell has properly taken care of the damage and remains \"involved in serious clean-up exercises\", said Levi Ajonuma, a spokesman for the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.</p><p>Responding to the spills remains difficult, however, as Shell's workers are increasingly seen by criminal gangs as lucrative kidnap targets.

In one case last year, Shell is said to have transferred more than $159,000 (£102,000) to a group credibly linked to militia violence.</p><p>One gang member, Chukwu Azikwe, told Platform: \"We were given money and that is the money we were using to buy ammunition, to buy this bullet, and every other thing to eat and to sustain the war.\" He said his gang and its leader, SK Agala, had vandalised Shell pipelines. \"They will pay ransom. Some of them in the management will bring out money, dole out money into this place, in cash.\"</p><p>The gang became locked in competition witha rival group over access to oil money, with payments to one faction provoking a violent reaction from the other. \"The [rival gang] will come and fight, some will die, just to enable them to also get [a] share. So the place now becomes a contest ground for warring factions. Who takes over the community has the attention of the company.\"</p><p>Platform alleges that it was highly likely that Shell knew that thousands of dollars paid per month to militants in the town of Rumuekpe was used to sustain a bitter conflict. \"Armed gangs waged pitched battles over access to oil money, which Shell distributed to whichever gang controlled access to its infrastructure.\"</p><p>Rumuekpe is \"the main artery of Shell's eastern operations in Rivers state\", with aroundabout 100,000 barrels of oil flowing per day, approximately10% of Shell's daily production in the country. Shell distributed \"community development\" funds and contracts via Friday Edu, a youth leader and Shell community liaison officer, the report said, an exclusive arrangement that magnified the risk of communal tension and conflict.</p><p>By 2005, Edu's monopoly over the resources of the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) had sparked a leadership tussle with Agala's group. The latter was reportedly forced out of the community and a number of people killed. Dozens of gang members and residents reportedly died in counter raids by Agala.</p><p>The inter-communal  violence killed an estimated 60 people, including women and children, from 2005-08. Thousands more were displaced by fighting that left homes, schools and churches  in ruins. Many still suffer severe malnutrition, poverty  and homelessness.</p><p>Platform says the local conflict soon created regional instability. Displaced villagers were hunted down in the regional capital, Port Harcourt, and killed in their homes, schools and workplaces. Gangs active in Rumuekpe collaborated with prominent criminal networks in Rivers state and doubled as Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (Mend) militants.</p><p>Mend's activity in Rumuekpe seriously disrupted Shell's operations and sent shockwaves through world markets, the report notes, yet Shell paid little heed. One of the corporation's managers was alarmingly candid: \"One good thing about their crisis was that they never for one day stopped us from production.\"</p><p>Platform interviewed Ex-gang members claimed Shell exacerbated the conflict by providing regular funding to both factions throughout.</p><p>In 2006, Shell is alleged to have awarded maintenance contracts relating to its oil wells, the Trans-Niger pipeline, its booster station and flowstation to Edu's gang. But after Agala's counter-raid left Rumuekpe \"littered\" with corpses, Shell apparently switched sides and started paying Agala. It paid whoever controlled access, even if they were known criminal gangs, Platform claims.</p><p>The allegations of ex-gang members were largely substantiated by the testimony of a Shell official, Platform claims. A manager confirmed that in 2006, one of the most violent years, Shell awarded six types of contract in Rumuekpe. Thousands of dollars flowed from Shell to the armed gangs each month.</p><p>The company eventually terminated some, though not all, of the contracts. But by then the violence had reached the Shell flowstation. A Shell manager, whose name has been withheld, is quoted as saying: \"Somebody came in [to the flowstation] and cut off somebody's hand. We had to vacate the place. We stopped the contract entirely.\"</p><p>Other contracts to \"maintain the pipeline right of way\" continued throughout the entire conflict, as did one-off contracts created in response to specific threats, the report found.</p><p>Matthew Chizi, a local youth leader, said: \"[Shell] were going to their job, doing their operation, servicing their manifold. They never cared that people were dying. They never did anything to call the crisis to order. Rather they were using military to intimidate the community.\"</p><p>Platform's report offers a damning assessment: \"Shell was highly likely to be aware that it was helping to fuel the conflict in Rumuekpe, since company workers visited the community on a regular basis. Even if Shell was somehow unaware of the violence, media reports were publicly available.</p><p>\"Members of the community reportedly wrote to Shell to request that the company stop awarding contracts to gang leaders such as Friday Edu. Through Shell's routine practices and responses to threats, the company became complicit in the cycle of violence.\"It adds: \"The Rumuekpe crisis was entirely avoidable... Shell operated for decades without an MoU, polluted the community and distributed 'community development' funds through an individual who had lost the confidence of the community. Once conflict erupted, Shell paid the perpetrators of gross human rights abuses as long as they controlled access to oil infrastructure. The cumulative impact of Shell's mistakes was devastating.\"</p><p>Rumuekpe is just one of several case studies examined by the report which alleges, that in 2009 and 2010, security personnel guarding Shell facilities were responsible for extra-judicial killings and torture in Ogoniland. Platform calls on the corporation to break ties with government forces and other armed groups responsible for abuses, and to clean up environmental damage.</p><p>Rumuekpe is just one of several case studies examined by the report which alleges, that in 2009 and 2010, security personnel guarding Shell facilities were responsible for extra-judicial killings and torture in Ogoniland.</p><p>Shell insisted that it respected human rights and was committed to working with Nigeria to ensure that the country benefited from its natural resources. \"We have long acknowledged that the legitimate payments we make to contractors, as well as the social investments we make in the Niger delta region may cause friction in and between communities,\" a spokesman said. \"We nevertheless work hard to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the benefits of our presence.</p><p>\"In view of the high rate of criminal violence in the Niger delta, the federal government, as majority owner of oil facilities, deploys government security forces to protect people and assets. Suggestions in the report that SPDC directs or controls military activities are therefore completely untrue.\"</p><p>He added: \"It is unfortunate that Platform has repeated several old cases, some of which are unsubstantiated and some proven inaccurate, because doing so obscures the good work which has been going on for many years. However, we will carefully examine its recommendations and look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with the Nigerian government and other stakeholders to find solutions to these issues.\"</p>","headline":"Shell accused of fuelling violence in Nigeria by paying rival militant gangs","trailText":"<p>Oil company rejects watchdog's claims that its local contracts made it

The British courts may now be inundated with legitimate complaints,\" said Patrick Naagbartonm, coordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.cehrd.org/\" title=\"\">Centre of Environment and Human Rights</a> in Port Harcourt.</p><p>Later this week the company will be heavily implicated by the UN for the environmental disaster in the Niger delta which has seen more than 7,000 oil spills in the low lying swamps and farmland since 1989. Shell first discovered oil in the Niger delta in 1956. According to Amnesty International, more than 13m barrels of oil have been spilt in the delta, twice as much as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/13/deepwater-horizon-gulf-mexico-oil-spill\" title=\"\">by BP in last year's Gulf of Mexico spill</a>.</p><p>The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report, funded by Shell, will be presented to president <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/17/goodluck-jonathan-nigeria-election\" title=\"\">Goodluck Jonathan</a> on Thursday and is expected to be released on Friday in London.</p><p>UNEP's report, the first peer-reviewed scientific study of more than 60 spills, is expected to say that oil pollution in Ogoniland is much worse than previously believed, having sunk deep into the water table. Many spills have not been cleared up since 1970 and the effects on the local economy, health and development have been severe. The report will not apportion blame for individual spills.</p><p>International oil spill assessment experts who have seen the Bodo spill believe that it could cost the company more than $100m to clean up properly and restore the devastated mangrove forests that used to line the creeks and rivers but which have been killed by the oil.</p><p>Proceedings against Royal Dutch Shell and Shell petroleum development company (SPDC) Nigeria began in the high court on 6 April 2011. Last week Shell Nigeria said: \"SPDC accepts responsibility under the Oil Pipelines Act for the two oil spills both of which were due to equipment failure. SPDC acknowledges that it is liable to pay compensation - to those who are entitled to receive such compensation.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-377615205'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2011/8/4/1312447641803/Map-Ogoniland-in-Nigeria-001.gif' alt='Map: Ogoniland in Nigeria' width='460' height='697' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Map: Ogoniland in Nigeria Photograph: Guardian</figcaption></figure>","headline":"Shell accepts liability for two oil spills in Nigeria","trailText":"<p>Oil giant faces a bill of hundreds of millions of dollars following class action suit brought on behalf of communities in Bodo, Ogoniland</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2011/8/3/1312364069886/The-impact-of-an-oil-spil-003.jpg","wordcount":"722","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"377531503","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5020469","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"John Vidal in Bodo","newspaperEditionDate":"2011-08-04T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1615212","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-08-06T10:07:52Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/03/shell-liability-oil-spills-nigeria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/aug/03/shell-liability-oil-spills-nigeria","tags":[{"id":"environment/oil-spills","webTitle":"Oil spills","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-spills","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/oil-spills","references":[]},{"id":"environment/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/oil","references":[]},{"id":"environment/energy","webTitle":"Energy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/energy","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell","references":[{"type":"reuters-stock-ric","id":"reuters-stock-ric/RDSa.L"}]},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oil","references":[]},{"id":"business/oilandgascompanies","webTitle":"Oil and gas companies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/oilandgascompanies","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"world/nigeria","webTitle":"Nigeria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nigeria","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnvidal","webTitle":"John Vidal","rcsId":"GNL001546","r2ContributorId":"15886","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/john_vidal_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Vidal is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment\">environment</a> editor.

On the fifth count, Shell was ordered to pay compensation, of an amount yet to be decided.</p><p>The case was brought in the Netherlands because of Shell's dual headquartership, being both Dutch and British, and was brought by four Nigerian farmers co-sponsored by the international green campaigning group Friends of the Earth.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.foeeurope.org/Watershed-Dutch-court-ruling-against-Shell-300113\" title=\"\">a statement</a>, Friends of the Earth Netherlands said: \"This verdict is great news for the people in lkot Ada Udo who started this case together with Milieudefensie [Friends of the Earth Netherlands]. But the verdict also offers hope to other victims of environmental pollution caused by multinationals. At the same time, the verdict is a bitter disappointment for the people in the villages of Oruma and Goi – where the court did not rule to hold Shell liable for the damage. Fortunately, this can still change in an appeal.\"</p><p>Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International's Africa programme director, said: \"Clearly it's good news that one of the plaintiffs in this case managed to clamber over all the obstacles to something approaching justice. However, the fact that the other plaintiffs' claims were dismissed underscores the very serious obstacles people from the Niger Delta face in accessing justice when their lives have been destroyed by oil pollution.\"</p><p>Shell's subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, said the main cause of oil spills in the country was from people taking oil for illegal refineries. Mutiu Sunmonu, managing director of SPDC said: \"We welcome the court's ruling that all spill cases were caused by criminal activity. Oil pollution is a problem in Nigeria, affecting the daily lives of people in the Niger Delta. However, the vast majority of oil pollution is caused by oil thieves and illegal refiners. This causes major environmental and economic damage, and is the real tragedy of the Niger Delta.\"</p><p>He added: \"SPDC has made great efforts to raise awareness of the issue with the government of Nigeria, international bodies like the UN, the media and NGOs. We will continue to be at the forefront of discussions to find solutions. For SPDC no oil spill is acceptable and we are working hard to improve our performance on operational spills. In the past years we have seen a decline in operational spill volumes. These spills, however, were caused by sabotage and the court has, quite rightly, largely dismissed the claims.\"</p><p>The case turned on whether Shell was responsible for the spills, through negligence and a failure to invest in proper safety systems of the kind that are required in developed countries, as the campaigners alleged, or whether – as Shell argued – the spills were mainly the result of local people attempting to steal oil from pipelines.</p><p>It is understood that the court took the view that four of the spills were caused by sabotage, as people tried to extract oil for their own purposes. In the case of the fifth, the finding was that Shell had been negligent in failing to prevent such sabotage.</p><p>But the farmers and green campaigners are expected to appeal against the verdict to a higher court.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/23/shell-attacked-niger-oil-spill-clean-up-delay\" title=\"\">Shell is accused of widespread spills across the regions of Nigeria where it operates</a>, but the allegations in question concerned incidents in Goi, Ogoniland, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom.</p><p>\"There is an atmosphere of celebration here – the community feels that some justice has been done,\" said Ken Henshaw, a Niger Delta activist from campaign group Social Action which has closely followed the case. \"A precedent has been set, it has been made known that shell can be liable for damages and loss of livelihood.\"</p><p>\"We didn't win all the cases, but we won one, and that one is a precedent,\" Henshaw added. \"We are prepared to appeal the other ones. Shell tries to give the impression that the oil spills are caused by sabotage, but we are convincied that it was not sabotage. It is the result of equipment failure and neglect on the part of Shell.\"</p><p>\"We are emboldened by this victory, we feel confident that we will definitely succeed on appeal. This is a major threshold, now that we have crossed it, we can bring more claims. The communities who have had their lives ruined by oil companies now feel galvanized to take action.\"</p><p>Plantiffs from Ikot Ada Udo, Akwa Ibom State, whose case was successful, said they were now looking forward to compensation for their loss of livelihood.</p><p>\"We were successful today, and I am happy, I know that the judgment has been divinely directed,\" said Elder Friday Akpan, 55, from the Ikot Abasi area of Akwa ibom state, whose 47 catfish farms were destroyed following pollution from an oil spill, a claim which the court upheld as caused by a breach of Shell Nigeria's duty of care.</p><p>\"The fishes died completely. I was confused because it left me completely empty,\" Akpan added. \"I did not have some money to pay school fees for my twelve children, and nothing to allow me to earn my livelihood again. Debts I had borrowed I could not repay. There was nothing for me. I was finished.\"</p><p>One lawyer involved in the case said that it was right to see it as a victory.</p><p>\"There are positives and negatives from this case,\" said Prince Chima Williams, head the legal affairs department at the Environmental Rights Action group. \"It is positive in the sense that the court has found Shell liable for the environmental destruction in Akwa Ibom State. It is positive because it means that Nigerian citizens can now drag Shell to court in Holland for its actions and inactions in their communities.\"</p><p>\"The negative aspect is that the court refused to agree with us Shell's negligence caused the other oil spills. Because we disagree with the court on that position, and that is why our first priority now is going to be to appeal the judgment,\" Williams added.</p><p>The case has cast a spotlight on the power which Shell wields in Nigeria, amidst allegations that the Nigerian authorities would not have enforced the judgment had the case been brought in local courts.</p><p>\"Shell do not admit mistakes,\" said Akpan. They would not obey a judgment in a Nigerian court. When they know that the judgment is in Holland it's better.\"</p><p>\"We considered all the options and the history of litigation in Nigeria before deciding to take the case to Holland,\" said Williams. \"We could not have confidence in the judiciary in Nigeria because, coming from our experience, when the judiciary gives a judgment, the enforcement of that judgment by the executive becomes a problem.\"</p><p>\"Shell is a very stubborn company, and in Nigeria, in some situations, it is more powerful than the Nigerian government,\" Williams added.</p><p>Activists believe that the case will have a longer-term effect on attitudes within communities affected by oil spills in Nigeria.</p><p>\"In the long run a case like this will promote self-help among communities, because they know that if they know they can go to court in Holland, they can obtain a judgment that will be complied with, from which they can reap the benefits\" said Williams.</p><p>The level of damages is yet to be determined. \"In the case itself we didn't make specific demands for an amount, so the next step will be for the community to assist the court with an assessment of the actual loss that should be compensated,\" said Williams.</p>","headline":"Shell acquitted of Nigeria pollution charges","trailText":"<p>The case involved five allegations of oil spills in Nigeria, four of which were quashed by
