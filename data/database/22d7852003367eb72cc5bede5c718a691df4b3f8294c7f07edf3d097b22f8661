exception to the suggestion, but his team did lose momentum with his substitutions in Paris","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-06T13:09:00Z","body":"<h2>A RARE RUFFLING</h2><p>Stuart Lancaster has rarely been ruffled in the two years he has been in charge of England, but he this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/03/stuart-lancaster-england-replacements-six-nations\" title=\"\">took exception to suggestions that his replacements</a> in Paris last Saturday had helped turn<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/01/france-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\"> a winning position against France into a defeat</a>.</p><p>England were 21-16 up when Dylan Hartley (58min) and Danny Care (61) were replaced, having scored 18 unanswered points in 20 minutes either side of half-time. Lancaster did not empty his bench – Dan Cole remained on the field throughout with the uncapped Henry Thomas remaining in reserve – but when Owen Farrell suffered cramp in the final eight minutes, the fly-half had to carry on.</p><p>Lancaster said on Monday that he did not predetermine his replacements, nor did he rely on scientific data: he uses his instinct and intuition. He pointed out that Care, one of England's catalysts in Paris, had played only 49 minutes in January, starting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/11/harlequins-clermont-auvergne-heineken-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Harlequins' Heineken Cup defeat to Clermont Auvergne</a>, and he felt the scrum-half had reached his limit in a game where the ball was in play for some 20% longer than it had been against New Zealand in November.</p><p>Looking at England's matches in the last year, Lancaster tends to replace his scrum-half at around the same time: twice on 57 minutes in last year's Six Nations, once on 58 and once on 64; the time in the summer Tests in Argentina was 53 and 55 and in the three November internationals it was 52, 54 and 65.</p><p>There was one exception: when England beat Ireland in Dublin last February, Lancaster kept both his half-backs, then Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell, on the field throughout. He said that, given the difficult conditions caused by the wind and rain, he was concerned that changing players in such pivotal positions would have been a risk in a tight match. And so he didn't and England won.</p><p>In Paris 2012, Lancaster waited until the 72nd-minute before changing scrum-halves while Hartley was taken off with six minutes to go. Again, England won. As he says, knowing when to make replacements is an inexact science but he makes more changes than the Wales head coach Warren Gatland, someone who is keen on a high ball in play time, and there is a significant difference in the way the two sides finish matches.</p><p>In nine matches in the last year – excluding the summer tour to Argentina when both countries were below strength – England's statistics show that they are at their most effective in the third quarter of a match and at their most vulnerable in the final 20 minutes.</p><p>Breaking the matches down into quarters, England have scored 50 points in the opening 20 minutes and conceded 59, the latter figure inflated by their poor starts in their last two outings against France and New Zealand; the second quarter is 50-29 in their favour and the third a stark 59-25, but in the final 20 minutes they have scored 29 points and conceded 43.</p><p>They lost three of the nine matches, to Wales, New Zealand and France, and the tally in the final quarter shows England scored three points compared with the 33 of their opponents, Alex Goode's penalty in Paris last weekend, and conceded one try each time.</p><p>England's two tries in the final quarter in the nine matches came when victory had been assured, against Scotland and Argentina. They were both scored in the final minutes by replacements, Care and Ben Morgan, and in four of the games, France at home last year, Italy, Australia and Argentina, they did not concede a point in the last 20 minutes and held Ireland to three.</p><p>Wales are at their strongest at the end of a match. Again excluding their summer tour, to Japan, in their 10 matches from February last year, they concede fewest points in the final quarter: their aggregates are 70-55 in the first, 52-39 in the second, 69-40 in the third and 52-14 in the fourth. No one scored a point against them after the 60th minute in the 2012 Six Nations, although Italy did so last Saturday with an interception try.</p><p>Gatland uses his replacements more sparingly than Lancaster. At Twickenham two years ago, he made two changes, one of them enforced at half-time because Jamie Roberts had suffered a knee injury. In Dublin in the opening round that year, he brought on three replacements and again one of them was because of injury.</p><p>Wales won at Twickenham with a try in the final quarter, scored by the player who replaced Roberts, Scott Williams, having triumphed in Dublin with a late penalty. Gatland tends to empty his bench only when victory is assured, as he did in the Lions' final Test against Australia last July, something Wales had done in his absence against England in the final round of the Six Nations when six players were brought on in the final seven minutes.</p><p>Gatland leaves his scrum-half on for longer than Lancaster with the change, on average, around the 70-minute mark. While he has not had a strong challenger to Mike Phillips in the position in the last few seasons, he tends to make the switch some 10 minutes from time when Wales play a second-tier nation and Phillips is rested.</p><p>England's decline in the final quarter of matches may have nothing to do with the replacements they make but is it more likely to do with conditioning given the attention lavished on that area by all professional sides?</p><p>The Wales captain Sam Warburton said this week that he found it hard coming off the bench in a Test match because a replacement had to quickly adapt to the tempo and mood of a game. What England gained in fresh legs in Paris, they lost in momentum. Seven players in a team have to go the distance because there are only eight replacements so why not more?</p><p></p><h2>WALES AND IRELAND BATTLE WITH FAVOURITISM ALLERGY</h2><p></p><p>The opening round of the Six Nations produced three home victories, and if that does not sound extraordinary, it was the first time it had happened since 2006.</p><p>That is the only other occasion when there has not been an away victory on the first weekend. Italy beat Ireland by 10 points eight years ago, England thrashed Wales at Twickenham and Scotland beat France 20-16 at Murrayfield, still the only match <em>Les Bleus</em> have lost in a campaign after a Lions tour in the professional era.</p><p>The odds on three more home successes this weekend will be long, although France will be backed to beat Italy. Scotland will probably need the help of their worm-infested pitch to see off England, but the anomalous fixture is in Dublin in a fixture where the word welcome has been appropriate in the past 30 years.</p><p>Since 1983, matches between Ireland and Wales have produced eight home victories, one draw and 21 away successes. In that time, Wales have only twice won in Cardiff: in 2005, in a match that secured the grand slam, and six years later when a disputed try by Mike Phillips proved the difference between the sides.</p><p>There was period, from the end of the 1980s through most of the next decade, when the fixture tended to decide the destiny of the wooden spoon and there were some desultory games then: think 1990, a week after Scotland had beaten England in the grand-slam decider at Murrayfield, and a year later in Cardiff when both teams managed to avoid defeat.</p><p>The theory then was that with Wales and Ireland locked in a downward spiral, playing the other at home was a rare occurrence of being installed as favourites and both sides struggled to cope with the unaccustomed pressure.</p><p>That is hardly the case now. If the fixture has provided more home victories in the Six Nations era than it did in the last 17 of the old Five Nations, the advantage is still with the away team, 8-6. Ireland recorded their third consecutive victory in Cardiff last year, while Wales won in Dublin in 2008 and 2012 on their way to grand slams.</p><p>The Wales head coach Warren Gatland has this month been encouraging his players to think like champions and expect to win matches home and away, a far cry from the days when his charges were allergic to favouritism.</p><p></p><h2>HEINEKEN CUP STILL IN MUDDY WATERS</h2><p></p><p>Every time there is a meeting over the future of the European Cup, the picture seems to become even less clear.</p><p>The Six Nations will meet again next Wednesday, together with the French and English clubs and the Welsh regions, after talks this week that were said to have crawled a few centimetres towards a solution acceptable to all.</p><p>The issues of governance and the television contract are the obstacles to a settlement, together with the dispute between the Welsh Rugby Union and the Ospreys, Llanelli Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Newport Gwent Dragons over control and finance which has frustrated, rather than facilitated, progress.</p><p>Another complication is last week's decision of the Heineken Cup organisers, European Rugby Cup Ltd, to hold back the latest instalment of participation money due to the teams from the six countries that take part in the tournament and the Amlin Challenge Cup, some €8m.</p><p>As things stand, there is unlikely to be a Heineken Cup next season and so no ERC. It has reserves of some €2.5m and needs to ensure that if it ceases trading, it has enough money to not only pay off staff but meet liabilities: the television contract extension it signed with Sky in 2012 is potentially one.</p><p>The ERC board met this week and agreed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/06/english-welsh-erc-payments-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">defer a decision about whether to pay the instalment until 19 February</a>. If it vacillates again then, or decides to retain the money – two other instalments are due before the end of the season – the Welsh regions, who had to make provisions to cover their wage bills at the end of last month, will feel the loss even more keenly.</p><p>The regions have vacated their seat on the ERC board and did not attend Wednesday's ERC meeting, making it clear that their vote was not to be appropriated by the WRU. One of the reasons for staying away was that they wanted the union to be arguing their case.</p><p>The regions are suspicious of why the money has not be released, so far keeping their opinions to themselves. They have suspended talks with the WRU over a new participation agreement until ERC makes payment, although the two sides continue to do battle in the media.</p><p>The WRU claimed this week that the two sides were working constructively to reach an agreement over central contracts but they are a considerable way apart: the union is talking about five or six while the regions say the policy should be part of a joined-up approach covering the game at all levels.</p><p>Three of the Wales squad who are out of contract at the end of the season continue to be wooed by their regions and the WRU. The centre Scott Williams, a try scorer against Italy last weekend, is believed to be ready to sign an extension with the Scarlets before leaving for Saturday's match in Dublin.</p><p>That leaves the Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland, who has turned down an offer from Gloucester, and the Ospreys prop Adam Jones, whose offer from the union, around £250,000 a year, is better than that tabled by his region.</p><p>Premiership Rugby was guardedly optimistic this week that a six-nation solution to the European Cup could be found but it has condemned the ERC decision to defer a decision on payment, saying it could be a deal-breaker. It is already working on two models next season: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/03/premiership-rugby-wales-regions-anglo-welsh-league\" title=\"\">one which includes Europe and one based on an Anglo-Welsh league with the regions</a>.</p><p>The English clubs and the regions are as one over Europe.

New life has been breathed into the career of Manny Pacquiao. Heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko glowers at the horizon, unthreatened. Bernard Hopkins still fights at a high level. Miguel Cotto remains one of boxing's biggest attactions; Sergio Martinez holds the middleweight championship by a thread. </p><p>These are good days for fighters aged over 30, so much so that even some of boxing's up-and-comers, such as Gennady Golovkin and light heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson, are into their third decade. But here is a list of the young men who might quest upwards – in marketability, ring esteem or both – in 2014. </p><p>What follows is not a list of prospects poised for success in 2014. This is a list of boxers aged 30 and below who have established themselves as no worse than contenders, hence the absence of blue-chippers such as Felix Verdejo and Anthony Joshua. Some of the boxers on this list didn't enjoy a great year <a href=\"http://www.queensberry-rules.com/year/january/a-list-of-young-boxers-who-could-be-on-the-rise-in-the-united-states-in-2013-part-ii.html\">in 2013</a>, but could recover in the coming months. It is inevitably incomplete, so your suggestions in the comments section are welcome.</p><h2>The top tier</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429062253'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1379014964515/boxer-saul-Canelo-Alvarez-008.jpg' alt='boxer saul Canelo Alvarez' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Saúl 'Canelo' Alvarez. Photograph: J Emilio Floris/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Saúl Álvarez, junior middleweight, 23</strong></p><p><strong>Upside:</strong> Canelo finally proved himself against Austin Trout in 2013, which made it hard to dismiss him as a red-headed Mexican hype-job who was skating by on his good looks. Some thought Trout deserved the victory, but Canelo showed some authentic boxing ability. He did it in front of the biggest live audience for any US boxing event of the year. Then he got to a whole new level of exposure in the year's biggest pay-per-view fight, which doubled as one of the two biggest PPVs ever. Now Golden Boy Promotions is trying to establish him as its next PPV star, starting with what many expect to be a fan-friendly bout against Alfredo Angulo. And he's still just 23 years old.</p><p><strong>Downside:</strong> Floyd Mayweather, Jr. makes everyone miserable, but Canelo was particularly hopeless, not the last impression you want to leave if you're hoping to get people to buy your next fight. And that \"three PPVs in 2013\" idea will shrink his television audience rather than expand it. Not only are their still questions about how good he is, but he isn't the most energetic performer in the ring. So far, the segment of the Mexican fan base that hates pretty boys and cheers machismo hasn't inhibited his ability to sell tickets or deliver huge TV ratings, although it could bite him if he loses a few.</p><p><strong>Timothy Bradley, welterweight, 30</strong></p><p><strong>Upside:</strong> After languishing for years as a top talent with no clear fanbase, then getting blowback for a disputed-decision win against Manny Pacquiao that wasn't his fault, 2013 marked Bradley's breakthrough. First came the unexpectedly thrilling war with Ruslan Provodnikov, then came the chess-match win over one of boxing's best, Juan Manuel Márquez. After he beat Márquez, he declared himself one of the top three fighters in the sport, behind Mayweather and Andre Ward, and it wasn't empty bragging. He's eloquent, he has a charismatic intensity, he can make a fight as fun as he chooses and he's damn good. And in 2014, he'll get a rematch with Pacquiao, a fight many now think he can win. If he does, he can siphon off some of Pacquiao's stardom.</p><p><strong>Downside:</strong> Somehow, he keeps getting booed at the end of his fights – some thought Provodnikov won; some were Mexican – so clearly he hasn't quite won over all of the fans. Nor has he really established that clear fanbase; he is not a proven draw as an A-side, and despite tons of coverage from his hometown paper he hasn't developed any regional following in southern California, while African-American fans haven't massively mobilised behind any black fighters not named Mayweather in recent years. Losing to Pacquiao wouldn't hurt him much because he should still come in as the betting underdog, but it could ding the appeal of a rematch with Márquez or Provodnikov. Certainly he'd be better off beating Pacquiao.</p><p><strong>Danny Garcia, junior welterweight, 25</strong></p><p><strong>Upside:</strong> Garcia also had a banner 2013, a Fighter of the Year-worthy campaign just like Bradley's, winning <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/\">the real junior welterweight championship</a> against Lucas Matthysse on the undercard of Canelo-Mayweather and beating a still-vital version of Zab Judah in front of a big crowd in New York. The Matthysse performance was a revelation. It's not that no one thought Garcia could beat Matthysse so much as few saw him defanging the fearsome puncher so comprehensively. He arrived in the pound-for-pound top 10 in some quarters, setting himself up as arguably the most viable Mayweather opponent in 2014. He has a natural constituency among Philadelphians and Puerto Ricans.</p><p><strong>Downside:</strong> Perhaps we should start with his clothes, which are comedy fodder on social media. Or his music, which serves the same purpose. It's superficial, to be sure, but one of the last things you want to do as a fighter is to become a laughing stock to boxing fans, because they can converge on you in a grueling fashion that damages your marketability. Then there's the matter of Garcia's father/trainer, whose racial diatribes come at the rate of one every other week, a new ethnic group or nationality every time. And while he's stayed clear of the most offensive stuff himself, Danny did recently suggest on Twitter that Justin Bieber's drunk driving was no big deal. Maybe Garcia can seize on some of this family offensiveness to play the villain, a profitable role for the likes of Mayweather and Adrien Broner, but it doesn't feel planned.</p><p><strong>Mikey Garcia, junior lightweight, 26</strong></p><p><strong>Upside:</strong> Few young fighters flash as much talent, technique and composure as Garcia, who methodically mows down all opposition, even scoring knockouts as he began to step up to the level of contender. He has real power (28 knockouts in 34 wins), having jumped from featherweight to junior lightweight and stopping Rocky Martínez in 2013 – something nobody had done before, and Martínez had faced some hard punchers. Right now, he's getting a big push from Top Rank, who keep mentioning him as a future opponent for Pacquiao. It might be a ploy, but that they're giving him such a push at all means they are high on him. If he fights Yuriorkis Gamboa next, it'll be a big event.</p><p><strong>Downside:</strong> That word \"methodically\" doesn't do him favours. He heard some boos during his last fight against Juan Carlos Burgos. For all the push they're giving him, Top Rank keeps putting him on the East Coast, a situation they're correcting with his next fight planned nearer to his West Coast base (which could also help him connect more with his Mexican-American compatriots). Also, as solidly as he has finished his two fights at junior lightweight, it has been disconcerting for his prospects at higher weights to see him get shaken by both Burgos and Martinez early on in those fights.</p><p><strong>Andre Ward, super middleweight, 29</strong></p><p><strong>Upside:</strong> The previous Fighter of the Year in 2012, Ward is still one of the two best active fighters alive alongside Mayweather. He is still the last Olympic gold medalist from the US. He still has a deal with Nike – an appearance in one of their commercials was a 2013 highlight – and he still appeals to purists who love watching him pick apart top 10 contenders like flies. He still has a commentating gig on HBO, which keeps him in the spotlight. He still is one of the better regional ticketsellers in the US when he sets up shop in Oakland.</p><p><strong>Downside:</strong> Why all the \"stills?\" Because with the kind of year Ward had in 2013, it's easy to forget what kind of tools he has in the ring and outside it. The HBO gig hasn't exactly ingratiated him to all the network's viewers. As composed as he is, he's prone to weird flubs like criticising Carl Froch for wanting to fight Julio César Chávez, Jr. when Ward had earlier said he wanted the same thing. He can't stop suing his promoter, Dan Goossen, which along with an injury and choosiness over his fall opponent kept him largely on the sidelines in 2013. He didn't do the kind of ticket sales or TV ratings in 2013 that he did in 2012, for a variety of reasons – and the biggest impediment to him growing in 2014 remains a style that is anathema to the all-action crowd. He might get a big fight in 2014 – Chávez, Froch, Gennady Golovkin – and that could help his commercial and competitive potential.</p><h2>The second tier</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429062254'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/2/17/1361139940341/Adrien-Broner-Gavin-Rees-008.jpg' alt='Adrien Broner, Gavin Rees' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adrien Broner on his way to victory over Gavin Rees in their WBC lightweight title clash in Atlantic City. Photograph: Tim Larsen/AP</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Adrien Broner, welterweight, 24</strong></p><p>You worry about his work habits, whether he's really a welterweight after that loss to Marcos Maidana and if he'll be in jail at any point in 2014, but until proven otherwise, he's one of the biggest ratings attractions in boxing. Half of his viewers want to watch him get beaten up, and maybe they'll not tune in to such a degree now that he has been. But if he avenges the loss to Maidana, he'll have restored some of his lustre as one of the brighter young talents in the sport.</p><p><strong>Julio César Chávez, Jr., super middleweight, 26</strong></p><p>We're only one fight removed from the days of Chávez as must-see TV, when he nearly stopped middleweight champion Sergio Martínez in a fight Martínez was dominating. Even then there were questions about his work habits, but they went to a new level as he repeatedly rescheduled his fight with Bryan Vera and kept asking for higher weight limits. Then once he got into the ring, the fans didn't come out in the usual numbers, and he didn't perform well in what should have been a loss. The facts remain: he has that name, he has Mexico, and a ton of people were around their TV sets for the Vera fight. Don't count on him finding discipline beyond the Vera rematch, but Golovkin, Chávez or Froch could be around the corner for him in big bouts, possibly (unfortunately) on PPV.</p><p><strong>Terence Crawford, lightweight, 26</strong></p><p>As the man holding the title of \"best American fighter in waiting\", Crawford has to be in this tier, despite a cautious style that doesn't appeal to every fan. Ward, Bradley and a few others once held the title and the \"despites\" haven't always held them back. He'll get his big chance to prove himself against Ricky Burns in his next fight, although the bout not being televised on HBO is confusing; he was getting a push from the network but then they said no to his biggest fight. It doesn't feel like a breakup yet, but if it is, Crawford will be without his biggest platform and hurting.</p><p><strong>Juan Francisco Estrada, flyweight, 23</strong></p><p>If Estrada was 20 pounds heavier, he'd be a staple on HBO or Showtime by now. He's exciting and talented: an elusive combination. He has proven himself against the best of the lower weight classes (a close loss to Román González, wins over Brian Viloria and Milan Melindo) and could be poised for all kinds of competitive action fights in 2014, like Giovanni Segura or Viloria and González again. We could be talking about a pound-for-pound top-10 fighter by year's end, if he wins them all. But yeah, being a flyweight hurts him a lot.</p><p><strong>Carl Frampton, junior featherweight, 26</strong></p><p>If you're packing them in to the tune of 8,000 or so at age 26 – as Frampton did twice in 2013 in Belfast – you're off to a helluva start. When one of the bouts is one of the most impressive wins of 2013, a knockout of the rock-hard Kiko Martínez (who himself had a very impressive win in 2013, over Jhonatan Romero), you're cooking with gas. And should Frampton beat Hugo Cázares, as he ought to, then he could be in line to face Léo Santa Cruz. With his style, given his ability to both box and punch and Santa Cruz's problems with the former, he'd be a popular pick to win.</p><p><strong>Román González, flyweight, 26</strong></p><p>Everything that goes for Estrada goes for González (exciting, talented, 20 pounds heavier and he's an HBO/Showtime staple, the right break and he's in the pound-for-pound top 10), only González is significantly more accomplished overall – heck, he beat Estrada. An Estrada rematch could be up in 2014, and if ever there was a \"little man\" fight for the big networks to care about, it would be this one. I don't imagine they will, but it's a formula for González to rise in the ring, at least.</p><p><strong>Sergey Kovalev, light heavyweight, 30</strong></p><p>Kovalev just narrowly missed the top tier. Anytime your name is one half of arguably the most desirable fight in the whole sport – Kovalev-Adonis Stevenson – you are in a position for big stardom. Kovalev could take the light heavyweight championship from Stevenson in 2014 in a meeting of two of boxing's biggest punchers. That punching power is, of course, a huge element of Kovalev's appeal. The only reason he didn't make the top tier is because, for all the love he gets from HBO, he hasn't yet proven himself a draw. But on ability, aesthetics, personality (he's funny!) and potential to make it really big in 2014, he's right there.</p><p><strong>Ruslan Provodnikov, junior welterweight, 30</strong></p><p>What a 2013 for Provodnikov, who graduated from ESPN2 Friday Night Fights fan-favorite to legitimate threat, first by rattling Bradley to the core of his being and then by knocking off Mike Alvarado coming off the win of his career. Now he might be in line for a shot at Pacquiao, Márquez or Bradley again. Can he beat any of them? He wouldn't be most folks' pick, but then, he wasn't against Alvarado either. Provodnikov is for real, and he's really fun to watch. A win over one member of that trio would vault him into full-on stardom as opposed to the cult version he has at this moment, where even his mother is revered on soclal media.</p><p><strong>Léo Santa Cruz, junior featherweight, 25</strong></p><p>The mini Antonio Margarito sometimes looks a certified killer, but he occasionally struggles with anyone who doesn't stand right in front of him and get punched. Like the larger version of himself, he never stops throwing punches with his long arms and never much cares how much he is hit back – although he's probably a little less powerful and a little better on defense. Beating Cristian Mijares would help his reputation for struggling with slicksters, and beating Frampton would confirm he's a handful for anyone, even the bigger names at 126 like Abner Mares or Jhonny González.</p><p><strong>Keith Thurman, welterweight, 25</strong></p><p>With his big power and his loquacious interview antics, Thurman is always a good time. He's dangerous, too, to almost anyone in a loaded division, and this year could be the one when he gets a serious contender, such as Shawn Porter. About the only knocks on him are that he's unproven, which obviously can change, and he's from the non-hotbed of boxing known as the state of Florida. If all breaks right for him in 2014, we could be looking at a viable Mayweather opponent in 2015.</p><p><strong>Deontay Wilder, heavyweight, 28</strong></p><p>He's sloppy at times, but is there anyone else with a better chance of knocking out heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko with one punch? His size, speed and his devastating right hand could be a real threat to Wlad by year's end, if he steadily steps up the competition as he has with his first scheduled opponent of 2014, Malik Scott, and bests it. Then we would be talking about a massive star. It's all very speculative, but the payoff is enormous.</p><h2>Honourable mentions</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429062255'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390595701501/Carl-Froch-and-George-Gro-011.jpg' alt='Carl Froch and George Groves during their world super-middleweight title fight in November.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>George Groves during his world super-middleweight title fight against Carl Froch. Photograph: Tom Jenkins</figcaption></figure><p><strong>George Groves, super middleweight, 25</strong></p><p>If Groves' bout with Froch had only counted through five rounds, we would be talking about Groves as a major future talent to watch. As it is, \"the enemy has a vote\", and Froch voted in typical Froch style to surge back into contention. Groves lost unfairly on a poor stoppage, and might have lost anyway, but as much as the ending cast doubt on Groves' ceiling, he moves UK audiences and could get Ward next.</p><p><strong>Kell Brook, welterweight, 27</strong></p><p>Shaky sometimes, stellar others, Brook has a load of talent and is poised to use it in 2014 against Shawn Porter – assuming he doesn't pull out injured.</p><p><strong>Jermell and Jermall Charlo, junior middleweight, 23</strong></p><p>The men known as #twincharlo on Twitter are exceptionally skilled boxers, prospects vying for contender status. Jermell just proved himself as a contender against Gabriel Rosado, while Jermall has a chance to do same against Carlos Molina soon. Ring aesthetics are a negative, though.</p><p><strong>Omar Figueroa, lightweight, 24</strong></p><p>He hasn't exactly faced anyone who could be considered a contender yet, but Figueroa has established himself as a big deal in the state of Texas and his bona fides as a warrior were firmly entrenched by his even-watching-it-hurt battle with Nihito Arakawa.</p><p><strong>Yoan Pablo Hernandez, cruiserweight, 29</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Germany-based Cuban is a world-beater. Other times, he gets taken to the brink by lesser fighters. But he's the present and future of cruiserweight with Marco Huck wanting to chase bigger game at heavyweight.</p><p><strong>Kazute Ioka, junior flyweight, 24</strong></p><p>He's fun. He's young. He's good. He's small. Three of those four work for him. He might not have been ready for the likes of González in 2013, but it might not be much longer.</p><p><strong>Erislandy Lara, junior middleweight, 30</strong></p><p>For a significant contingent of boxing fandom, Lara is the biggest viable, conceivable competitive threat to Mayweather. Too bad his promoter, Golden Boy, isn't a big fan, and too bad his contemplative style turns off a great many other non-fans.</p><p><strong>James Kirkland, junior middleweight, 29</strong></p><p>So long as the Texan isn't in jail and is spending his free time with trainer Ann Wolfe, there is no more visceral a fighter than Kirkland, and that's the kind of fighter who can get the adrenaline pumping. There's no guarantee of either, and a middleweight move to face Golovkin could be disastrous.</p><p><strong>Vasyl Lomachenko, featherweight, 25</strong></p><p>When was the last time a one-fight prospect was the betting favourite against a top-10 contender? Yet Lomachenko, a decorated amateur, could be just that against Orlando Salido in his next fight, so significant is his ability and Olympic pedigree.</p><p><strong>Jessie Magdaleno, junior featherweight, 22</strong></p><p>The greenest prospect on this list, Magdaleno has been blowing through the competition in a bloody fashion. He might be a better candidate for this list in 2015, but he's an early pick for Prospect of the Year in 2014, and that's worth something.</p><p><strong>Marcos Maidana, welterweight, 30</strong></p><p>No, it's not fair for Maidana to be in this tier when the man he beat in his last fight is in the one above. It's because he can't draw the same kind of ratings as Broner. But if Maidana can beat Broner a second time, we'll be saying his name as a Mayweather opponent, so it's a good consolation prize.</p><p><strong>Abner Mares, featherweight, 28</strong></p><p>It wasn't so long ago that Mares was a top-10 p4per. A 1st round knockout loss can change things pretty quickly. But you can't ignore what Mares accomplished prior to the Gonzalez loss when considering his future.</p><p><strong>Lamont Peterson, junior welterweight, 30</strong></p><p>Perceived by many as just a notch below elite, Peterson nonetheless commands a quality fight town in Washington, DC, and has given elite talents other than Matthysse everything they could handle. He's also never in a bad fight.</p><p><strong>Peter Quillin, middleweight, 30</strong></p><p>Is Quillin, with his speed and power, the biggest threat to Golovkin at 160? We might never find out, given the divide between the two networks upon which they fight. But Quillin could challenge Golovkin as the top contender to champion Martínez with wins in 2014 over Curtis Stevens and Danny Jacobs.</p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.queensberry-rules.com/\">This article first appeared on The Queensberry Rules</a><br />• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tqbr\">Follow The Queensberry Rules on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p>","headline":"The 30 young boxers on the rise in 2014","trailText":"<p><strong>The Queensberry Rules:</strong> From Floyd Mayweather to Sergio Martínez, so many of boxing's best fighters are approaching middle-age, but here are the fighters aged 30 or under who could become contenders in 2014</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mff7","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/1/30/1296383579180/Devon-Alexander-Timothy-B-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/1/30/1296383579180/Devon-Alexander-Timothy-B-003.jpg","wordcount":"3289","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428984021","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tim Starks for <a href=\"http://www.queensberry-rules.com/\" title=\"\"> The Queensberry Rules</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Sport Network</a>","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038696","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:39:56Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2014/feb/06/30-young-boxers-on-rise-in-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2014/feb/06/30-young-boxers-on-rise-in-2014","tags":[{"id":"sport/boxing","webTitle":"Boxing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/boxing","references":[]},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/series/guardian-sport-network","webTitle":"Guardian Sport Network","type":"series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network","references":[]},{"id":"sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog","webTitle":"The Queensberry rules","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tim-starks","webTitle":"Tim Starks","r2ContributorId":"52317","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tim Starks is the founder and editor of <a href=\"http://queensberry-rules.com/\">The Queensberry Rules</a>, dubbed an \"indispensable boxing blog\" by The Wall Street Journal and \"the best boxing blog out there\" by Gawker.

That makes it difficult to believe the assurances, from the new chief executive Robbie Paul among others, that more players will not be offloaded to follow stalwarts of last year's team such as Keith Lulia and Heath L'Estrange. Cummins is a tough, intelligent coach who has made a couple of decent signings, but survival is their most realistic goal, and would be a decent achievement.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 12th</p><h2>Castleford Tigers</h2><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 12th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Daryl Powell</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Michael Shenton</p><p>Rangi Chase has been the most consistently watchable player in the Super League for the last three seasons, and has set up a high proportion of Castleford's tries, so his departure for Salford would seem to leave the Tigers in trouble. But they were already showing promising signs of recovery in the second half of 2013 after Powell replaced Ian Millward, and the former Great Britain stand-off has made a series of sound signings in his own low-profile, common-sense image. Andy Lynch, Liam Finn and Marc Sneyd are classic examples, and the latter two could form an effective half-back partnership. Brett Seymour, an Australian who left Hull under a cloud last season, must be more of a risk.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 8th</p><h2>Catalan Dragons</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>7th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Laurent Frayssinous</p><p><strong>Captains: </strong>Greg Mounis / Jason Baitieri</p><p>This will be the ninth Super League season for the Perpignan-based club who have added so much to the competition, not least their ability to attract high-calibre overseas imports, with this year's new recruit, Ben Pomeroy, a centre from Cronulla, maintaining that trend. Jeff Lima, who has joined from South Sydney, has always been a thoroughly unpleasant opponent, whether playing for Melbourne or Wigan, so he should also stiffen their pack. But Remi Casty, the France captain who has gone in the opposite direction to join the former Catalans coach Trent Robinson at the Sydney Roosters, will be a huge loss.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 9th</p><h2>Huddersfield Giants</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>1st (but lost in play-off semi finals)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Paul Anderson</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Danny Brough</p><p>Plenty of motivation, after a memorable season, in which Huddersfield finished on top of the table for the first time in decades, ended in the disappointment of defeat one match short of Old Trafford. The squad is mostly intact, with a sprinkling of new additions of whom Jodie Broughton, a real flier from Salford, is the most enticing. They will lose the element of surprise they enjoyed last year, and remain heavily reliant on the brilliant Brough, but should be challenging again.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 3rd</p><h2>Hull FC</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>6th (lost in play-offs)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Lee Radford</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Gareth Ellis</p><p>The appointment of Radford, an uncompromising local lad who was a key figure in the dominant Bradford Bulls pack, seemed a thoroughly sensible move by the owner Adam Pearson, as he seeks to end decades of underachievement and build lasting success on the model that has been followed by Ian Lenagan at Wigan. But the early signs are that this could be a long-term job, as Radford has inherited some dodgy Australians on expensive long-term contracts. Ellis's recent injury problems are also a major worry.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 11th</p><h2>Hull KR</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>8th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Craig Sandercock</p><p><strong>Captains: </strong>Travis Burns and Josh Hodgson</p><p>The general view is that Rovers will struggle to replace Michael Dobson, and of course the departure of one of the competition's most quietly influential overseas imports in recent years has been a challenge. But Burns showed enough alongside Dobson last year to suggest that he will ease the blow, if he can avoid injury and suspension, and hopes are high for his half-back partnership with Kris Keating, one of several new signings with a solid pedigree in the NRL. They could easily cause a few surprises.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 7th</p><h2>Leeds Rhinos</h2><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 3rd (lost in play-off semi finals)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Brian McDermott</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Kevin Sinfield</p><p>The Rhinos are not used to spending the winter reflecting on a season without a trophy, but that isn't the main reason they look so formidable this year. It's the firepower they have in the three-quarters, with six players – Zak Hardaker, Ryan Hall, Ben Jones-Bishop, Kallum Watkins, Joel Moon and the new signing Tom Briscoe – jostling for five places, that should make them as irresistible as they are watchable, especially when the weather improves. McDermott also high hopes of a new generation of players in more central positions breathing down the necks of the Sinfield-Burrow-McGuire triangle, led by the tall stand-off Liam Sutcliffe, and the Papua New Guinea hooker Paul Aiton will offer a fresh dimension around the rucks.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 1st and Grand Final winners</p><h2>London Broncos</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>13th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Tony Rea</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Matt Cook</p><p>Somehow survived the winter to start a 19th Super League season, thanks to fresh interest from the Barnet FC owner Anthony Kleanthous, which has led to another move, from The Twickenham Stoop to The Edgware Hive. But it will a major surprise if it proves any more than a 12-month stay of execution. The squad that struggled last year has been further depleted as key players departed during the months of uncertainty, leaving Rea and his assistant Sean Long scrambling for experienced replacements to look after the southern youngsters who were thrown in at the deep end last year.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 14th</p><h2>Salford Red Devils</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>14th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Brian Noble</p><p>The story of the pre-season, as Dr Marwan Koukash, their wealthy owner from the Middle East, has flashed loadsamoney with all the restrained class of the Harry Enfield character. It's certainly generated publicity for a club who have generally been one of Super League's also-rans, at best, and a team including Rangi Chase, Tim Smith, Gareth Hock, Harrison Hansen, Adrian Morley and Martin Gleeson, coached by the vastly-experienced Brian Noble, is not to be sniffed at. It also has the potential to go spectacularly wrong, but with three of their first four fixtures against Wakefield, London and Widnes, the Devils have a real chance to build some momentum.</p><p><strong>Prediction: </strong>6th</p><h2>St Helens</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>5th (lost in play-off semi finals)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Nathan Brown</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Paul Wellens</p><p>Big things are expected of the Saints this year, and will be demanded of Brown after a patchy first season in charge by the chairman Eamonn McManus. After several seasons struggling to develop a new half-back to fill the big boots of Sean Long, they have recruited one from Australia – Luke Walsh, who arrives from Penrith with a decent reputation, especially for his kicking game. Mose Masoe, a hulking Samoan who made a big impression in the World Cup, also seems likely to make an impact, although he will miss the start of the season through injury and may need to modify his tackling technique to avoid regular suspension.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 4th</p><h2>Wakefield Trinity</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>11th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Richard Agar</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Danny Kirmond</p><p>Agar has had to rebuild significantly for the second time in three winters after another Trinity regime turned out to have been living beyond their means, and that has led to the departure of key figures such as Smith for Salford, Aiton for Leeds and Ben Cockayne back to Hull KR. But keeping Kirmond, a tireless second-row who was considered unlucky to miss out on England's World Cup squad by many good judges, gives them at least a fighting chance of defying the odds again. Agar is a canny operator, Paul McShane is a good-value replacement for Aiton, but it's a worry when overseas signings are still waiting for visas.</p><p><strong>Prediction: </strong>13th</p><h2>Warrington Wolves</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>2nd (lost Grand Final)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Tony Smith</p><p><strong>Captains: </strong>Ben Westwood, Michael Monaghan</p><p>There is a plausible theory that the Wolves have missed their best chance to win a first Super League title with consecutive Grand Final defeats, especially now that their long-term playmaker Lee Briers has been forced to retire. Morley and Brett Hodgson have also gone, the elder Monaghan brother is knocking on, and new signing Roy Asotasi is no spring chicken. But Smith has been quietly refreshing his squad in key positions for a couple of years now, signing Richie Myler and Stefan Ratchford from Salford, and introducing Ben Currie and Glenn Riley to the team. They should challenge again.</p><p><strong>Prediction: </strong>2nd</p><h2>Widnes Vikings</h2><p><strong>Last season: </strong>10th</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Denis Betts</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Kevin Brown</p><p>Steady, sustainable improvement has been Betts's mantra since he returned to league from Gloucester and Widnes returned to the Super League, and he has again gone for quality rather than quantity in his recruitment by signing Danny Tickle and the under-rated Paul Johnson from Hull. Hock's departure for Salford robs them of an x-factor, even if it was occasionally x-rated, but if Brown stays fit, his half-back partnership with the excellent Joe Mellor will be hard to handle, and well worth watching.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 10th</p><h2>Wigan Warriors</h2><p><strong>Last season:</strong> Champions (Grand Final winners, after finishing 4th)</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>Shaun Wane</p><p><strong>Captain: </strong>Sean O'Loughlin</p><p>Wane's safety-first structure, his no-excuse culture and the commitment and aggression of his teams allowed Wigan to prosper last season despite the loss of key figures from previous years, such as Brett Finch and Thomas Leuluai. But this winter two more senior men have headed down under – Sam Tomkins is irreplaceable, and Lee Mossop not far off. In addition, they are heading for Sydney after Friday night's opener against Huddersfield to take on the mighty Roosters, a draining trip whatever happens that must take its toll later in the year. However Wane will already be working on ensuring a reshaped squad, in which John Bateman and Dan Sarginson shape as especially shrewd acquisitions, is refreshed to peak again from August to October.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 5th</p>","headline":"Super League 2014: team-by-team guide","trailText":"<p><strong>Andy Wilson: </strong>Can Wigan retain their title?

We have some standing water and we will have to miss out a hurdle, bypass a fence and use the temporary two-mile start. However, there is a lot of rain forecast so we will have a look. We could get between five and 15 millimetres tonight and then more rain Friday into Saturday. We need a lot of luck.\"</p><p>Friday's meetings at Bangor and Newcastle have both been called off due to waterlogged tracks.</p><p>Bangor clerk of the course Andrew Morris said: \"We had 20 millimetres of rain in the last 24 hours and it was a simple decision to abandon. We were just fit to race yesterday morning but the further rain means we aren't fit now and there is more forecast.\"</p><p>Newcastle's clerk of the course James Armstrong inspected the venue on Thursday morning but following further overnight rain, he had no alternative but to call off the meeting.</p><p>He said: \"We had eight millimetres of rain overnight and there's been a heavy drizzle all this morning. We are due another 4-7mm tonight and another 3-4mm tomorrow. The track is waterlogged, it is the same areas as last time we abandoned that are effected and we can't avoid them.\"</p><p></p><h2>Thursday's best bets, by Tony Paley</h2><p></p><p>With the ground in a desperate state at the turf venues presently the best option might be to look to the all-weather for the safest wagers and <strong>Crisis Averted (7.00)</strong> appeals at Wolverhampton tonight. The Richard Fahey-trained runner is sure to improve for his win over course and distance and shoudl be a fair price in this competitive heat.</p><p></p><p>Huntingdon got the go-ahead this morning but looks a tricky card and for a bet over the jumps the best suggestion is at Doncaster where <strong>Vaniteux (1.50)</strong> should go well in the novice hurdle for Nicky Henderson.

One of those is the National Hunt Chase (aka the 'Four-Miler') following three significant alterations to the race conditions in 2002, 2006 and 2010 leading to a superior class of horse required these days required to win these days. The last three winners, for example, had all contested a Grade 1 novice chase earlier in the season and were officially top rated. Favourites used to have an awful record but have now won three of the last four runnings since penalties were dispensed with.</p><p></p><p>This could not be have been better illustrated last season than when the officially top-rated Back In Focus (150) beat the officially second top-rated Tofino Bay by half a length. In fact, the last three winners were officially the best novice chaser entering the race rated 151, 146 and 150. Compare that to the nine years up to and including 2009 since the race conditions alterations were no winners were officially rated higher than 140 heading into the contest and we can see just what a different race this is these days.</p><p></p><p><em>Paul Jones will provide a stat of the day, Monday to Friday, from now to the week before the Festival.</em></p><p></p><p>Click <a href=\"http://www.weatherbysshop.co.uk/betting-services/jump-racing/cheltenham-festival-betting-guide-2014\" title=\"\">here</a> to order the Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide published by Weatherbys</p><p></p><h2>Stan James tipping competition - day four</h2><p></p><p>Overnight leaders Ellandback (now +17.25) and Moidadem (+15) both had 6-4 shot Cabuchon yesterday, with Ellandback also finding 1-4 shot Like A Prayer, and are still out in front with two days to go.</p><p></p><p>This week's prize is a £25 ante-post bet on any race at the Cheltenham Festival, kindly offered by Stan James!</p><p></p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>2.15 Huntingdon, 3.00 Doncaster and 3.35 Doncaster</strong>.</p><p></p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday.

condition.<br> </p><p>In the wake of the supplements scandal that engulfed Essendon in 2013 and led to the club being banned from the finals series, the league has also changed its anti-doping code to allow the AFL to conduct its own sample collections for intelligence purposes.<br> </p><p>This measure exceeds the requirements of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code.<br> </p><p>\"No substance is to be administered to any player by injection other than by an appropriately qualified medical practitioner and only to the extent it is necessary to treat a legitimate medical condition,\" the AFL said in a statement.<br> </p><p>\"No person may possess needles or injectables other than the club medical officer.\"<br> </p><p>Clubs will be permitted to use controlled treatments but they must be approved by the club doctor and recorded in a register made available to the league.<br> </p><p>The league's charge sheet against Essendon in August 2013 stated that if the Bombers supplements program had continued as planned, 26,000 injections would have been administered to players.</p><p>Leading sports doctor Peter Larkins said it was totally inappropriate that anyone other than a qualified club doctor would administer injections to players.<br> </p><p>\"Over the past year, there have been too many cases where medical decisions relating to player health and wellbeing have been made by some with no clinical qualifications and without medical consultation,\" he said.<br> </p><p>\"The concept of medical decisions being made by non-medical personnel is fraught with danger and poses serious risks to the health and wellbeing of the player, particularly in relation to issues such as injury management and nutrition supplementation.<br> </p><p>\"The AFL's new code takes us back to what should have always been the acceptable practice in regards to injection of substances.\"<br> </p><p>Sports Medicine Australia chief executive Nello Marino said the best way to protect the integrity of the AFL was to ensure all medical decisions on player health were made in consultation with the club doctor.<br> </p><p>\"Over the past year, we have become increasingly concerned by the apparent marginalisation and undermining of authority of club doctors within professional sport,\" Marino said.</p><p>Gambling on all Australian football competitions by AFL players and officials has also been banned.<br> </p><p>All players, coaches and assistants, as well as members of match committees have been put on notice that they must at all times perform on their merits.<br> </p><p>Mobile phone use will be restricted in change rooms and coaches' boxes on game days and all club employees must be registered.<br> </p><p>Homicide squad detective and former Carlton reserves player Tony Keane has joined a beefed-up AFL integrity department as an investigator.<br> </p><p>Keane will report to senior investigator Gerard Ryan.<br> </p><p>\"The appointment of these two highly experienced investigators to join our specialist intelligence analysts underlines the commitment of the AFL to continue our proactive stance to counter the emerging integrity risks that face all sports in Australia,\" AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon said.<br> </p><p>\"Following the establishment of the integrity unit in 2008, the AFL is determined to remain at the forefront of work to protect the integrity of the game and to keep our players and officials safe from the threats of doping, corruption and organised crime.\"</p><br>","headline":"AFL bans injections for anything except medical

It succeeded only in sparking anger at Liverpool, with the club's owner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/08/luis-suarez-liverpool-john-w-henry\" title=\"\">John W Henry, saying, in a tweet: \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\"</a></p><p>Wenger subsequently admitted that the bid did look provocative and was \"not the most subtle thing we have done.\"</p><p>Suárez has reapplied himself at Anfield and he has been arguably the Premier League's player of the season so far, with 23 goals in 19 appearances. Although Wenger highlighted Liverpool's various offensive threats, it was clear that Suárez was the player that he wanted to stop.</p><p>\"No, there are no regrets,\" Wenger said. \"You have sometimes regrets when a player played for you, and scores goals or does well somewhere else [but] he was never our player. It is just a situation that did not come off and that is it.\"</p><p>Wenger, who insisted that it had not been his intention to replace Olivier Giroud with Suárez, was asked whether he might try again for the Uruguayan in the summer. \"At the moment, no,\" he replied.</p><p>\"For us, the important thing is to win the game,\" Wenger added. \"The fact about what happened in the summer [with Suárez] is nothing to do with that. If you want to win the game, what is for sure is that he's one of the players that you have to keep quiet.</p><p>\"Liverpool have a strong offensive force with [Daniel] Sturridge, with Suárez, with [Philippe] Coutinho, with [Raheem] Sterling behind. All these players can score goals and make a difference. What you want on our side is a strong defensive performance and to dominate, to leave them as few balls as possible. The philosophy on our side has to be the same: to master the ball and to dominate the game.\"</p><p>Arsenal travel to Merseyside on top of the table, two points clear of Manchester City and Chelsea, after the latter's win at the Etihad Stadium on Monday night. City had entered the game as the favourites but Chelsea's 1-0 victory provided the latest twist in a tight championship race.</p><p>\"I told you one month ago and you did not believe me ... there is no invincible team,\" Wenger said. \"It is because there are so many quality teams in the Premier League and it is just how close you are to your best every time which decides the game.\"</p><p>The Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho, continued in his attempt to paint his team as the title outsiders after the City game, saying that, in a three-horse race, his was the \"little horse.\" Arsenal and City, he said, had to be more heavily fancied.</p><p>\"They [Chelsea] are in there,\" Wenger said. \"It is easy to move out if you don't want ... I just think they are in there, of course. We focus on our side and do not listen too much to what people say. What is important is that it is a period where you show up with good performances.\"</p><p>Arsenal begin a tough sequence at Liverpool. Thereafter, they face Manchester United at home in the league next Wednesday; Liverpool at home in the FA Cup on Sunday week and Bayern Munich at home in the Champions League last 16 first-leg on the Wednesday after that.</p><p>Wenger hopes to be boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere at Anfield. The midfielder has missed the last two matches with ankle trouble and he will undergo a late fitness test. But he believes that he is ready. Wenger will decide whether to use him from the start or as a substitute.</p><p>\"We might have Wilshere back,\" Wenger said. \"It's important to have as many players back as possible in the squad. In the big games, it is always decided by having the complete squad available ... by strong players who have a big statement.</p><p>\"We have had some good wins at Anfield and I have a big respect for the fans there because they really know football. Even, sometimes, when you had good results, their behaviour is unbelievably loyal. It always has been. They are a passionate crowd with a big history and they always behave in a passionate but very fair way.\"</p>","headline":"Arsenal have no regrets not signing Luis Suárez, says Arsène Wenger","trailText":"Arsène Wenger says he has no regrets over the failure to sign Liverpool's Luis Suárez, as he prepares to take Arsenal to Anfield for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg78","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391688096464/Luis-Suarez-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391688096464/Luis-Suarez-006.jpg","wordcount":"755","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429057143","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8653082","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Hytner","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039210","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:02:42Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/06/arsenal-no-regrets-not-signing-luis-suarez-liverpool","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/feb/06/arsenal-no-regrets-not-signing-luis-suarez-liverpool","tags":[{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/arsenal","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}]},{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/liverpool","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"}]},{"id":"football/arsene-wenger","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/arsene-wenger","references":[]},{"id":"football/luis-suarez","webTitle":"Luis Suárez","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/luis-suarez","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/luis-suarez","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidhytner","webTitle":"David Hytner","r2ContributorId":"22566","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/10/07/hytner.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Hytner is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football</a> correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidhytner","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidhytner","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429058450","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391688083527/Luis-Suarez-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Liverpool FC via Getty Images","photographer":"Andrew Powell","altText":"Luis Suarez","height":"54","credit":"Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images","caption":"Arsenal tried to sign Liverpool's Luis Suárez last summer for £40m and £1.

proud of our collective achievements over the past 20 months and I believe we have continued the club's progression in the manner of my predecessors including Roberto Martínez and Brendan

in European qualification.</p><p></p><p>\"In addition, our ninth place in the league was our highest finish in 31 years and the second highest in the club's 102-year history which again is something

For example he welcomed Sir Alex Ferguson to the Manchester velodrome and set up an informal thinktank with the England rugby coach Stuart Lancaster. More recently, he has been visiting ice hockey and basketball managers in the USA.</p><p>The development in Nice is a refinement of an idea from Team Sky's foundation, which was to have a performance hub in the Tuscan town of Quarrata alongside the British Cycling academy, which was sited there from 2007-12. Brailsford got as far as commissioning architects but the plan was quietly&nbsp;shelved.</p><p>The team currently has an administration base alongside British Cycling at the Manchester velodrome and a logistics hub in Belgium.</p><p>Brailsford concedes that the continuing development of Team Sky is demanding more and more of his attention. \"That side of things has got bigger, more global and certainly doesn't leave me a lot of time.\"</p><p>That in turn may eventually have implications for his role as Performance Director at British Cycling, where he has delegated day-to-day running of the squad to his old associate Shane Sutton. The issue is that Sky has turned into a long-term project. \"We have 11 guys out of contract this year and are thinking about building the team for next two or three years. Other teams will try and hire our riders and staff but if we recruit well we've got some good plans.\"</p><p>Brailsford has subtly altered Team Sky's buildup to the 2014 season by extending the squad's rest period in the autumn and having their first get-together later in the off season, because his feeling was that in 2012-13 the team did not have time to regroup before getting on the road again.</p><p>\"[In 2012] the whole Armstrong thing hijacked our one occasion of getting everyone together. This year we tagged three days on to our team meeting, went to a local theatre and talked about what it's all about.</p><p>\"We discussed team values, what we are for. Any team needs constant reminders of what its values are. It's an opportunity for us as a team to voice what we really think; the staff and riders say what's worked, what's brought us success, what could stop us in the future and then everybody has to sign up.</p><p>\"If you look at the competitiveness of professional cycling, we've been successful in last couple of years, but the band of competitive advantage is narrowing all the time, so it comes down to how you look ahead.\"</p>","headline":"Team Sky's French hub may include facilities for sports other than cycling","trailText":"The area around Nice was chosen for its centrality within Europe, the quality of its roads and its fine weather","newspaperPageNumber":"7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfjx","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391618717118/Team-Sky-in-Mallorca-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391618717118/Team-Sky-in-Mallorca-006.jpg","wordcount":"613","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"428993070","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8649411","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"William Fotheringham","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038798","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T16:54:17Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/05/team-sky-hub-france-nice-monaco","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/feb/05/team-sky-hub-france-nice-monaco","tags":[{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/dave-brailsford","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/dave-brailsford","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428994819","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391618706031/Team-Sky-in-Mallorca-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon","altText":"Team Sky in Mallorca","height":"54","credit":"Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","caption":"Team Sky riders training in Mallorca, where Sir Dave Brailsford discussed his plans for developing the team's Nice/Monaco base.
