But a month into the shoot, and despite misgivings over increased traffic from some Romans, director Sam Mendes’ team has won praise for helping to clean up rubbish-strewn, graffiti-plagued areas as part of the filming process,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/rome/11465758/James-Bond-film-crew-clean-up-Rome-on-Spectre-shoot.html http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/rome-james-bond-shoot-cleanup-spectre-007\"> reports the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>Producers are said to have worked with city council workers on the clean-up project, while their introduction of private security firms has helped rid the city of much-detested unlicensed parking attendants in the touristy Trastavere district near the River Tiber. Location fees have brought an estimated €1m into public coffers and news website Linkiesta last week summed up the positive reaction to the arrival of 007 production company Eon with the header “The mayor of Rome is Bond. James Bond”.</p> <p>The picture is a far cry from the one painted last month by campaigners writing on the <a href=\"http://www.bastacartelloni.it/2015/01/ciak-si-gira-nel-degrado-dal-22.html \">Basta Cartelloni blog</a>, who suggested prior to Bond’s arrival that the state of the city was likely to shame Romans. They published photographs showing the 15th-century Ponte Sisto pedestrian bridge appearing dirty and adorned with graffiti and garbage, with the nearby Tiber Farnesina street (where a car chase was due to take place) appearing to be in a similar state.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the makers of Spectre have received a less cheery welcome in Cardiff, where producers have been refused permission to shoot in the main building of the Welsh Assembly, known as the Senedd, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-31861644\">reports the BBC</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Assembly said in a statement: “The Senedd’s Siambr [chamber] is the home of Welsh democracy and seat of government for Wales. Some media activity is allowed in the Siambr when it relates to the work of the assembly or reflects the Siambr’s status as the focal point of Welsh civic life. It is not a drama studio.</p> <p>“Decisions on requests from the creative industries to use the assembly’s estate are made on a case by case basis, and we are proud to have collaborated with many television and film companies on drama productions such as Sherlock and Dr Who. The request by James Bond to use the Siambr was turned down and they were offered alternative locations on the estate which they subsequently declined.”</p> <p>It is not known why Bond would have wanted to shoot in the chamber. Producers have been filming the 24th official 007 movie in London, Rome and the Austrian Alps over the past month. Daniel Craig returns for his fourth turn as Bond in Spectre, which also stars Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux and Monica Bellucci. The film is expected to hit UK cinemas on 23 October and will debut in the US on 6 November.</p>","headline":"When in Rome: James Bond team win praise for litter-picking Spectre

Or, more accurately, a surprisingly wide international audience used to find Vince Vaughn funny. The rambunctious persona premiered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/oct/26/my-favourite-film-swingers\">Swingers</a> – pure id in a party-hard alpha-male – then recycled in hit films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jul/15/1\">Wedding Crashers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1291454,00.html\">Dodgeball</a>, made him a reliably lucrative booking. But last weekend saw his latest comedy – Unfinished Business, a farce about a work trip which gets out of hand – become the biggest flop of his career so far, with toxic reviews and audience apathy.</p> <p>So far, so predictable: Vaughn’s recent back catalogue – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/delivery-man-review\">Delivery Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155768/internship\">The Internship</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148836/watch\">The Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/20/the-dilemma-film-review\">The Dilemma</a> – have all crashed and burned at the box office. His last financial hit was the one-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/15/couples-retreat-review\">Couples Retreat</a> back in 2009 (AKA the film you almost watched on a plane that one time). So what went wrong? How did Vaughn go from being able to open a movie on the power of his name to being beaten by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey\">a film about S&amp;M with no recognisable stars in its fourth week of release</a>?</p> <p>“Vince has just made some really unfortunate choices,” says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety, “and I don’t think he’s got proper orientation around his strengths. He’s a terrific actor who had monster comedy hits, but he’s not a Will Ferrell – that is, a guy born to make us laugh.”</p> <p>“Stars face a tough dilemma,” says box-office analyst Charles Gant. “Either keep churning out what worked in the past, or try something new. Vaughn seems to be doing the former, but who really wants to see a fish-out-of-water Euro-business-trip comedy starring Vaughn, Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson? With Chris Pratt, Zac Efron and Robert De Niro it <em>might</em> have worked, but the premise is pretty unappealing.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d57644fe5167853b0d1df58391da2d6d348ab50\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426178251341/897f5042-3c2e-40d1-8666-cdf3bd94c041-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in Get Hard.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in Get Hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trouble is: Vaughn is not alone. In 2004, the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frat_Pack\">“Frat Pack”</a> was <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-15-frat-pack_x.htm\">coined by USA Today</a> to describe a group of actors who were then starring alongside each other in a string of hit comedies. Their films included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/99240\">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101940/anchorman\">Anchorman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tropic-thunder\">Tropic Thunder </a>and it seemed – for a while at least; a few halcyon days in the mid-noughties – that the whole world over was happy to lap up the Pack’s output.</p> <p>Then the laughs dwindled and fans dissipated. Ben Stiller wisely chased those who now only went to the movies with their kids, with family-friendly franchises such as Madagascar and Night at the Museum. When he aimed his laughs at those nearer his own age (remember <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/tower-heist-film-review\">Tower Heist</a>?) the response was much more muted. Jack Black’s appeal went south after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/130111/year-one\">Year One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/01/the-big-year-review\">The Big Year</a> (note to Black’s agent: avoid titles with “year” in them), while Owen Wilson man-child comedies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/10/hall-pass-film-review\">Hall Pass</a> and Are You Here barely registered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/05/unfinished-business-review\">Unfinished Business review – indifferent post-Horrible Bosses corporate comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 11 years since the Frat Pack was christened, and the 18-odd since it formed, the climate of comedy has inevitably changed. The audience, also. The ever-crucial younger crowd, relied on by studios to come out in force on the increasingly-important opening weekend, have diminishing interest in watching men not far off 50 imitate children. Google-funded flop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155768/internship\">The Internship</a> highlighted the Frat Packers’s misstep in this respect. Reuniting Wilson and Vaughn eight years after Wedding Crashers, the jokes – mainly of the “they’ve never even used a webcam before!” variety – served as an uncomfortable reminder of the divide between the stars on screen and the target demographic.</p> <p>The need to age gracefully is acutely explored in Noah Baumbach’s comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/while-were-young-ben-stiller-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver\">While We’re Young</a>, out in the UK at the start of next month. It’s a reunion for the director and Stiller, who he took to dark (if <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=greenberg.htm\">financially unrewarding</a>) heights in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/134351/greenberg\">Greenberg</a>; another film about the gap between being an adolescent imitating an adult and the terror of bill-paying, dream-burying responsibility. Stiller’s character in the new movie alternates between craving acceptance from his sophisticated elders and admiration from hipsters 20 years his junior. It’s a perfect fit for the star, almost uncomfortably so, and he delivers arguably his greatest performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df28e81d8ead48d078ce5c01ef8d484f0bb3f03a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426178313516/359a656b-f2f3-439d-848d-299d464e1773-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in The Wedding Crashers.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in The Wedding Crashers. Allstar Collection/NEW LINE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It certainly suits him better than his last attempt to “go straight”, 2013’s once-Oscar-tipped remake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty\">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. A pricey passion project for Stiller, who also directed, it confused fridge-magnet insight with profundity and wound up a pale imitation of fellow Frat Packer Will Ferrell’s underrated and under-watched 2006 comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115237/stranger.than.fiction\">Stranger Than Fiction</a>. But that inventive, whimsical tale of a man attempting to save his life from inevitability didn’t click with Ferrell’s core audience, despite strong reviews. The actor has made numerous attempts to break the mould, from Woody Allen’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melinda-and-melinda\">Melinda and Melinda</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/13/everything-must-go-film-review\">Everything Must Go</a>, an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Yet such projects have never landed resoundingly, and he keeps scuttling back to more bankable ground. Plus, when it comes to opening tentpole releases, Ferrell is the obvious exception in the group, with solid returns for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/19/anchorman-2-legend-continues-review\">Anchorman 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148981/campaign\">The Campaign</a>.</p> <p>Yet despite this, Ferrell is increasingly unable to carry a comedy by himself. Later this month he teams up with Kevin Hart for Get Hard, playing a businessman preparing to enter prison. It’s a smart match, given that Hart’s fanbase – including<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinhart4real\"> 17.4m Twitter followers</a> - has helped him score a string of recent hits. After that, Ferrell reunites with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review\">Other Guys</a> co-star Mark Wahlberg – a lone wolf outside the Pack, who manages to straddle comedy and drama – for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528854/reference\">Daddy’s Home</a> (about a stepfather forced to compete with his wife’s ex-husband).</p> <p>Ferrell’s continued chances to shine have, however, eluded Jack Black, who, bar the odd cameo, hasn’t headed up a film since 2011. His next lead is on the small screen, starring alongside Tim Robbins in The Brink, a comedy about a geopolitical crisis. Vaughn, too, has turned to HBO for salvation: the second season of hit crime show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/23/vince-vaughn-colin-farrell-true-detective-hbo\">True Detective </a>will see him play a career criminal alongside Colin Farrell (another actor in need of a hit). Speaking to Variety, Vaughn said he was <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/features/vince-vaughn-on-moving-into-adult-storytelling-with-true-detective-1201444574/\">“moving into a more adult part”</a> of his career. Vaughn is 45 in a fortnight.</p> <p>And Wilson too is having a rethink. Late last year we saw him in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Inherent Vice; soon he’ll be seen in his first non-comic part since 2001’s Behind Enemy Lines: an action lead in thriller No Escape.</p> <p>As the Frat Pack disband, others plug the gap. “I think men behaving like idiots never really gets old,” says Gant. “We just need some fresh faces.” Judd Apatow alumni Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen scored the biggest lead role hits of their careers last year with 22 Jump Street and Bad Neighbours (both have sequels already in development). Melissa McCarthy used an Oscar-nominated role in surprise smash Bridesmaids to score three hits in a row; upcoming summer comedy Spy plus a role in the Ghostbusters reboot will test her status as the most consistently bankable comic actor working today.</p> <p>The diversity that McCarthy and Hart represent (and even the nervy, chubby Hill and Rogen, too) suggest that part of the Pack’s key flaw today is its makeup: all white, all male, all of an age. Even their contemporary Apatow isn’t interested in making movies with them anymore. Instead he’s hunting for successors to Girls and producing and directing a vehicle for a relatively unknown woman (Trainwreck, starring Amy Schumer, positioned as one of the summer’s biggest).</p> <p>And this, perhaps, is why the last gasp of the Pack – Zoolander 2, which Stiller and Wilson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2015/mar/10/zoolander-walk-off-paris-fashion-week-ben-stiller-owen-wilson-full-video\">teased this week</a> on the Valentino catwalk – may just be a stroke of genius. Derek and Hansel were aware they were ageing models ripe for the recycling bin in the first film. Fifteen years on, their plight mirrors that of the actors playing them. Maybe there’s pathos in going out of fashion.</p>","headline":"Hey bro, let it go: how the Frat Pack fell apart","trailText":"In the noughties, Vince Vaughn and buddies including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell could do no wrong, with megahits such as Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball.

So keep up the great work being champions of the arts.”</p> <p>Lynch became a household name as a director with a rare flair for surreal noir, showcased by his cult 1990s TV show Twin Peaks, but had his formative education as a painter. He revealed his distaste for graffiti, which he said had “ruined the world”.</p> <p>Philadelphia, which he described as his “biggest inspiration” and a “very sick, corrupt, filthy fear-ridden city” when he went to art school there in the 1960s, was said to be the birthplace of graffiti, Lynch said.<br /></p> <p>“Graffiti to me has pretty much ruined the world. It’s ruined it for film, when you go to a place to film, everything is graffitied so if you don’t want it, you have to paint it out,” he said.</p> <p>“So much great architecture is graffitied over, so many great train stations, factories, are graffitied over and its a horrible, horrible thing. Trees have gone away and graffiti has taken their place.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9254e7f936b89b02ed169ef687b4954e6562b749\"> <img

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: QAGOMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a wide ranging question and answer session, Lynch spoke of everything from his devotion to transcendental meditation (“twice a day, never missed a meditation for 40 years”) to his resentment of anti-smoking regulations and inexplicable love of “smokestacks” and “oil impregnated earth”.<br /></p> <p>He was tight-lipped in response to inevitable questions about details the widely-anticipated<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/06/twin-peaks-returns-weve-waited-long-enough\"> third season of Twin Peaks</a>, which ended prematurely in 1991.<br /></p> <p>However, Lynch did reveal that the idea to revisit the show had its genesis in lunches four years ago with co-writer Mark Frost at “one Hollywood’s oldest restaurants”, Musso and Frank Grill.</p> <p>Lynch’s comments on the importance of arts funding were later applauded by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who as arts minister welcomed the auteur in a speech in which she revealed her love of Twin Peaks.</p> <p>Palaszczuk also told reporters she was considering restoring the premier’s literary awards, which were axed by her conservative predecessor Campbell Newman in one of his first acts in office. </p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/upcoming/davidlynch\">David Lynch: Between

deal of attention in the world’s media. However it’s no secret that most of this attention is not merely unfavourable; but in many cases, the Kim dynasty is the object of ridicule. </p> <p>For the average reader of western media, neither Kim Jong-un nor his late father Kim Jong-il are presented as the embodiment of evil incarnate. Rather, they are the butt of international jokes – often crude or very personal. </p> <p>Independent reports about North Korea are difficult to verify and the country is culturally isolated, leaving speculation and humour to fill the void. </p> <p>There are many ways in which the western media likes to make fun of North Korea: the typical North Korean strongman is portrayed as plump, round-faced, with a bad haircut and strange garb. These ‘tyrants of Pyongyang’ are regarded with a comical, almost clownish air, which can sometimes gloss over claims of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\">serious human rights abuses</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/20/kim-jong-un-defies-gravity-itself-with-new-haircut\">Kim Jong-un defies gravity with new haircut</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>‘Confrontation maniacs’</h2> <p>It does not help that the North Korean media is fond of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/-sp-north-korea-sony-interview\">elaborate expressions and macabre threats</a> that, even when accounting for a translation gap, can be hard to take seriously. </p> <p>Insults thrown at their key antagonists, the “US imperialists and their stooges” sound more comical than menacing: various state leaders have been described as “confrontation maniacs” “rabid dogs” and in the case of former US vice president Dick Cheney “a mentally deranged person steeped in the inveterate enmity towards the system in the DPRK”.<br /></p> <p>But does the average North Korean understand the humour in any of this? Do they know that the rulers of their country, whom they admire or despise – depending on personal political inclinations – are described as a joke?

Ever since, this alleged popularity has been core to the country’s propaganda.<br /></p> <p>Foreign support to the Kim cult is important to North Korea’s world view. It appears to be the major reason why the North Korean government provides support to assorted Juche study groups worldwide. The groups vary in size and success from being ‘<a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2014/06/interview-thousands-of-north-korea-juche-supporters-exist-in-nigeria/\">thousands of supporters in Nigeria</a>’ to smaller groups in <a href=\"https://jucheireland.wordpress.com/\">Ireland</a> and <a href=\"http://friendsofkorea.blogspot.co.uk/\">the UK</a>, with Juche sometimes referred to as ‘Kimilsungism’ meaning the study of former leader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung\">Kim Il-sung</a>’s political thesis. </p> <p>Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the North Korean government entertained the idea of the Juche ideology <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/juche.htm\">competing</a> with Leninism, Maoism and other radical leftist ideas.<strong> </strong>They spent a significant amount of their meagre resources but by the late 1970s, it became obvious that such investments had gone nowhere: the idea had won very few authentic supporters. </p> <p>Support was significantly scaled back but Juche study group subsidies were not completely discontinued. Foreign Juche admirers were still occasionally flown to Pyongyang, at the expense of the North Korean state, but their role changed.<br /></p> <p>These supports had became props in the country’s propaganda narrative. Admiring foreigners would regularly appear on TV screens and newspaper pages delivering praise for the leadership.<br /></p> <h2>Global friendships</h2> <p>Today, almost every issue of North Korea’s major newspapers will publish at least one piece on the activities of Kim supporters worldwide. The North Korean people are constantly reminded that their leaders are respected across the world – not only because of the might of their weapons, but also because of the irresistible nature of their ideas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>State media constantly reminds North Koreans that their leaders are respected across the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This week North Korea announced it was forging a “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/russia-and-north-korea-forge-year-of-friendship-pariah-alliance\">year of friendship</a>” with Russia, deepening economic and political ties which may complicate the west’s relationship to Vladimir Putin – a leader also subject to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/01/russian-official-burns-obama-with-putin-leopard-pic/\">comical coverage</a> alongside criticism. </p> <p>In the last three days of February North Korean media reported the following events: meetings held in Uganda, Pakistan, Congo, Dominican Republic, Russia, Nigeria, Nepal, Benin and South Africa to celebrate Kim Jong-il’s recent birthday; articles about the Kim family’s great achievement published by newspapers in Germany, Russia, Italy, Thailand, Uruguay, Malaysia, Cambodia; seminars and other events in Italy, Uganda, Egypt, Poland and Austria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/10/north-korea-tv-propaganda-kim-jong-il\">A propaganda merry-go-round: what North Koreans watch on TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In most cases these were small-scale events, paid for by North Korean embassies, and the publications in question were run by either marginal radical newspapers or as paid advertisements by larger outlets. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the average North Korean has no way of knowing that the Die Rote Fahne, which published some homage to Kim Jong-un, is a website run by one of five or six competing, but tiny, communist parties of Germany.</p> <p>North Koreans are bombarded with propaganda which paints their country as a major player, and their leaders as figures which inspire admiration across the world. One article claimed that <a href=\"http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9704/news4/07.htm\">450 streets in 100 countries had been named after Kim Il-sung</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DPRKbot/statuses/575324182738763776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Improve The Hygiene And One Will As The Major Tasks Given By The Party Is The Most Important In Demonstrating The Party&#39;s Policies!</p>&mdash; DPRK bot (@DPRKbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DPRKbot/status/575324182738763776\">March 10, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A propaganda-loaded state media and very few western journalists allowed in – and if they are, their movements are strictly monitored – make independent reporting from North Korea very difficult. <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2014/03/why-kim-jong-un-hairstyle-order-is-unlikely-true/%20\">NK News have previously called</a> this an “an echo-chamber effect” of rumours based on anonymous sources. </p> <h2>The defector perspective </h2> <p>But North Korea is not regarded with laughter by all. Many refugees I’ve spoken to have a hostile or highly critical attitude to the North Korean government and its leaders. </p> <p>They believe the Kim dynasty is hellbent on furthering their own malign interests – not a bunch of clowns whose insults are as ridiculous as their haircuts. Furthermore, when they encounter such attitudes they can sometimes feel offended, since these jokes are seen as an insult to their country too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/north-korea-meme-generator-kim-jong-un\">Add brilliance!

culture has categorised them as clowns – a phenomenon that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/06/north-korea-the-interview\">unlikely to disappear any time soon</a>.</p> <p>Kim

Gad <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/02/sneak-peek-frozen-fever-anna-elsa-olaf/22682959/\">said of the new song</a>: “If history is any indicator, kids will go nuts.”</p> <p>Frozen is the highest-grossing musical of all time as well as topping the animation box office, and its worldwide total of $1.3bn puts it at number five <a href=\"http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/\">in the list of all-time grossers</a>. As a global merchandising phenomenon – <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/guess-frozen-dresses-sold/story?id=26679037\">more than three million Elsa dresses have sold worldwide</a> – the film has helped push Disney to record profits.</p> <p>The company also used Thursday’s meeting to announce its latest plans for the Star Wars film franchise. The eighth episode in the series will be released on 26 May, 2017, it was announced, and a spin-off film, Rogue One, starring Oscar nominee Felicity Jones, will debut in December 2016, shortly after the release of the seventh episode, Star Wars: The Force Awakens.<br /></p> <p>Investors re-elected 10 board members at the meeting, including the chief executive, Bob Iger, who has led Disney through a blockbuster 2014 thanks to the popularity of Frozen and a good year for its theme parks. Iger, chief executive of the company since 2005 and chairman since 2012, received $43.7m in 2014, up 27% from the previous year. </p> <p>An attendee asked Iger whether Disney employees would also get a raise. He said that, after increasing basic pay to $10 an hour for employees covered by one of its largest unions, Disney has extended the commitment to all hourly employees.</p>","headline":"Frozen 2 announcement makes little Elsas – and Disney shares – jump for joy","trailText":"Josh Gad, who played snowman Olaf in original blockbuster, confirmed to return, with Idina Menzel and Kristin Bell also expected to join","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426221977471/058b3c20-77c3-48b7-bfb8-eae439c05841-140x84.png","wordcount":"586","commentable":"true","byline":"Nancy Groves and Lauren Gambino in New York","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-16T15:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/13/frozen-2-announcement-makes-little-elsas-and-disney-shares-jump-for-joy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/13/frozen-2-announcement-makes-little-elsas-and-disney-shares-jump-for-joy","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/frozen","webTitle":"Frozen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/frozen","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/walt-disney-company","webTitle":"Walt Disney Company","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/walt-disney-company","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/animation","webTitle":"Animation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/animation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/animation","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/business","sectionName":"Business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nancy-groves","webTitle":"Nancy Groves","r2ContributorId":"28698","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/19/1421674486181/Nancy-Groves.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/19/1421674503790/Nancy-Groves-R.png","firstName":"nancy","lastName":"groves","twitterHandle":"nancyarts","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nancy is culture editor of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/au\">Guardian Australia</a>.

Australian film renaissance of the 1970s, lately dubbed the New Wave, brought a reinvigorated national cinema to local and overseas attention. The first of the New Wave features to find acclaim abroad was a hard yakka story about a bunch of salt-of-the-earth sheep shearers who congregate at a remote station to work, drink, sweat and battle their boss for a decent pay.</p> <p>That film, Sunday Too Far Away (1975), was a first on other fronts, too: the first Australian feature film to play in the director’s fortnight category at Cannes, the first to be produced by the South Australian Film Commission and the first for its director, Ken Hannam.</p> <p>It marks an early milestone in the career of the actor Jack Thompson, whose cachet as a fair dinkum alpha male would see him to return with numerous iterations of that role (and varying amounts of his facial hair) as the years progressed. Thompson plays Foley, a gun shearer circa 1956 who has held the record for the number of sheep sheared for a decade. He returns to work to give the job he’s good at one final crack before retirement, but loses his status to a rival colleague (Peter Cummins).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRWLQNnqVc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhRWLQNnqVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Sunday Too Far Away.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunday Too Far Away opens with that quintessential Australian image: a bright sun blazing in front of a yellow sky above a panorama of red dirt. On the ground Foley dozes off while driving his FJ Holden down a dusty road. The car topples several times before the protagonist emerges unscathed but a mite agitated.</p> <p>Foley discovers there is blood on his face (“bugger me”) then picks up his bag and walks into town. The film’s first interior is, of course, the pub. Foley doesn’t have to ask for a beer before a drink is poured and the bar lady is informed of his plans. “I’ve come back but I’m not gonna bust my gut. I’m gonna shear nice and steady,” he says. “Ease up on the grog. Put a little bit away.”</p> <p>At the shearing station the rest of the fellas are introduced, including an unpopular chef with an affection for lemon essence, and Foley’s roommate, an elderly alcoholic called Garth (Reg Lye). It doesn’t take long for the film’s staunchly pro-union pitch to kick in; the shearers um and ah about who their rep is (that job is forced on to Foley) but quickly rally for better conditions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/07/jack-thompson-i-was-adopted-by-the-yolngu-nation\">Jack Thompson: I was adopted by the Yolngu nation as their own son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The men pass a motion prohibiting their boss from entering the premise (also, Foley has eyes on his daughter), laying the groundwork for a final act about taking a stand for workers’ rights. Most dramatically, the shearers fight the “scabs” sent to replace them. In the great blokey Australian knockabout spirit there’s a lot of shouting and a punch-up. But Hannam’s direction is also very close to his actors, and the wizened spirit of these men (the cast is terrific) leaves a lasting impression.</p> <p>The film’s title comes from a legendary lament reportedly from a shearer’s wife: “Friday night [he’s] too tired; Saturday night too drunk; Sunday, too far away.” Those final four words also match up to a broader reading of the film: its portrait of lives spent working for the weekend and the dispiriting emotions that entails. </p> <p>The work-life tussle is known by several labels: the rat race, taking care of business, working nine to five. While footage of Thompson and the boys shearing sheep in 50s clothes may feel a little like a time capsule these days, Sunday Too Far Away’s depiction of a sobering truth – that most of our lives are governed by need rather than choice – continue to make it relevant.<br /></p>","headline":"Sunday Too Far Away rewatched – hard yakka story of shearers and scabs","trailText":"An early milestone for Jack Thompson, Ken Hannam’s 1975 tale of salt-of-the-earth sheep shearers is a sobering portrait of life spent working for the weekend, writes <strong>Luke Buckmaster</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426208150877/99162dc4-967a-4518-b7db-f9497b6d67b0-140x84.png","wordcount":"630","commentable":"true","byline":"Luke Buckmaster","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-16T12:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/13/sunday-too-far-away-rewatched-hard-yakka-story-of-shearers-and-scabs","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/13/sunday-too-far-away-rewatched-hard-yakka-story-of-shearers-and-scabs","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","webTitle":"Rewatching classic Australian films","description":"In this retrospective series we rewatch Australian films that have stood the test of time.","type":"series","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/australia","webTitle":"Australian film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/australia","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/luke-buckmaster","webTitle":"Luke Buckmaster","r2ContributorId":"57812","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413372700044/Luke-Buckmaster.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413372718286/Luke-Buckmaster-L.png","firstName":"luke","lastName":"buckmaster","twitterHandle":"lukebuckmaster","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Luke Buckmaster is film critic and writer for Guardian Australia, and contributes commentary to a range of Australian publications.

Asa Butterfield (the lead in Scorsese’s 2011 movie Hugo) plays Nathan, a teen maths star whose disorders are worsened by the death of his father, making him retreat into the comforting world of numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/mar/12/x-plus-y-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/46tvk\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2257004\"                data-video-name=\"X+Y - video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426173446976/crop_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455871183\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426173442282/crop_1200x720.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10140174&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>X+Y - video review</figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother – an intelligent, compassionate performance from Sally Hawkins – must deal with it all as best she can. But then a troubled school maths teacher (Rafe Spall) enters Nathan for the maths Olympiad and there he finds his unemotional world rocked by an even more brilliant, beautiful maths whiz from China: Zhang Mei (Jo Yang). It’s an engaging film with a nice supporting performance from Eddie Marsan as the Olympians’ team coach, though the Olympiad itself turns out to be, somewhat oppressively, just one big, glorified exam, and the narrative question of whether some things are more important than maths is only really broached at the end of the film. But this is an attractively unparochial drama with a bracing interest in excellence.</p>","headline":"X+Y review – a charming mathematical uncertainty","trailText":"Competitive maths + teenage romance

Ludivine Sagnier may be evolving into French cinema’s answer to Miranda Hart. It’s a commercial French picture of the kind that generally doesn’t cross the Channel well: a bit DayGlo, a bit cutesy, a bit fey. You might need a very sweet tooth for this – sweeter than mine anyway. Lou! is an adaptation of a comic-book series, directed by its original creator Julien Neel. Lou herself, played by Lola Lasseron, is a lonely teen who lives with her gawky, awkward single mum, played by Sagnier with unflattering glasses. They have a chaotic flat in the romanticised, cartoonified big city, perennially short on cash, and always terrified at the prospect of a visit from Lola’s stern grandmother, played by Nathalie Baye. Lou dreams about the boy next door, and worries that her mother needs love. The arrival of a nice-looking guy her mother’s age changes everything. Sometimes, when this film retreats into its various fantasy worlds, it looks like a diluted version of a Michel Gondry film. But there isn’t the same level of comedy and invention: the level of sugary silliness is a little too high.</p>","headline":"Lou! review – France’s sickly sweet answer to Miranda

imminent adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd, here is the restored re-release of John Schlesinger’s mighty 1967 version, superbly photographed by Nicolas Roeg (the drunken labourer’s vision of throbbing, swaying cows is a psychedelic mini-masterpiece). Julie Christie is luminous as the headstrong and narcissistic Bathsheba, newly installed mistress of a handsome farmstead and loved by three men, played by those galácticos of 1960s British cinema: Peter Finch as landowner Mr Boldwood, Alan Bates as the capable shepherd Gabriel Oak and Terence Stamp as the blade-twirling Sergeant Troy. And Stamp has an animation and conviction in this role that he never equalled elsewhere. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/terence-stamp-i-was-in-my-prime-but-when-the-60s-ended-i-ended-with-it\">Terence Stamp: ‘I was in my prime, but when the 60s ended, I ended with it’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The movie is famous for Troy’s phallic swordplay as he teasingly slices and dices the very air around the dazzled Bathsheba. Viewed now, the scene looks creepier and pornier than ever, and the itinerant Troy almost seems like a serial killer. The painterly close-up gallery of rustic faces in this movie is tremendous – particularly that of Freddie Jones (father of Toby), playing Cainy Ball – and the singing scenes at harvest supper are wonderful. Finch and Stamp , in their differing ways, show the emotional masochism and self-destruction in Hardy’s male characters, and the candour and charm of Bates’s initial “proposal” scene are superbly done. Christie carries the film with her own insouciant vulnerability. A classic.</p>","headline":"Far from the Madding Crowd review – seductive swordplay, psychedelic cows","trailText":"Julie Christie is luminous and Terence Stamp a blade-twirling dazzler in John

roadshow rolls on. This New York layover – overseen by Non-Stop’s Jaume Collet-Serra – improves on recent outings: unlike the Taken sequels, it never cuts around the arse-whupping you’ve paid to see, and it grounds all its beat-downs in appreciably supple character business. While doing a dusk-till-dawn shepherding job on an estranged son (Joel Kinnaman) who’s witnessed a mob hit, Neeson’s boozy, washed-up former hitman faces off at regular intervals against heavyweight thesps Ed Harris, Vincent D’Onofrio and Nick Nolte. Swooping CG scene transitions add a needless touch of Google Maps-era flash to fundamentally retro material, but Collet-Serra stages pulse-elevating car chases and bar brawls, and weaves in pleasing local detail: an ice-hockey derby provides big Liam with one ingenious avenue of escape, while the Irish-American Christmas setting pays off with a taproom shootout scored to Fairytale of New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/mar/12/run-all-night-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/46tvv\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2256984\"                data-video-name=\"Run All Night -

Like the near-abstract fishing-themed film Leviathan, or farming-focused Our Daily Bread, My Name Is Salt unveils without commentary or judgment the effort required for one Indian family to harvest high-quality salt crystals from the mud of the Little Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. It’s an arduous, low-tech operation that involves digging ditches by hand, pumping ground water with noisy engines – which provide the film with a constant background beat – and crushing crust with giant stones at exactly the right moment. Director Farida Pacha and cinematographer Lutz Konermann transmute all this labour into a mesmerising, lyrical work about endurance, craftsmanship and family dynamics, all unfolding in a stunningly bleak landscape, where abandoned bicycles and machinery pepper the ground. Marcel Vaid’s score is aptly sparse, but seasons the images perfectly.</p>","headline":"My Name Is Salt review – a mesmerising, lyrical work","trailText":"The latest entry in the expanding subgenre of

thriller from France could be the most interesting film of the week: gripping and ingenious. It’s the kind of picture that Claude Chabrol might have admired. Yet there is just a tiny UK release: can’t its distributor, StudioCanal, be persuaded to get this into more cinemas? I predict Elle l’adore – from actor-turned-director Jeanne Herry – will gain its own cult following on Netflix, then get a Hollywood remake that won’t be half as good as the original. At its centre is a veteran superstar <em>chanteur</em>, Vincent Lacroix, played by Laurent Lafitte, living a gilded celebrity life in Paris. (The director’s own father was just such a singer.) Sandrine Kiberlain plays middle-aged divorcee Muriel – his biggest fan. Since her teenage years, poor Muriel has written to him every day, bought all his records, gone to all his concerts, hung around the stage door afterwards. She is a sad case, a fantasist and obsessive, just short of being a stalker, and Vincent has become wearily resigned to her peripheral presence in his life. But when Vincent gets into a terrible jam, he realises there is only one person he can turn to for help. Kiberlain is excellent as Muriel: the high-functioning sociopath – gaunt yet girlish, parasitic and predatory – and there is a nicely turned subplot concerning an emotional crisis in the lives of the investigating cops. An elegant, disturbing movie.</p>","headline":"Elle L’adore (She Worships Him) – gripping film is sure to attract a cult following","trailText":"Sandrine Kiberlain plays an obsessive, near-stalker fan

Director Evan Kosiner’s meagre concert film boasts “lost” footage of the Toronto rapper performing to an ecstatic hometown crowd. It’s cut together with an interminably dull back story delivered in a rambling monotone by Drake’s former boss, Rap-a-Lot Records CEO James Prince. Kosiner is a self-described “serial entrepreneur” who made money in children’s TV and DJ-ing bar mitzvahs. Hype and bravado can get you far in the rap game.

the Boyhood actor was suffering a bout of stage fright, he turned to the great concert pianist – and ended up making a documentary about him</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2219650/\">Seymour Bernstein</a>, the great classical pianist, quit the stage in 1977, deciding that a recital at the 92nd St Y in New York City would be his farewell – though he didn’t tell anyone of his decision. He didn’t return to the stage until last year, when actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ethan-hawke\">Ethan Hawke </a>asked him to play a small concert as a grand gesture for a documentary Hawke was directing about the now 87-year-old piano teacher, called<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2219650/\"> Seymour: An Introduction</a>.</p> <p>“Why did I decide to play the recital at the end of the movie? Because he asked me,” Bernstein tells the Guardian. “I wouldn’t have turned him down for the world.”</p> <p>Hawke and Bernstein struck up a friendship at a dinner party hosted by one of Bernstein’s pupils. Something in their conversation struck a chord with Hawke, who had been struggling with late-onset stage fright. “I had been dealing with a lot of my own issues about anxiety and performance that were starting to seem like a real crisis in my life,” says Hawke. “When I met Seymour, I saw someone who had devoted his life to the arts and was brimming with joy and bristling with creativity, and energy, and hopefulness.”</p> <p>For Hawke, Bernstein was not only a new friend but a mentor, a fellow performer who had navigated the rocky road of performance anxiety and come out happier. “I see so many people in the arts who are beaten down by either success or failure,” says Hawke. “I didn’t want that. I wanted to be hopeful.” He found that hope in conversation – and kinship – with Bernstein and decided to help share Bernstein’s insight with the world through a film, the first Hawke has directed.</p> <p>“The film is about Seymour, it’s about his beliefs and his message,” says Hawke. “Some of the things that Seymour speaks about were things that I had never heard before.” So the two friends – who clearly share a deep respect for each other, happily interrupting one other and laughing throughout the interview – set out over the course of two years of sporadic filming to make a documentary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhtIcP6AdHo\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dhtIcP6AdHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>“It’s so fun to lay yourself bare,” says Hawke. “I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I wanted to make this documentary. I knew that [Seymour] was a worthy subject. But I had never made a documentary before and [he] had never been in one. We were both at this absolute starting place. And that feels so good.”</p> <p>“That didn’t feel good to me,” interjects Bernstein. “I was scared out of my wits the first time.” Bernstein, who left his stage career partially due to nerves, said that the first time the cameras were rolling, “I blacked out.” He persevered with the project, though, and by the third day of filming he was comfortable in front of the camera.</p> <p>That perseverance is central to the film’s theme, which is as much the story of Bernstein as a meditation on art and the practice of craft. “The film opens with me at my piano, practicing a<a href=\"http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxdscarl.html\"> Scarlatti</a> piece, and I kept missing a leap – that was already a struggle. It wasn’t staged, it was a real, live moment of a pianist practicing,” said Bernstein. “Do you know what that does to a person? One moment you can’t do something and through the effort – the struggle – you find out how you can survive that particular challenge. You get a rush of pride and a love for yourself. Parents get that with their children. Teachers get that with their pupils. What a rush!”</p> <p>“The struggle is everything,” confirmed Hawke. “The struggle makes everything.”</p> <p>In the film, Bernstein continually points out how important it is for people to hone their craft, despite their anxiety. “Nervousness is part of what we do,” he says in the film, offering up an anecdote where actress <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/sarah-bernhardt-9210057\">Sarah Bernhardt</a> tells a young upstart: “You will get nervous when you learn how to act.”</p> <p>However, Hawke did his best to make sure that the subject of his documentary was at ease. Instead of having Bernstein narrate the film as a monologue or cast himself as an off-camera interviewer, Hawke conscripted Bernstein’s friends and pupils to interview him on camera and act as the audience’s proxy.</p> <p>“Everybody had different jobs to do to help tell the story about what [Seymour’s] teaching is about,” said Hawke.</p> <p>For instance, New York Times critic<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/michael_kimmelman/index.html\"> Michael Kimmelman</a>, a former student of Bernstein’s, chats with him during the film, while the cameras roll. “Michael could be the one to put Seymour on the spot a little bit, and make him answer why he quit performing,” said Hawke. “I could have had a whole documentary about that conversation. It was amazing.”</p> <p>One of the themes of many of those conversations is the role of the artist in society. When Hawke mentions artists who have struggled under the weight of success or failure, Bernstein seemingly brushes them off. (In the film the late pianist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/20/glenn-gould-wilfully-idiotic-genius\">Glenn Gould</a> is dismissed as “a total neurotic mess”.)</p> <p>“Mostly those people who are unfocused and neurotic; they can be great artists, but they are doing it for the wrong reasons. They are doing it for self-aggrandizement or to make money or because they don’t know what else to do,” said Bernstein. “They have no idea that they are emissaries for the greatest minds the composers and the writers – what a responsibility it is, what a privilege it is.”</p> <ul> <li>Seymour: An Introduction opens in the US on 13 March.<br /></li> </ul>","headline":"Ethan Hawke and Seymour Bernstein: Hollywood's unlikeliest double act","trailText":"When the Boyhood actor was suffering a bout of stage fright, he turned to the great concert pianist – and ended up making a documentary about him","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426186233251/a4b474ec-1c6c-4216-896f-66df4a6ef309-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"926","commentable":"true","byline":"Melissa Locker","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-15T16:00:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/ethan-hawke-seymour-bernstein-documentary-interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/12/ethan-hawke-seymour-bernstein-documentary-interview","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/ethan-hawke","webTitle":"Ethan Hawke","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ethan-hawke","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/ethan-hawke","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","webTitle":"Classical music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/documentary","webTitle":"Documentary","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/documentary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/documentary","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/melissa-locker","webTitle":"Melissa Locker","r2ContributorId":"66351","firstName":"melissa","lastName":"locker","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/melissa-locker","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/melissa-locker","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"f7c22ef3f3711accb6884fe1909aecebd7d60354","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426186231828/a4b474ec-1c6c-4216-896f-66df4a6ef309-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426186231828/a4b474ec-1c6c-4216-896f-66df4a6ef309-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"Robin Holland","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Seymour Bernstein, left, and Ethan Hawke.","suppliersReference":"NYET405","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: Robin Holland/AP","caption":"Seymour Bernstein, left, and Ethan Hawke: ‘I see so many people in the arts who are beaten down by either success or failure.

href=\"http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Features/D0DB13181492C8E285257DFD0048BA22?OpenDocument\">According to a report on the US website Tax Analysts</a>, Mexico offered incentives in exchange for changes to to the script of Spectre, including a request for a Mexican Bond girl and a non-Mexican villain.</p> <p>Shooting for the latest instalment of the Bond franchise, to be directed by Sam Mendes, is due to begin next week.</p> <p>The report, based on internal Sony emails that were posted online by hackers purportedly linked to North Korea, said that studio executives from Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM pressured for changes to the script to secure the incentives. </p> <p>“You have done a great job in getting us the Mexican incentive,” wrote Jonathan Glickman, president of MGM’s motion picture group, in an email to the film’s producers. “Let’s continue to pursue whatever avenues we have available to maximize this incentive.”<br /></p> <p>Mexico’s requests for changes to the film script went much further than the conditions governments typically attach to filming deals, Tax Analysts reported.<br /></p> <p>The studio apparently allowed Mexican authorities to “make casting decisions, dictate characters’ ethnicities, and even change the occupation of an unnamed character that never appears on-screen or figures into the story outside of the opening scene”, the

Officials insisted that Sciarra “cannot be Mexican” and preferred that his target be an international leader.</p> <p>The Mexicans also reportedly demanded a Bond girl role for “a known Mexican actress”. This part of the deal, at least, appears to have been secured with the announcement last week that <a href=\"http://www.007.com/stephanie-sigman-joins-spectre/\">Stephanie Sigman had been cast in the movie</a>.</p> <p>Sigman, ironically, made her name in the critically acclaimed low-budget Mexican film Miss Bala, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/30/miss-bala-stephanie-sigman-review\">in which she plays a poverty-stricken beauty tossed around the underworld of drug violence facilitated by police corruption</a>. </p> <p>At the presentation of the film in Toronto, director Gerardo Naranjo called it “the story of a crumbling country”.</p> <p>Mexican officials appeared eager to avoid any hint of such a negative portrayal of their country: in his email to the producer, Glickman said that highlighting Mexico City’s “modern aspects” could help the producers obtain an extra $6m of tax breaks. </p> <p>In another email, former head of Sony Pictures Amy Pascal suggested that travel footage could help the producers secure additional funding. “We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money,” she wrote.</p> <p>The emails also suggest Mexican officials wanted to replace a cage fight with a chase through Mexico’s famed Day of the Dead celebrations, as well as include impressive aerial shots of the capital’s skyline when Bond steals Sciarra’s helicopter.</p> <p>Although the Mexican institutions involved have not been revealed, the attempt to massage the country’s image fits into a wider context of determined efforts by the authorities to play down the country’s security crisis, after a decade of drug-fuelled violence that has killed about 100,000 people.</p> <p>President Enrique Peña Nieto was elected in 2012 with the help of a slick publicity campaign that made much of his telenovela good looks and telenovela star wife. His first 18 months in office were marked by a public relations crusade aimed at convincing the world that the country’s long-running security crisis was a minor problem, trumped by his modernising economic vision.</p> <p>Today that image has been badly tarnished by emblematic atrocities that cannot be ignored, such as the disappearance of 43 students in September after they were attacked by police in league with a drug cartel.</p>","headline":"Mexico offered James Bond film studios millions to shoot its good side","trailText":"Officials offered Sony Pictures and MGM up to $20m in tax incentives to make changes to upcoming Bond film that cast country in positive light","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/abf9715bf746ec3d8eff2efc91317e32b273981c/0_195_1960_1176/140.jpg","wordcount":"624","commentable":"true","byline":"Jo Tuckman in Mexico City","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-15T15:45:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/mexico-james-bond-film-spectre-tax-incentives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/mar/12/mexico-james-bond-film-spectre-tax-incentives","sectionName":"World news","tags":[{"id":"world/mexico","webTitle":"Mexico","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/mexico","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/jamesbond","webTitle":"James Bond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/jamesbond","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jotuckman","webTitle":"Jo Tuckman","r2ContributorId":"15828","firstName":"","lastName":"tuckman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jo Tuckman has been working as a freelance correspondent based in Mexico since she moved there in 2000 in anticipation of the fall of 71 years of one party rule.

It was the fourth directing collaboration for the couple, who met in 1995 and married in 2013. Asked in 2006 about the overlap between their personal and professional lives, Glatzer said: “We decided that if we were going to direct together, the best move would be to sleep together.”</p> <p>They adapted Still Alice from the self-published 2007 novel of the same name by the neuroscientist Lisa Genova. The film, about the gradual mental decline of a linguistics professor who is diagnosed in her 50s with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, was given an extra emotional charge by Glatzer’s steadily worsening condition. He began to exhibit symptoms shortly before the couple decided to adapt Genova’s novel, with the official diagnosis coming in 2013. Julianne Moore, who won the best actress prize from all the major awards bodies for her performance in the lead role, reflected on this in her Oscar acceptance speech: “When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that’s what he did.”</p> <p>Still Alice spared audiences much of the physical deterioration associated with degenerative illness, concentrating instead on the confusion, anger and sadness experienced by its main character and her family, including her husband (Alec Baldwin) and their three adult children. The picture’s greatest strength is its ability to evoke the sort of subtle slippages in time and memory that become commonplace to Alzheimer’s sufferers. Discovering in the kitchen the phone that we saw her searching for in the previous scene, Alice exclaims: “I was looking for that last night!” Her husband turns to his daughter and whispers: “That was a month ago.” The disorientation we experience is all the greater for being muffled.</p> <p>“When we were adapting the book, a lot of personal stuff went in there from Richard,” said Westmoreland. “I think a lot of his feeling about his own situation percolated through into Alice. Even when he was on set he was directing with one finger using a voice app on an iPad. It sort of inspired the cast and crew. This is what we’re making the movie about: diseases can come but the people are still there.”</p> <p>Glatzer was born in Flushing, New York. He was raised in Long Island, New York, and in Livingston, New Jersey, and graduated from the University of Michigan. He also earned a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia, where he ran the film department and struck up an important friendship with Frank Capra. The general upswing in interest in Capra’s work during the 1970s has been credited to Glatzer.</p> <p>He moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s and worked with the screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/may/05/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Jay Presson Allen</a> (Marnie, Cabaret) and her producer husband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/13/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Lewis Allen</a>, whom he counted as mentors. Glatzer began his career in reality television with the daytime show Divorce Court. His experiences there partly inspired his first feature, Grief (1993), which portrayed the off-screen exploits of the cast and crew of a tacky soap called The Love Judge. While the camp humour suggested that Glatzer was following in John Waters’s footsteps (one of the plot-lines concerns the provenance of an unsightly stain on the office sofa), there was poignancy too: the title refers to the death from Aids of the main character’s partner.</p> <p>He continued to work in television – his CV was peppered with hit shows such as The Osbournes and America’s Next Top Model – and also ran the underground Los Angeles club Sit-and-Spin. He later returned to film in collaboration with Westmoreland. They co-directed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/90937/fluffer\" title=\"\">The Fluffer</a> (2001), a low-budget comedy about the adult film industry; the title refers to the crew member whose job it is to keep the leading man on a porn shoot fit for purpose. Westmoreland wrote the screenplay, which was informed by his own background directing porn movies.</p> <p>The couple teamed up next to co-write and co-direct <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/echo-park-la\" title=\"\">Quinceañera</a> (2006), set in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, where they were living at the time. The script examined both Latino culture in the US and the gentrification that was creeping into Mexican neighbourhoods. Production was fast – the picture was written, cast and shot in under three months – and the budget low. “We approached it as if it was a documentary,” said Glazter, who also cited the British kitchen-sink drama A Taste of Honey as a major influence on Quinceañera. The film, which won the audience award and the grand jury prize at the Sundance film festival, presented a fond portrait of the Latino community but also featured a self-critique in the form of two gay characters loosely based by the film-makers on themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16942add44ff963582ce69a108ac2269281ada90\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426186244142/615dfee7-d4c0-47dd-a848-e6875fcb167e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Julianne Moore in Still Alice, co-written and co-directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.

Everybody buys houses and sees the property value go up and people think that’s great but we also thought it would be great to draw the gay community’s attention to the fact that something is being lost and also, if you want to fuck somebody and don’t want to invite them to dinner – that’s kind of cruel. We want to draw attention a little bit to the coded racism where you fetishise something different but because it’s different you don’t want to go beyond the physical.”</p> <p>Glatzer and Westmoreland were among the producers of Pedro (2008), a film about the gay Cuban-American reality TV star Pedro Zamora. They also co-wrote and co-directed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/kevin-kline-errol-flynn-sex-scandal\" title=\"\">The Last of Robin Hood </a>(2013) starring Kevin Kline as Errol Flynn. The movie documented the relationship between the ageing actor and a 17-year-old chorus girl. It met with a mixed reception, much like all their films.

How will this legend of British acting introduce himself? What pearl of wisdom will he divulge? Stamp, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/interviews/meetings-remarkable-men-terence-stamp-interview\">self-confessed “decadent”</a> and former holder of the title of world’s best-looking man (1963-1969) speaks: “Gotta take a slash, man. Where’s the gents?” Having been pointed in the right direction, Stamp returns, visibly relieved.</p> <p>It’s funny how things work out. Now 76, Stamp had a fantastic 1960s, during which he starred in a handful of imperishable classics (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=799zAk0kXk0\">Billy Budd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKOwXAMyFtM\">Ken Loach’s Poor Cow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCGVIg1ksYU\">Pasolini’s Theorem</a>) and consorted with some of the era’s most beautiful women (Julie Christie, Jean Shrimpton, Brigitte Bardot). His career fell off a cliff at the start of the 1970s, the drought ending with an improbable offer to play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUORL-bvwA0\">General Zod in the first two Superman movies</a>. A peripatetic revival followed, with occasional juicy roles (The Hit, Wall Street, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV-Zzasrky8\">The Adventures of Priscilla</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHgz_eurVnE\">Song for Marion</a>) alternating with pay-the-bills Hollywood (Young Guns, Elektra, Wanted). Retro fetishism started in 1999 with the Steven Soderbergh-directed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h_iD1us304\">The Limey</a>, in which Stamp played a Get Carter-ish avenging gangster, and has continued to the present day, with Stamp currently lionised by another 60s-fetishising film-maker, Tim Burton, with roles in Big Eyes (as a snooty art critic) and the yet-to-be-completed Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children.</p> <p>But cinema has a habit of folding back on itself; this week sees the reissue of one of those imperishable 1960s films, Far From the Madding Crowd, an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel, in which Stamp plays the coldly raffish Sergeant Troy opposite Julie Christie’s Bathsheba. Spruced-up and spring-cleaned, and just less than half a century old, Far From the Madding Crowd is something else: they really don’t make them like this any more. Almost three hours long, smeared with mud and sheep dung in its grimly realistic recreation of early 19th-century Dorset, and benefiting from performances from actors at the top of their games, it glows on the screen exactly the way it must have when first released in 1967. At the time, however, it was considered a disaster: poor reviews, especially in the US, and a general inability to see past the with-it celebrity personas of Stamp and Christie, translated into underwhelming box-office and a severe career misstep for its director, John Schlesinger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGWUt0wgHg0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGWUt0wgHg0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>These days, Stamp is sanguine about the film, which has regained some cultural currency with the impending release of another adaptation, featuring Carey Mulligan in the Julie Christie role and Tom Sturridge in Stamp’s. “It was the first really commercial project I got involved with, and I was rather shocked by the reaction. I thought it had everything.”</p> <p>Stamp goes on to explain – with what I come to realise is a habitual forthright honesty – that the experience was somewhat ruined by the fact he didn’t respect, or like, Schlesinger. “He didn’t strike me as a guy who was particularly interested in film. Plus I wasn’t his first choice: he really wanted Jon Voight. He wasn’t exactly hostile, but he really didn’t help me. I was working on my own, really.” Fortunately, says Stamp, he bonded with the director of photography, Nicolas Roeg (who would, of course, have a spectacular directorial career himself), and the two would go off after shooting had officially ended for the day to work on sequences of their own. That’s where the celebrated sword-demonstration scene came from, in which Stamp waggles his not entirely unsymbolic weapon to Christie’s squealing delight. “I’ll say this for Schlesinger, when he got in the cutting room and realised he had all this extra footage, he used it. He understood it then. But I didn’t have a lot of time for him.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f2cdc8aac1a03f8a746d9ee7121c67f1978a8fd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426182363973/5a5fd10f-a65a-4531-b47b-fc0ae2889603-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Comeback … Stamp in The Limey (1999).\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comeback … Stamp in The Limey (1999).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Artisan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liking – or not liking – his directors is one of Stamp’s big themes: joining Schlesinger on the naughty step are Ken Loach (“too political”), Joseph Losey (“no sense of humour”) and Pasolini (“didn’t talk to me”). On the plus side, though, are Fellini (“changed my life”), William Wyler (“really bonded with him”) and Burton (“a wonderful movie-maker”). Fraught though his on-set relationships may have been, Stamp says he never let it get to him. “I don’t have to get on with a director. What I’m concerned with is what goes into the camera.”</p> <p>This, it seems, is something that didn’t extend to his Madding Crowd co-star, Christie, of whom he still speaks fondly and with a certain amount of awe. Their relationship – initiated after Stamp saw her on a magazine cover holding a submachine gun shortly after he’d shot to fame in 1962 with his first film lead, Billy Budd – has become one of the 60s most mythologised (not least because of the Terry-and-Julie namecheck on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J3gX47rHGg\">the Kinks’ Waterloo Sunset</a>). It fizzled out just a year later, as Christie was experiencing her own star-making moment with Schlesinger’s second feature, Billy Liar. By the time Madding Crowd came round – the only film they made together – Stamp was seeing the model Jean Shrimpton, and Christie, with an Oscar under her belt for another Schlesinger film, Darling, was living with artist Don Bessant.</p> <p>“It was before we were both famous: we met, and we had a romance. That was it. When I got my first movie, I knew it was my destiny to be a film actor, so that became my motivation in life. On the set, the fact that she had been my girlfriend just never came up. I saw her as Bathsheba, the character she was playing, who all the men in the film fell in love with. But it wasn’t hard, with somebody like Julie.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1635a96c9fe2cb40f9d6277e94791fa36b8f1f41\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426182161753/13a6f35e-ae11-4b52-972f-e5fd6d83145e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Stamp with Julie Christie in Far From the Madding Crowd.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stamp with Julie Christie in Far From the Madding Crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The more Stamp talks, the more you realise that not only is all that face-of-the-60s stuff well behind him, but that it also does him something of a disservice. With the directness of the autodidact, and the lack of embarrassment of someone who, on some level, is past caring, he rambles happily on, unconsciously emphasising his central preoccupation as a knowledge-seeker, an experience-ferreter, and someone who appears to enjoy being carried along by life.</p> <p>He ended up doing Theorem, he says, because he bumped into childhood crush Silvana Mangano, star of Bitter Rice, on a Rome street (“I couldn’t believe she was there in the flesh”) and she suggested him for the role. “Pasolini told me: ‘A stranger arrives, makes love to everybody, and leaves. This is your part.’ I said: ‘I can do that!’” He explains how Fellini introduced him to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti\">Indian mystic Krishnamurti</a> in the late 60s (“the first great enlightened man I’d ever met”), and he ended up doing the classic hippie trail: yoga, vegetarianism, living on an ashram. Working with Loach was “fascinating”: “No script, improvisation, in front of camera, making it up. That was a big event for me.” Pasolini, he says, startled him by filming with a secret camera: “I realised he was trying to get something from me when I wasn’t performing. He wanted a kind of being-ness.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55f054bc44e9ce1ada93de6ca18a0aed06b6d718\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426182257762/b380e0dc-0843-47ca-8d22-9847ca4b9b19-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Stamp in Billy Budd (1962).\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stamp in Billy Budd (1962).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Allied Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if he is prone to slipping into actorly psychobabble (“it’s hard for me to put a lot of my stuff into words,” he confesses), by any measure Stamp has come a long, long way. His childhood – first in the rough London district of Bow, and then in the somewhat gentler surrounds of Plaistow – evolved into a determined effort to escape a traditional working-class background and become part of the then-novel phenomenon of the non-posh actor. Drama school elocution lessons drove away his cockney accent, though he briefly drops into his original voice to illustrate a point – “frew vair” – and you suddenly get a glimpse of who he might have been if the acting bug hadn’t taken hold. (In the 1980s, he wrote two entertaining books about the time, Stamp Album and Coming Attractions, which stop abruptly at the moment Peter Ustinov cast him in Billy Budd.)</p> <p>Somewhat improbably, he ended up sharing a flat with Michael Caine, while both were jobbing actors looking for their big break. Caine, eight years older than Stamp, was another guru, his “master” – though now, he says resignedly, they haven’t spoken for 40 years. “We just went different ways. I can understand it: in many ways he was much more mature than me.” Though he isn’t too sad to acidly observe that Caine’s career didn’t exactly live up to the original ideals that he had impressed on Stamp. “Caine gave me all my early values, like making sure you were doing good stuff, waiting for the right things – then as soon as he got away he did exactly the opposite. Went from one movie to another.”</p> <p>But Stamp sounds still baffled as to exactly why his 60s hot streak ended so abruptly. “It’s a mystery to me. I was in my prime. When the 1960s ended, I just ended with it. I remember my agent telling me: ‘They are all looking for a young Terence Stamp.’ And I thought: ‘I <em>am</em> young.’ I was 31, 32. I couldn’t believe it. It was tough to wake up in the morning, and the phone not ringing. I thought: this can’t be happening now, it’s only just started. The day-to-day thing was awful, and I couldn’t live with it. So I bought a round-the-world ticket and left.” His fallow 70s period culminated with his extended India trip and it was while he was there, in 1976, that he got the celebrated telegram addressed to “Clarence Stamp”, offering him the role in Superman. (“I was on the plane the next evening.”)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02656cc14f554157a2930f9988f62123c4d93459\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426182049807/c51fc533-c998-4ec2-8506-9e8ce477a645-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Stamp gets throttled by Christopher Reeve in Superman II (1980).\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stamp gets throttled by Christopher Reeve in Superman II (1980).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Playing Zod, it turns out, engineered a mind-shift, a third-act transformation that allowed him to reclaim his career. “During that time away from the screen, I had transmuted myself. I no longer saw myself as a leading man. What had happened inside of me enabled me to take the role, and not feel embarassed or depressed about playing the villain. I just decided I was a character actor now and I can do anything.”</p> <p>These days, Stamp mostly plays grandfathers and pensioners (scoring a rare lead role recently, opposite Gemma Arterton and Vanessa Redgrave, in the surprisingly moving pensioner-choir yarn Song for Marion, for which Stamp drew on memories of his emotionally closed-off stoker dad Tom), and seems happy with his lot. He doesn’t own a home, still living what he calls the “stroller-player” life. “Where I came from, to own a house was something unreal – so when I had money, I gave houses to everyone: my parents, my aunt. But I never felt I needed to own one.” Not everything in the garden is rosy: his first and only marriage to an Australian pharmacist 35 years his junior, ended in 2008 after six years, and his brother Chris, co-manager of the Who, died three years ago.</p> <p>And there is the question of “the work”. For someone so well known, so comprehensively identified with a tremendous cinematic era, Stamp’s output is notable for its idiosyncrasy, its seeming lack of direction and random switchback nature; it certainly has none of the strategic populist cunning of Caine’s. “I don’t have any ambitions. I’m always amazed there’s another job, I’m always very happy. I’ve had bad experiences and things that didn’t work out; my love for film sometimes diminishes but then it just resurrects itself. I never have to gee myself up, or demand a huge wage to get out of bed in the morning. I’ve done crap, because sometimes I didn’t have the rent. But when I’ve got the rent, I want to do the best I can.”</p> <p>As a life manual, it sounds great. Meanwhile, everyone should go and see Far From the Madding Crowd. It, and Stamp, are brilliant: a fitting testament to a remarkable career.</p> <p><em>Far From the Madding Crowd is released in the UK today</em></p>","headline":"Terence Stamp: ‘I was in my prime, but when the 60s ended, I ended with it’","trailText":"He was the star of some of the decade’s most memorable films – and dated some of its most beautiful women.

of indie biopic Midnight Rider being jailed earlier this week, has written <a href=\"https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/open-letter-from-elizabeth-jones_3-12-15.pdf\">an open letter</a> chastising the Hollywood Reporter for publishing her daughter’s “gruesome” autopsy report.</p> <p>The US trade paper posted details of the autopsy online on Wednesday, before toning down their content later that day. Jones was killed in February 2014 in an accident on an active railroad bridge high over the Altamaha River in Wayne County, Georgia. Director Randall Miller become the first film-maker to be jailed for an on-set fatality in the US on Monday after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass. </p> <p>The fatality occurred on the first day of shooting for Midnight Rider, a biopic of the southern rock musician Gregg Allman. Jones, 27, died when the train hit a metal frame bed that had been placed on the track as part of a dream sequence featuring actor William Hurt as Allman. Her death has galvanised safety campaigners in Hollywood, with a number of initiatives since introduced to improve conditions and encourage whistleblowers to report rogue operators.<br />Miller was sentenced to two years behind bars plus eight years of probation and a $20,000 (£13,250) fine on Monday after changing his plea to guilty in a deal which saw his wife and film-making partner Jody Savin walk free from court.</p> <p>Jones, who with her husband Richard has been at the forefront of work to improve safety on film sets since her daughter’s death, said she was “totally stunned” and “totally appalled” that the Hollywood Reporter had published the autopsy. Her letter is republished below.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To The Hollywood Reporter:</p> <p>I am totally stunned, I am totally appalled, and I am ashamed of the callous reporter who leaked the autopsy report of our daughter for the world to see. Although the grace and beauty of Sarah Elizabeth Jones outshines the deprecating words on a page, no one, NO ONE, should be so low as to think this gruesome report is newsworthy.</p> <p>To the reporter, where is your own honor? Is your desire to climb the rungs of a career ladder so important that you infringe upon the privacy and civility of a family whose daughter was tragically hit by a train? Is our pain of losing a daughter not enough that you feel the need to exploit Sarah’s dignity?</p> <p>Shame on the tabloid that published the article, that it should be so crude and selfish for readership numbers? Does that not put you in the same category of selfishness as the movie producers who thought it was ok to steal a shot?</p> <p>Look at the lives of those you have harmed by publishing detail by detail, Sarah’s autopsy report. Do you not realize the pain and sadness of the Jones family? Do you not have an inkling of decency? Did the thought even occur to you that perhaps Sarah’s family did not choose to remember her by the poignant description of her remains?</p> <p>It is my hope for you that you will discover one goes much further and higher with greater respect and honor than sensationalism that is harmful to not only the one you are reporting on, but the surrounding community as well.</p> <p>It is my hope for you that you will find a place in the world of journalism that will not allow such indecency be a motivating facet of readership.</p> <p>It is my hope that the ones who are offended by this report will speak out and let The Hollywood Reporter know their thoughts.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth McCartha Jones, Sarah’s Mother</em></p> </blockquote>","headline":"Mother of Midnight Rider victim Sarah Jones shames

the film online for free next week, in an unusual bid to raise funding for the second in a planned trilogy of female-driven horror films.</p> <p>Lyle, billed as “a lesbian Rosemary’s Baby”, stars indie darling Gaby Hoffmann as a pregnant lesbian whose first child dies while she is pregnant with her second, causing the character to snap out of her idyllic life in an extreme way. “She sort of goes into an uncertain state of mind – a paranoid fantasy world trying to figure out what happened,” Hoffmann told The Guardian.</p> <p>Stewart Thorndike, a New York-based filmmaker and friend of Hoffmann’s, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/gaby-hoffmann-the-eloise-of-the-chelsea-hotel.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">wrote the Leah character for Hoffmann</a>. Thorndike and producer Alex Acharfman decided to post the film online for free on 4 August to support Thorndike’s trifecta of female-driven horror films. Lyle will be online for the duration of a Kickstarter campaign that seeks to raise money for The Putney School, the second film in Stewart’s trio, which is about a haunted TED talk.<br /></p> <p>Hoffmann spoke to the Guardian from a television shoot in Los Angeles for the Amazon series <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/jill-soloway-on-her-amazon-pilot-transparent.html\">Transparent</a>, a comedy-drama which follows a family after the patriarch comes out as transgender. It’s the latest project for a one-time child star (Field of Dreams, Sleepless in Seattle) who as an adult has cemented herself as a classic independent film star with roles on television series Girls and films like Crystal Fairy and The Magic Cactus.<br /></p> <p>Hoffmann said she last saw a horror film when she was a kid, but chose the role because of the challenges it presented for her as an actress.<br /></p> <p>“I’m not that interested in horror films, I never have been. I don’t quite get the appeal,” Hoffmann said. “But as an actress, it seemed like a really, fun, juicy role to take on and it really was – I had a lot of fun making it, certainly.”<br /></p> <p>Most of the film was shot in one building, in five days. “You’re sort of in that world 24/7,” Hoffmann said. “You’re living breathing, eating it. It’s exhausting, but I kind of enjoy working that way, because you sort of merge with this false reality that you are trying to create.”<br /></p> <p>While Hoffmann enjoys the intense, problem-solving environment low budget films offer, she’s open to good storytelling on any level.<br /></p> <p>“What I prefer is good writing and smart people,” Hoffmann said. “Wherever that is found, and that is found all over the place in terms of budget, that’s where I tend to want to be.”</p>","headline":"Lyle: the 'lesbian Rosemary's Baby' to be streamed for free online","trailText":"Horror comedy stars Gaby Hoffmann as pregnant woman who goes into a paranoid fantasy when her first child dies","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406739355511/9da36277-b3cc-4fb3-bf2a-7a5c058ea767-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"427","commentable":"true","byline":"Amanda Holpuch","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-02T13:00:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/30/lyle-horror-comedy-gaby-hoffman-online-free","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/30/lyle-horror-comedy-gaby-hoffman-online-free","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/amanda-holpuch","webTitle":"Amanda Holpuch","r2ContributorId":"50290","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/25/1411659882620/Amanda-Holpuch.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/25/1411659899648/Amanda-Holpuch-R.png","firstName":"amanda","lastName":"holpuch","twitterHandle":"holpuch","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Amanda is a reporter at the Guardian.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/amanda-holpuch","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"_no_ids","relation":"main","type":"embed","assets":[{"type":"embed","file":"http://vimeo.com/101746779","typeData":{"source":"Vimeo","description":"This is \"LYLE trailer // FREE on LYLEmovie.com // AUGUST 4th\" by Stewart Thorndike on Vimeo, the home for high quality videos and the people who love them.","height":"259","credit":"Stewart Thorndike","caption":"‘I’m not that interested in horror films, I never have been.

One thing was different, though: we didn&apos;t go to the movies. This holiday weekend took a 44% dip in American ticket sales from 2013. If you adjust for inflation it was the worst 4 July weekend since 1987.</p> <p>The capability to stream TV and movies (legally and otherwise) is reminding studios that their product needs to be enticing enough to warrant the time and expense of a theater visit. Last weekend&apos;s openers Tammy and Deliver Us From Evil were pretty much reviled by most critics. With the summer halfway done, is there anything good on the horizon?</p> <p>Unfortunately, the answer is: not much. It isn&apos;t all bleak, but compared to the summers of our youth (and it isn&apos;t just nostalgia: the 80s and 90s really knew how to pack a season of blockbusters) it&apos;s a desert out there. Below are the very few oases for filmgoers between now and Labor Day, with US release dates listed.</p> <h2>Big movies that will be good</h2> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film\">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a> (11 July)</b><br /></p> <p>“Who asked for this?” I snarked as I entered the theater during 2011&apos;s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. “Buck, I will avenge thee!” I wept as the film ended. Rise began a little hokey, and no one is going to accuse Freida Pinto of giving a good performance, but take state-of-the-art motion capturing, ambiguous moral culpability, a few bananas and you have a thrilling action film. The sequel, Dawn, takes place after society&apos;s downfall as Caesar (once again a computer-enhanced Andy Serkis) leads his simian armies through war and peace. The film, like some of the original Apes movies, mixes intellect and allegory with adventure and special effects. A number of critics have already applauded Matt Reeves, best known for directing Cloverfield, for delivering an Empire Strikes Back-level entertainment for this new trilogy. (Yep: the third instalment has already been greenlit.)</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155488/guardians-of-the-galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> (1 August)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIQ2-PZBC8\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LIQ2-PZBC8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is Marvel Studio head Kevin Feige&apos;s victory lap. When The Avengers became the third highest grossing picture ever, the bean counters at Disney shrugged and said, sure, take something from comic book lore out for a spin. Thus we get director James Gunn, whose last film was the anti-superhero picture Super, tackling the weirdest collection of deep cut oddities in Marvel canon. Guardians of the Galaxy features Bradley Cooper as a gun-toting, talking raccoon, and Vin Diesel as a sentient tree creature from Planet X. This more resembles the 80s space adventure The Ice Pirates than Captain America. Chris Pratt as the rogueish leader and Zoe Saldana (green this time, not blue) zip around in cool ships saving the day, zinging each other with jokes. I must confess, I&apos;ve been keeping my head in the sand on this one, trying to avoid too much specific info. I love nerdy superhero sci-fi, and once I saw the soundtrack was wall-to-wall 70s pop (10cc! Jackson 5! The Raspberries!) I cut myself off from watching any clips. A critic can still be a fan.</p> <h2>Big movies that will be dumb but maybe fun (Maybe)</h2> <p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(2014_film)\">Hercules</a> (25 July)</b></p> <p>This movie will be bad. Director Brett Ratner is basically the poor man&apos;s Michael Bay. But Dwayne Johnson is a charisma machine. If I said to you I didn&apos;t want to see him shirtlessly accomplishing his heroic twelve labors I&apos;d be a liar. Plus, this movie co-stars Ian McShane, who is either Al Swearengin or Emperor Palpatine. I get the two confused, but they&apos;re both great, so whichever it is, we win.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/\">Lucy</a> (25 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVt32qoyhi0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My anticipation of Lucy is much the same as Hercules. Director Luc Besson&apos;s name on a project has lately become the kiss of death for actual quality, but he does tend to deliver a certain kind of good time. Lucy features Scarlett Johansson running around Taipei making time stop and people fly across the room, and she probably wears sexy wigs and says quotable things in that deep voice of hers, before shots of a gorgeous stunt double spins around like a human top. Listen: I live in New York City and by 25 July it is so disgustingly hot that the air conditioning of a movie theater is a very real necessity. Watching ScoJo beat the crap out of baddies is more than adequate accompaniment for a good session of climate control.<br /></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924435/\">Let&apos;s Be Cops</a> (13 August)</b></p> <p>Damon Wayans and Jake Johnson play two dinguses who dress like cops for a costume party and discover that people treat them with respect. So they continue to pretend to be cops. Shenanigans ensue. Any premise this simple is just a little bit genius. I confess to laughing at the trailer.</p> <h2>Small movies that will be great</h2> <p>Listen up, you rubes. You don&apos;t have to just see what the rich monsters in Hollywood force-feed you through the studio system. What about the rich monsters producing lower-budget films? Keep your eyes peeled for these titles coming out during the second part of the summer. </p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/\">Boyhood</a> (11 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/08/boyhood-richard-linklater-ellar-coltrane-interview-video\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2121591\"                data-video-name=\"Richard Linklater and Ellar Coltrane on Boyhood: 'You're collaborating with an unknown future' – video interviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486226273/Boyhood-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-441294572\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486222754/Boyhood-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood/140704Boyhood.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Something of a minor miracle. Director Richard Linklater shot this movie in small doses over 12 years, slowly chronicling a young boy&apos;s maturation. It&apos;s a big movie made up of small moments, genuinely touching and wholly unpredictable. Get on the bandwagon now, as every critic worth his or her salt will list it on their end-of-year top 10.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2027140/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Mood Indigo</a> (18 July)<br /></b></p> <p>Arguably the most French movie ever made, Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou are quite adorable as fairy tale lovers in Michel Gondry&apos;s adaptation of Boris Vian&apos;s Froth on the Daydream. This highly energetic picture isn&apos;t for everyone – but if you like your whimsical magical realism done up in an antic, extra-crafty style, this may just win your heart.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2870756/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Magic in the Moonlight</a> (25 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwbwKURvm0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAwbwKURvm0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest from Woody Allen is something of a small gem, with Colin Firth and Emma Stone sauntering through a 1930s-era Côte d&apos;Azur, saying witty things about magic and love and faith. Many of Allen&apos;s films have been set in an earlier era, few actually feel this much like an actual relic. In this case, it is meant as a high compliment.<br /></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234003/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Calvary</a> (1 August)</b></p> <p>Writer-director John Michael McDonough and actor Brendan Gleeson re-team for this funny yet melancholy look at the proverbial “good Irish priest” and a small village of idiosyncratic characters – one of which has pledged to murder Gleeson in a week&apos;s time. Chris O&apos;Down, Domhnall Gleeson, Isaach de Bankolé and Aidan Gillen co-star.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194328/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Finding Fela!</a> (1 August)</b></p> <p>Director Alex Gibney pumps out documentaries like Wendy&apos;s chicken sandwiches, but there&apos;s no possible way to screw this up. Even if the talking heads are a snooze, any archival footage of Fela Kuti performing will make this a must-see.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605717/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Frank</a> (15 August)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/may/07/frank-domhnall-gleeson-jon-ronson-video-interview\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2088400\"                data-video-name=\"Frank star Domhnall Gleeson and co-writer Jon Ronson: 'We're not very forgiving of transgressions any more' – video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/7/1399468086126/Frank-star-Domhnall-Glees-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-436250522\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/7/1399468084591/Frank-star-Domhnall-Glees-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/07/140507Frank-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/07/140507Frank_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/07/140507Frank_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/07//140507Frank.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/07/140507Frank/140507Frank.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Loosely based on essayist Jon Ronson&apos;s youthful exploits as a keyboard player for Frank Sidebottom&apos;s band, this surreal rock comedy featuring Michael Fassbender in an enormous papier mâché head is a touching and sincere look at mental illness and the dangers of perceived genius. The last five minutes make for quite possibly the best finish in any film this year.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2581244/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Life After Beth</a> (15 August)</b></p> <p>Aubrey Plaza deserves to be a bigger star, and maybe this horror-comedy is the one that will make it happen. Dane DeHaan, John C Reilly, Molly Shannon and a lot of other people you recognize co-star in this story of a wiseacre girl who becomes a zombie. (Now&apos;s when you reread the title and realize its genius.)</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">The Congress</a> (29 August)</b></p> <p>Israeli director Ari Folman&apos;s follow-up to the politically charged Waltz With Bashir is a strange mix of Hollywood satire and psychedelic sci-fi mind trip. It begins as a satire on advancements in cinematic technology, then morphs down an animated rabbit hole of delusion and addiction. It&apos;s also virtually impossible to sum up, but if you like far-out “head” films you&apos;ll miss this one at your peril.</p>","headline":"Summer film preview: what do we have to look forward to?","trailText":"With the summer halfway done, we take a look at upcoming releases from Michel Gondry to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/8/1404828277205/756a353c-7883-4ab6-82f6-142f4a27736a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1350","commentable":"true","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-11T10:15:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/08/us-summer-movies-preview-planet-of-apes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/08/us-summer-movies-preview-planet-of-apes","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","webTitle":"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/lucy","webTitle":"Lucy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lucy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lucy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/boyhood","webTitle":"Boyhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/boyhood","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/michel-gondry","webTitle":"Michel Gondry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-gondry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/michel-gondry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/magic-in-the-moonlight","webTitle":"Magic in the Moonlight","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/magic-in-the-moonlight","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/magic-in-the-moonlight","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/calvary","webTitle":"Calvary","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/calvary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/calvary","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/frank","webTitle":"Frank","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frank","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/frank","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

This matter-of-fact indie romance highlights the pro-life message that Hollywood has been feeding its audience for decades</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/19/sundance-film-festival-2014-obvious-child-review\">Obvious Child is a movie about a girl who gets an abortion</a> and lives happily ever after. In the real world, this is a familiar story – an obvious story, even. Thousands of women get abortions every year, feel fine about it, then move on with their lives. It’s a “big issue” for society that is sometimes, really, not that big of a deal. Yet in films and on TV, this is still largely uncharted, controversial territory. Though at first glance Obvious Child might seem like just a cute indie rom-com, its release has highlighted the pro-life messages that Hollywood has been feeding audiences for decades.</p> <p>Obvious Child was written and directed by Gillian Robespierre and stars Jenny Slate (from Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation). Slate plays Donna, a 28-year-old stand-up comedian in New York who, after being dumped by her boyfriend, sleeps with a guy who is not her type – a preppy Mr Nice. After what she thought was a one-night-stand turns into an accidental pregnancy, the story explores the difficult, and at times comic, reality of dealing with an abortion.</p> <p>In Hollywood, even in the ‘liberal’ world of independent film, unwanted pregnancies usually result in the woman deciding to have the child. Last month, on The Colbert Report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/apr/04/ellen-page-interview\">Juno star Ellen Page</a> argued against the idea that the film has a pro-life message: <strong>“</strong>It’s very much a pro-choice film because Juno explores her options, she thinks about it, she goes to an abortion clinic.<strong>”</strong> But I think most would disagree. Despite Juno not being morally opposed to abortion, the message was clear: she couldn’t go through with it and ultimately felt it was a better decision to have the kid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cabI_CzXGD4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cabI_CzXGD4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Obvious Child doesn’t do that familiar heartwarming thing. Instead, many women will relate to the sarcastic realism with which Donna handles her pregnancy. And while some of the comedy in Obvious Child falls flat, the film’s message is something to be applauded: having an abortion is not likely to ruin your life, or even be an awful experience; in fact, it might just all work out fine<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In light of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/arizona-abortion-restrictions-lawsuit-challenged\">many abortion restrictions</a> and new anti-abortion laws being passed across America, which are jeopardizing women’s reproductive rights, and in some states setting back the situation of women by decades, the movie’s release feels timely. One of the its best scenes is a conversation between Donna and her friend Nellie (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/gaby-hoffmann-child-star-who-broke-the-rules\">Gaby Hoffmann</a>), who has previously had an abortion herself. When Donna asks Nellie about her experience, she answers matter-of-factly: “I never regret it.” Later, when Donna is debating whether to tell her one-night-stand about the pregnancy, Nellie is adamant that it’s Donna’s body, and therefore Donna’s decision to make. She adds, in what may be the film’s strongest line, “We already live in a patriarchal society where a group of weird old white men in robes get to legislate our cunts.”</p> <p>No sane woman is excited about getting an abortion. It is something you hope never to have to do. And yet, speaking from experience, an abortion can also result in a wonderful feeling of relief for someone who is not ready to be a parent. When Donna has gone through the procedure, there is a scene that perfectly illustrates that complicated mix of feelings. Sitting in a room full of women in their 20s and 30s, all wearing pink hospital gowns, Donna looks rough. She turns to the woman beside her and they share a quick, genuine smile – they are both grateful.</p> <p>• Comments have been reopened to time with this film’s Australian release</p>","headline":"'Abortion rom-com' Obvious Child is important – because it's so ordinary","trailText":" This matter-of-fact indie romance highlights the pro-life message that Hollywood has been feeding its audience for decades","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402604265160/92ad268f-e4b1-40a1-9890-f9ad3b25498e-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"601","commentable":"true","byline":"Karley Sciortino","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-13T00:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/obvious-child-rom-com-jenny-slate-ordinary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/12/obvious-child-rom-com-jenny-slate-ordinary","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/abortion","webTitle":"Abortion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/abortion","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/women","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/karley-sciortino","webTitle":"Karley Sciortino","r2ContributorId":"62943","firstName":"karley","lastName":"sciortino","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Karley Sciortino is a New York-based writer, filmmaker and actress, and author of the blog Slutever.

Stuart Heritage picks the best suggestions and imagines what they might entail<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Last week, fuelled by the prospect of watching a real film called Zombeavers, we set you <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/14/can-you-come-up-with-a-better-b-movie-title-than-zombeavers\">an impossible task</a>. Could you, an average layperson, come up with a B-movie title even better than that? You didn’t let us down. In total, we received over 600 entries. Well done, everyone.</p> <p>Obviously, not all of them were great. About a third of them were slightly lazy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/113997/snakes.on.a.plane\">Snakes on a Plane</a> rip-offs (including but not limited to Goat on a Boat, Lambs on a Tram and Komodo Dragons on a Funicular Railway). Then, in true Guardian comment section fashion, there was also a smattering of borderline-incomprehensible political screeds shoehorned into catastrophic anti-puns, such as The Bourne Liar (starring Barack Obama), Attack of the Farrage and Cleggiband: Return of the Economy Killers. And then there were those that actually had promise. I now present the best five, along with the plots I think they deserve. If these are yours, congratulations. You win nothing.</p> <h2>Bearacuda! (as suggested by naughtyorator)</h2> <p>Realistically, what let <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U87zVkIXNI0http://\">Sharktopus</a> down was the fact that both sharks and octopuses are limited to water. Not so here. Bearacuda – the half-bear/half-fish result of a failed Russian experiment – can roam both land and sea, taking out scores of bikini-wearing minor actresses wherever they happen to be. Acclaimed sexy scientist Debbie Gibson leads a ragtag army of volunteers, equipped with harpoons and pots of honey, in a desperate effort to subdue Bearacuda before it kills again. Even though, in retrospect, she could have just waited until winter and stabbed it to death in its sleep.</p> <h2>The ExorShihTzu (as suggested by badcompany)</h2> <p>There’s a case for making The ExorShihTzu a film about a dog who gets possessed. But wouldn’t it be so much better to make the priests dogs instead? The Jason Miller priest could be a puppy, and the Max von Sydow priest could be an older, more experienced dog. In fact, why not just re-release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/138749/exorcist\">The Exorcist</a>, but with those actors digitally erased and replaced with a couple of dogs? One of them could be voiced by Bruce Willis. It’d be fun. </p> <h2>Tiramisunami (as suggested by Blufog)</h2> <p>My favourite suggestion of all. Imagine – a Roland Emmerich-style disaster movie, but shot on a shoestring, starring a bunch of forgotten popstars from the 1980s and exclusively about pudding. A Russian experiment to drive Italy out of the cake business goes horribly awry, sending a 500ft shockwave of mascarpone and ladyfingers hurtling around the globe. After Micronesia is wiped off the face of the Earth entirely, acclaimed sexy scientist Shannen Doherty unveils her ambitious plans to build the world’s biggest spoon before the tiramisunami hits the eastern seaboard and makes a horrible sloppy mess out of the Statue of Liberty.</p> <h2>Vole-cano (as suggested by ID1300995)</h2> <p>Acclaimed sexy scientist Tara Reid has trouble convincing the UN of her latest theory – that science was wrong all along and that the Earth’s core is actually packed with voles – until a fissure opens in Toronto and sprays everyone with boiling hot voles. The president suggests blocking the hole with a big cork, but Reid knows better than this. This is why, backed by a ragtag gang of volunteers, she embarks on a life-or-death mission to the centre of the Earth to reason with the malevolent Vole King (voiced by Screech from Saved by the Bell).</p> <h2>We Fought a Zoo (as suggested by Stevenjameshyde)</h2> <p>Catastrophe. A failed Russian experiment has somehow unlocked all the cages of whichever zoo is nearest to the middle of Toronto, and now the animals have their minds set on bloody revenge. The mayor wants to use machine guns, but those no-good environmentalists won’t stop protesting. Meanwhile, retired heavyweight champion Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is on the brink of alcoholic suicide when he receives a mysterious text message – would he be willing to try and punch six tigers and an elephant unconscious with his bare hands and become a hero in the process? Note: for budgetary reasons, the action will be limited to one scene of Carlton kicking a furry snood into a well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/14/can-you-come-up-with-a-better-b-movie-title-than-zombeavers\">• Full list of your suggestions here</a></p>","headline":"After Zombeavers, five more monster movies we'd like to see","trailText":"We asked readers to come up with titles for new B-movies that could rival the unimprovable Zombeavers. <b>Stuart Heritage</b> picks the best suggestions and imagines what they might entail<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809156207/c2986e69-f458-445a-97af-5aac16d424b8-140x84.png","wordcount":"691","commentable":"true","byline":"Stuart Heritage","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/19/zombeavers-five-more-monster-movies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/19/zombeavers-five-more-monster-movies","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-91d5da5e-2825-4e68-8392-034172d1b16a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809155299/6ca971ad-b505-4051-84f5-cd5368bd84a8-220x132.png","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809155299/6ca971ad-b505-4051-84f5-cd5368bd84a8-220x132.png","source":"YouTube","altText":"Still from Zombeavers trailer","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: YouTube","caption":"Beaver damnation … a still from the Zombeavers trailer.

But the audiences at Toronto, which kicks off  on Thursday, will be clapping eyes on not one but two Adam Sandler movies: The Cobbler and Men, Women &amp; Children. That's the same Adam Sandler who played the dual roles of an advertising executive and his shrill twin sister in Jack and Jill, not to mention an Israeli commando turned Manhattan hairdresser (\"I just want to make people silky-smooth!\") in You Don't Mess with the Zohan.</p><p>However, this is a tale of two Sandlers. There is the goofy 47-year-old actor and writer whose sleepy chipmunk face and everyman demeanour give no hint of his estimated $300m (£180m)fortune – nor the $25m price-tag (including producer's fee) that comes with his participation on a movie.</p><p>His company, Happy Madison Productions, takes its name from a hybrid of two of his earliest hits (the 1995 back-to-school comedy Billy Madison and its golfing follow-up Happy Gilmore) and features in its logo the face of his late father, Stanley Sandler, a Brooklyn electrical engineer from Russian immigrant stock.</p><p>Recent successes for the company include Sandler's two Grown Ups movies, which between them earned more than $500m worldwide, as well as projects starring proteges such as Kevin James, whose Paul Blart: Mall Cop grossed $183m on a meagre $26m budget. All of which must make for an exceedingly Happy Madison.</p><p>The other Sandler is more unorthodox. Ever since he departed briefly from his own lucrative brand to star in Paul Thomas Anderson's skew-whiff rom-com Punch-Drunk Love in 2002, he has shown an occasional willingness to tamper and toy with his persona. In that film, he played a milquetoast whose rage issues emerge when he is exploited in a phone-sex scam. Perhaps it is the proximity of comedy and aggression (comics like to \"slay\" or \"kill\" their audiences, after all) that makes it strangely appropriate to see Sandler showing a more serious and volatile side.</p><p>Such an offbeat endeavour can't expect to enjoy much crossover potential with the Sandler fan base. But it does display a sense of adventure and dexterity seen in established comics chafing against their image.</p><p>Bill Murray co-wrote and starred in a 1984 adaptation of Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge – in the same year as Ghostbusters no less. Steve Martin couldn't have found a sharper contrast to his own loopy vaudevillian vehicles than the lead in the grim 1981 film version of Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven.</p><p>Similarly, Sandler proved in Punch-Drunk Love, and in other complex parts that pepper his CV (such as Reign Over Me, where he was a man who lost his family in the World Trade Centre attacks), that there is more to him than slapstick and fart jokes.</p><p>Early signs suggest the films unveiled in Toronto will enhance those complexities. In The Cobbler, Sandler plays a lonely shoe repairman who discovers that he can enter the lives of his customers via a magical heirloom – that he can know them by walking in their shoes. And in Men, Women &amp; Children, directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air), he and Emma Thompson are part of an ensemble cast portraying people whose relationships are affected by the internet. The Sandler faithful might want to sit these ones out and wait for Grown Ups 3.</p><p>Sandler earned his stripes in the early 1990s on the evergreen US sketch show Saturday Night Live. The director Dennis Dugan wanted to cast him in Brain Donors, a 1992 comedy based on the Marx brothers' A Night at the Opera. \"I thought Adam was terrifically funny, interesting and personable,\" Dugan says. \"I brought him in for four auditions but I just couldn't get the producers to say yes.\" A few years later, Sandler remembered Dugan's persistence and hired him to direct Happy Gilmore. \"He's completely loyal. He'll even stay loyal to people who aren't as good team-mates as you'd like them to be. That's his personality.\"</p><p>Dugan has directed eight of Sandler's movies, including the gay-themed I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Just Go With It (co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman) and both Grown Ups pictures. But as far back as their initial collaboration, Dugan spotted an intriguing undercurrent in the star.</p><p>\"When we made Happy Gilmore I said to his agent and manager: 'He doesn't have to be just a goofball. He's got real heart and soul – he's a real actor. So we can go with the Pauly Shore version of this, or the Michael Keaton version.' They said they wanted the Michael Keaton version, and I did too.\"</p><p>Sandler became a one-man phenomenon; each hit outstripped the last. The Wedding Singer, in which he was a jilted groom performing 1980s pop hits and falling for Drew Barrymore, raked in $123m worldwide in 1998 and made a convincing case for him as a rom-com lead. In the same year, he was a nerd tormented by football players in The Waterboy ($190m). Both of those were eclipsed by his parenthood comedy Big Daddy, which grossed $228m the following year and still doesn't have the distinction of being his biggest hit – that would be Grown Ups ($272m), unless you count his voice work on the animated Hotel Transylvania ($359m).</p><p>The comic's pulling power has never been in doubt. But with Punch-Drunk Love, cast opposite the Oscar-nominated British actor Emily Watson, Sandler's acting skills were put to the test in some demented moments of warped romance. In one scene, the tentative lovers are exchanging whispered sweet nothings. Him: \"Your face is so beautiful, I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it.\" Her: \"I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful eyes with an ice-cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em.\"</p><p>The writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, who later made There Will Be Blood, felt rejuvenated by Sandler. \"I tried to make this simple little movie,\" he said. \"But sometimes simplicity can be so complicated. That's why it was good for Emily and me to work with Adam. He's so natural, he just shows up ready for work, whereas Emily and I tend to crawl up our own asses!</p><p>\"It's all about learning that whatever you did the first time was probably right. You don't have to do everything 50 times and then twist a corkscrew around it just to be sure.\"</p><p>Sandler's career didn't take a turn for the avant-garde after Anderson's movie but it's nice to think it let some fresh air into his persona, and allowed him to accept that he did not always have to be the guy with whom moviegoers would most like to share a pint.</p><p>Judd Apatow's 2008 Funny People, a study of the tormented personal lives of a group of fictional comedians, provided another example of how fine Sandler could be when he wasn't dispatching valentines to the audience. His character, an emotionally remote megastar, is diagnosed with a terminal illness but continues to use his celebrity for sex and power even after he recovers unexpectedly. Apatow and Sandler were room-mates early in their careers; it's possible that Funny People, with its radioactive anxiety about success, is the most personal film either man has made.</p><p>After every extracurricular challenge in other people's films, Sandler always snaps back into place in his ordinary Joe, blue-collar civvies. But the influence of Funny People was discernible in the part he wrote for himself in Grown Ups, where he played Lenny, a powerful agent concerned about the wedge that wealth had driven between him and his old school chums.</p><p>Lenny is careful to remove his snazzy sunglasses in front of his pals, and tries to conceal the fact that the young Asian woman in his party is in fact his children's au pair. In the climax, Lenny forgoes a sporting victory to allow a more downtrodden man a taste of triumph, which feels like Sandler's way of reassuring us that his own feet remain on the ground, even if that ground happens to be in Bel Air.</p><p>His ordinariness is the defining characteristic of his celebrity. Few modern stars have acquired such wealth and fame from pledging allegiance to the schlubby American everyman: sweatpants, corn dogs and all.</p><p>\"I don't feel he's changed,\" says Dugan. \"He's always been a really good guy. The press aren't nice to him – the reviews are crazy-cruel. But he doesn't care. All he wants to do is make people laugh and connect with the audience. He produces, he writes, he picks the music, he's in the editing room. He's a real film-maker – he's an artist.\"</p><p>Potted profile</p><p><strong>Born</strong> 9 September 1966, Brooklyn, New York City.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> After working the standup circuit, he landed a small acting role on The Cosby Show. In 1990, began a four-year stint on Saturday Night Live, launchpad for comedy superstars such as Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Kristen Wiig and Eddie Murphy.</p><p><strong>High point</strong> For him, the global success of Grown Ups. For the rest of us, his engagingly murky turns in Punch-Drunk Love and Funny People.</p><p><strong>Low point</strong> For a star whose worth is measured in box-office receipts, it must have mattered that his 2012 film That's My Boy flopped.</p><p><strong>What he says </strong>\"I know what [the critics] are writing about me. But then remember that I didn't get into movies to please the critics. I got into it to make people laugh and have fun with my friends.\" (2013)</p><p><strong>What they say </strong>\"What drives him is the desire to be funny and innovative. If there's something in the film he's making and he finds out there's a similar thing in another movie that just came out, he says, 'Go watch it. If we have to cut ours, we'll cut it.' He wants it to be fresh.\" – Dennis Dugan.</p>","headline":"Adam Sandler: goofy chipmunk known for fart jokes has a serious side too","trailText":"<p>Dextrous actor has shown a willingness to play with his persona with two meaty roles at the Toronto film festival that belie his slapstick image</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/3/1409765214728/Premiere-Of-Columbia-Pict-006.jpg","wordcount":"1618","commentable":"true","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-06T17:43:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/03/adam-sandler-goofy-chipmunk-known-for-fart-jokes-serious-side","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/sep/03/adam-sandler-goofy-chipmunk-known-for-fart-jokes-serious-side","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/adamsandler","webTitle":"Adam Sandler","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/adamsandler","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/adamsandler","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/profile","webTitle":"The Guardian profile","description":"A weekly focus on the people making the headlines","type":"series","sectionId":"theguardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/profile","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/series/profile","sectionName":"From the Guardian","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/paul-thomas-anderson","webTitle":"Paul Thomas Anderson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/juddapatow","webTitle":"Judd Apatow","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juddapatow","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/juddapatow","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ryangilbey","webTitle":"Ryan Gilbey","r2ContributorId":"25456","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/4/1304527589092/ryan_gilby.jpg","firstName":"ryan","lastName":"gilbey","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ryan Gilbey is film critic of the New Statesman and writes on film for the Guardian, Sunday Times and Sight &amp;

Last week, the Secret Cinema organisation royally messed up the timing of its latest offering, a huge onsite theatricalised presentation of Robert Zemeckis's 1985 gem Back To The Future, in which Marty McFly, a feisty teen played by Michael J Fox, travels back in time to the 1950s, only to discover that his mom, now a total babe, has the hots for him.</p><p>The first week's performances had to be cancelled at short notice as the whole thing wasn't ready in time, resulting in social media fury and hundreds of disappointed punters forlornly wandering the east London streets in 50s dress.</p><p>Well, maybe Secret Cinema was having its Eric Stoltz moment: I like to think the delay was an elaborate postmodern joke about the fact that Back To The Future was originally cast with Stoltz in the lead role – an actor who was sacked after five weeks because he wasn't funny enough – and filming had to start all over again with Fox.</p><p>As a Secret Cinema virgin I found the event engaging and entertainingly bizarre: faux-American and yet very English in all its fancy-dress eccentricity. It isn't exactly an immersive, wraparound experience – you could get that better by seeing the film at an old-fashioned cinema showing. But it turned into an impressive festival of fan love, a Comic-Con-ish event in which so many audience members dressed up in 1950s clothes which were as authentic as those of the actors employed by the production, that everyone was a co-contributor: it was virtually a user-generated live event.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443538760'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/31/1406847279069/secret2-008.jpg' alt='secret2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The stores glimpsed on screen are meticulously reconstructed – the Texaco gas station, the Hill Valley Telegraph office and the cinema showing Cattle Queen Of Montana. Photograph: Al Overdrive /Secret Cinema</figcaption></figure><p>A huge patch of ground near the Olympic village in east London had been transformed into a passable approximation of the 1955 Hill Valley town square in which Fox finds himself. The town hall itself, with its fatefully stopped clock, is a huge facade at one end – it forms the screen on which the film is shown – and the stores glimpsed on screen are meticulously reconstructed – the Texaco gas station, the JD Armstrong Realty office, the Hill Valley Telegraph office and the cinema showing Cattle Queen Of Montana with Ronald Reagan –  and stocked with period-specific stuff.</p><p>It was here that we milled around for a couple of hours before the movie began, looking in at the repro shops and queuing for ages for hot dogs and shakes. Not many were availing themselves of the freedom to smoke although there were a few vapers.</p><p>Bizarrely, while the site is still in daylight, buildings bearing names such as John Lewis and Westfield loom prominently and surreally over everything. Nightfall helps the period effect.</p><p>Actors cavort around playing jocks, nerds, cops, bobbysoxers – all interacting with the audience. Lou, the proprietor of Lou's Diner, was telling people not to jaywalk; a couple of guys in workmen's overalls came out of the high school and proceeded to do Chuckles Brothers-type comedy with a ladder, to everyone's alarm. I had that feeling familiar from the Edinburgh Fringe – trying not to catch the eye of an actor who wants to make you the foil for the wacky routine he's got planned.</p><p>Before the actual screening of the film, we get someone impersonating Marty McFly demonstrating how to skateboard behind a speeding car – and then there's some live 50s rock'n'roll, inspired by the prom scene.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443538761'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/31/1406847121236/secret1-008.jpg' alt='secret1' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The 50s prom kids are of course stunned and even scared as Marty's guitar riffs morph from classic rock'n'roll to alien 80s metal.

The 50s prom kids are of course stunned and even scared as Marty's guitar riffs morph from classic rock'n'roll to alien 80s metal: Marty tells them their \"kids will love it\".</p><p>I like to think this moment secretly inspired Oliver Sacks – who later consulted with Fox over his Parkinson's – when he famously took an amnesiac rock fan named Greg to a Grateful Dead concert in 1991: Greg's condition meant he couldn't remember any of the band's newer stuff, only the songs from before he became ill. As the band progressed from their early material on through to their latest compositions, Greg became silent and thunderstruck, finally murmuring: \"This is like the music of the future.\"</p><p>I'm not sure exactly what Secret Cinema seriously offers the business of film distribution and exhibition – but in our digital downloading age, we increasingly yearn for live events, real communal happenings, and Secret Cinema caters to that.</p><p>And it was a great pleasure to have Back To The Future back on the big screen in this celebratory context: an American classic to be compared with Groundhog Day and It's A Wonderful Life.</p><p><em>Until 31 August.

Now, with the industry shrinking and studios moving to countries with bigger subsidies and incentives for film-making, Hollywood's attention is returning home.</p><p>The Los Angeles film festival celebrates the city's movie culture with a new section devoted to movies made in and about LA. The local industry reached its peak in 1996, the year Tom Cruise starred in <em>Jerry Maguire</em>, when the number of feature film location shooting days reached a total of 13,980. That number fell to 4,976 in 2009 and, with the help of a small state subsidy, rose slightly to 6,972 days last year.</p><p>Stephanie Allain, the festival's director, said she thought a renewed emphasis on Los Angeles was appropriate. \"There's still a lot of energy here. People come here to realise their dreams.\"</p><p>Yet LA barely figured in the most prominent movies of 2013 with only one of the nine nominees for the year's best picture Oscar, <em>Her</em>, set in the city.</p><p>Allain said the new section of the festival, running from June 11-19, will be called LA Muse. The schedule for the festival is still being finalised but she said it would include about 10 specially designated Los Angeles moments, including the world premiere of a small film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090994/\" title=\"\"><em>Echo Park</em></a><em>,</em> which was shot mostly in the neighbourhood of that name, where young bohemians and professionals bump up against the Latin side of the city's life.</p><p>She said her favourite LA film was <em>Chinatown</em> and that her own latest work was also set in the city. The film <em>Blackbird</em>, a story about musical stardom, written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697656/\" title=\"\">Gina Prince-Bythewood</a>, is to be released in November by Relativity Media.</p><p>\"We did budget for incentive states but at the end of the day, it's an LA story,\" Allain said of the decision to film locally. She believes that the industry is due for a revival, despite the financial incentives to shoot in other states or, more likely, other countries. \"People dream stuff up here,\" she said.</p><p>There is also a new push to give cash incentives to film-makers. Hollywood's unions have been pressing Californian officials to help promote film production by expanding state subsidies and there is soon to be a vote on a proposal. However, Kenneth Ziffren, the director of the City of Los Angeles's Entertainment Industry and Production Office, said last week that its prospects remain uncertain.</p><p>Now in her third year as director, Allain is also planning to publish an annual poster designed by a changing roster of Los Angeles artists. This year's entry, by <a href=\"http://www.edruscha.com/\" title=\"\">Edward Ruscha</a>, offers a looming logo featuring spotlights that seems to mimic the classic trademark of 20th Century Fox.</p>","headline":"Festival aims to put Hollywood back in the frame with bid to recapture the glory days","trailText":"Event's director hopes initiative will revive LA as a go-to location and result in a new clutch of classic movies, writes <strong>Lin Jenkins</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2014/3/8/1394317658248/Chinatown-006.jpg","wordcount":"494","commentable":"true","byline":"Lin Jenkins","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-15T22:34:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/la-festival-hollywood-location-revival","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/09/la-festival-hollywood-location-revival","sectionName":"US news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/los-angeles","webTitle":"Los Angeles","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/los-angeles","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/california","webTitle":"California","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/california","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lin-jenkins","webTitle":"Lin Jenkins","r2ContributorId":"54500","firstName":"lin","lastName":"jenkins","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lin-jenkins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/lin-jenkins","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/worldnews","webTitle":"World news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/worldnews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/worldnews","sectionName":"From the Observer","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","sectionName":"From the Observer","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431617305","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2014/3/8/1394317649822/Chinatown-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"true","source":"Moviestore Collection/REX","altText":"Chinatown","suppliersReference":"1557117a","height":"54","credit":"Moviestore Collection/REX","caption":"Classic movie Chinatown was set in and around Los Angeles.
