And stamp duty is one of the equations you have to jump through to secure the deal.\"</p><p></p><p>Housing expert Henry Pryor said it was a purely political move to win favour among locals, and was unlikely to see a flood of English buyers moving to Wales. \"The average house price in Wales is 10% below the average in the West Midlands, so it's already a lot cheaper to buy there – an extra 1% isn't going to make a difference and encrouage buyers to move to Wales,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Nick Barnes, head of research at estate agent Chesterton Humberts, agreed: \"It is likely to benefit first-time buyers, although I suppose it could attract the attention of investors picking up property in big cities such as Swansea and Cardiff where there is a decent-sized population. But it'll be interesting to see if the party actually carry out what they've promised.\"</p><p></p><p>Stamp duty is zero for property sold up to the £125,000 mark; between £125,000 and £250,000 it is 1%;

Rightwing political parties’ best chance of rapidly winning over voters could be via the lottery, according to new research.<br></p><p>A joint <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2014/twerp_1039_oswald.pdf\">Australian and British study</a> has found that lottery winners tend to switch their political allegiances to rightwing parties after their windfalls. They also appear to become less egalitarian and less concerned by the challenges faced by people on low incomes.</p><p>The research analysed more than 4,000 British citizens who won up to £200,000 ($365,000) on the country’s national lottery. Most of these wins were of relatively small amounts, with only 541 people winning over £500 ($910). In all, there were around 11,000 observations of winners, due to the fact that many people won money more than once.</p><p>Even among those who won small amounts of money, researchers found a clear trend of lottery winners switching support from the Labour party, traditionally a leftwing party, to the rightwing Conservatives.</p><p>Existing Conservative voters who won lottery money said their support for the party had strengthened after the lucky break, while winners from all political persuasions were more likely to say that ordinary people already had a fair share of wealth, compared with before their win.</p><p>Nearly 18% of winners immediately switched support to the Conservatives after their wins over the course of the study, which was based on household panel surveys taken each year from 1996 to 2009.</p><p>Overall, 45% of people who won more than £500 on the lottery said they supported rightwing parties, compared with 38% of non-winners throughout the course of the studies.</p><p>The lurch to the right was more pronounced for those who won large amounts of money and was more common among men than women.</p><p>Researchers – from the University of Melbourne and the University of Warwick – said that studying lottery winners “isn’t perfect” due to unknown biases such as the personality traits of people who play the lottery in the first place.</p><p>But they point out that more than 50% of the British population plays the lottery on a regular basis. Data on how lottery wins correlate with political views has yet to be gathered in Australia.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/staff/npowdthavee/default.html\">Professor Nattavudh Powdthavee</a>, a report co-author at the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia that the researchers were studying whether political ideologies are driven by deeply held ethical views or self-interest.</p><p>“The amount won in the lottery is completely randomised but we saw that the more you win, the more right-leaning you become,” he said. “You are more likely to favour rightwing ideas, such as lower taxation, and are less favourable to redistributive policies.</p><p>“The change was instant following the lottery win. We could track it from year to year and saw there was almost no lag time, particularly if there was a large win over £500.”</p><p>The study claims to be the first of its type but it cites a US study that shows a high degree of hostility among lottery winners towards certain taxes.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/\">separate American paper</a> from 2012, conducted by researchers at Berkeley University, found that the wealthier people become, the less compassionate they are. Researchers found luxury car drivers were more likely to cut off other drivers rather than wait for them at an intersection, while rich people cared less than people on lower incomes about a person who had to build a patio while suffering from cancer.</p>","headline":"Winning the lottery makes you more conservative, study finds","trailText":"A sudden windfall makes people less compassionate and 18% of winners immediately switched support to conservatives","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgx7","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391652555277/48f16240-4520-422f-8d13-fa0bed822243-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391652555277/48f16240-4520-422f-8d13-fa0bed822243-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"548","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429025569","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2ee77e4b0ab978b0f9737","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Oliver Milman","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039047","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:45:49+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/06/winning-lottery-makes-you-more-conservative","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/06/winning-lottery-makes-you-more-conservative","tags":[{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/consumer-affairs","references":[]},{"id":"society/gambling","webTitle":"Gambling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/gambling","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/oliver-milman","webTitle":"Oliver Milman","rcsId":"Oliver Mi","r2ContributorId":"47089","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/24/1369407668675/Oliver-Milman.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Oliver Milman is a reporter at Guardian Australia, focused on environmental issues.

Only three months later we decided to go our separate ways. We have a joint mortgage but were not married or legally bound in any other way. We have both vacated the property to avoid any further arguments regarding bills.</p><p>My ex put down a deposit of around £8,000 for the house and we agreed I would buy various items of furniture and household equipment while she was saving this up. During the time we were together in the house we never worried about who was paying for what as we thought of everything as one. The direct debit for the mortgage comes out of my current account.</p><p>Until recently, she paid her half of council tax, mortgage and other bills. However, a couple of weeks ago she said to me that she will no longer pay anything as she put down all the deposit, and she doesn't see why she should pay any of the mortgage or other bills any more.</p><p>The house has been on the market for eight weeks now. What would be my best course of action? Should I:</p><p>• Keep on paying the council tax, bills and the mortgage on my own and hope/try to get back what would be owed to me when we sell the house</p><p>• Stop paying the mortgage and wait for the property to be repossessed (I know it's not the best option)</p><p>• Pay only half of the mortgage?</p><p>If I carry on paying everything, what chance do I have of getting back from her what she owes me, and how would I go about it? If she wants to buy me out do I have to support any solicitor fees or other fees, or would it be solely her responsibility? If I take her to court because she is refusing to pay what I mentioned above, who would cover the court fees? <strong>SN</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> While taking your ex-girlfriend to court in order to agree your financial matters might help her to focus on how you will share out your money and possessions, going to court isn't necessarily the best answer. What is more, before a court will consider making a decision for you it will usually require evidence that you have tried mediation. If you haven't done so, going to court will be a waste of time and you really shouldn't consider it as an option without <a href=\"http://www.resolution.org.uk/findamember\" title=\"\">first getting advice from a good family solicitor</a>. You'll also each need to see a solicitor if you and your ex agree that one of you will buy the other out. You will each pay your own solicitor.</p><p>But what you and she really need to do first is work out a fair way of dividing your money and property. If you can't manage to work things out between you (the cheapest option), you should consider using a mediator trained to help you focus on the issues that need to be resolved, which typically costs about £80 a session. More information on how to come to an agreement and using mediation is available in the <a href=\"http://www.advicenow.org.uk/living-together/breaking-up/\" title=\"\">Breaking up survival guide on the Advice Now website</a>.</p><p>What you can't do is pay only half the mortgage, because your lender is in control of the amount taken by direct debit, not you. What you definitely shouldn't do is stop paying the mortgage altogether and wait for the property to be repossessed. If you did you would incur all sorts of charges associated with repossession and run the risk that the property is sold for less than it would be worth on the open market.</p><p>Finally, it makes sense for you to carry on paying the mortgage and bills on your own for the time being, but you need to keep a record of your ex-girlfriend's share that you will have paid. How you will be repaid for this is one of the things you need to agree on with your ex, whether you choose to use the services of a mediator or not. As far as splitting your possessions goes, the law says that it belongs to you if you owned it before you got together or you bought something with your own money or you inherited something.</p>","headline":"How can my ex and I resolve a property disagreement?","trailText":"<p>She paid the deposit on our house, and now we've split up she won't pay anything towards the mortgage or bills while we attempt a sale</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3meta","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391529817361/Silhouette-of-a-back-to-b-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391529817361/Silhouette-of-a-back-to-b-006.jpg","wordcount":"705","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428897798","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8638213","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Virginia Wallis","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038051","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T07:00:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/05/how-resolve-property-disagreement-split-up","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/05/how-resolve-property-disagreement-split-up","tags":[{"id":"money/series/expertsproperty","webTitle":"Ask the experts: homebuying","type":"series","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/expertsproperty","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/series/expertsproperty","references":[]},{"id":"money/mortgages","webTitle":"Mortgages","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/mortgages","references":[]},{"id":"money/household-bills","webTitle":"Household bills","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/household-bills","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/household-bills","references":[]},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/property","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"profile/virginiawallis","webTitle":"Virginia Wallis","r2ContributorId":"19171","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/virginia_wallis_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Virginia Wallis is a freelance personal finance journalist who contributes regularly to Guardian Unlimited Money as well as acting as the site's expert on homebuying.

A further 4% are planning on introducing these types of roles in the next recruitment round (2014/15), while 15% said they hope to do so at some point in the future.</p><p>But jobs for school leavers are not replacing vacancies for university graduates, the poll suggests. In general, the employers questioned disagreed that offering school leaver positions had resulted in them recruiting fewer graduates.</p><p>Isherwood said: \"At the moment, it doesn't appear that employers are replacing graduate vacancies with school leaver vacancies; rather businesses are investing in a range of different programmes to attract and recruit a diverse range of young people – from apprenticeships and higher apprenticeships to school leaver training leading to professional qualifications.</p><p>\"However, it may be something which will begin to take hold in the future and we look forward to finding out in more detail how this section of the recruitment market is changing to meet the demands of UK plc.

I was extremely fortunate to have the support of my husband during the course.\" She graduated with the Leiths diploma in food and wine, earning a distinction, and the advanced <a href=\"http://www.wsetglobal.com/\" title=\"WSET website\">Wine and Spirit Education Trust</a> wine certificate.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428862020'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391441313695/Food-stylist-Annie-Hudson-001.jpg' alt='Food stylist Annie Hudson' width='220' height='292' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Food stylist Annie Hudson</figcaption></figure><p>Hudson knew the long hours of a top kitchen would not suit her, and thought about making celebration cakes from home. But then an opportunity came along. \"I was asked to be an assistant food stylist on a recipe book. I turned up on the first day and didn't have a clue about publishing or how a photo shoot works. I had learned about styling food, but I had to work out how the different people involved fit in, but it didn't take long.\"</p><p>Which is just as well, because a change of circumstances meant Hudson was asked to style the shoot herself. \"It was a bit of a baptism of fire, but the publishers were very supportive and very encouraging. It was a bit of a do or die situation – I could either do this and really make a go of it or fail.\"</p><p>The job went well, and Hudson decided to go all out for a career as a food stylist. \"For most of the next year I did lots of assisting, because that is the way to learn. When you are assisting you help with the food prep, do all the washing up, and unpacking and packing up of food.</p><p>\"You are on standby for the stylist if they need something mid-photo, you make coffee for everyone, and act as a runner and help sweep the floor at the end of the day. You just watch everybody the whole time and soak it all up like a sponge. It's hard work, but a fantastic way to learn.\"</p><p>Her first book project gave Hudson the beginnings of a convincing portfolio, and the experience built up while assisting gave her more skills and brought her into contact with more people in the publishing industry. \"You meet a lot of people on the job, although you can't go in there with an agenda when you are assisting. I got a website set up early on so that I had something I could refer people to. But I am not a very pushy person; I tend to wait to be asked.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428862021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391444802010/A-trifle-created-by-food--001.jpg' alt='A trifle created by food stylist Annie Hudson' width='220' height='278' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A trifle created by food stylist Annie Hudson. Photograph: Myles New, from Lorraine Pascale's Home Cooking Made Easy</figcaption></figure><p>Before the end of her first year, Hudson was asked to be food stylist on another book, this time by Lorraine Pascale. \"That was another big break, and in the end I had three books under my belt in the first year at the same time as assisting and doing a bit of other work.\"</p><p>From then, the challenge has been to keep the momentum going, increasing her client base and making sure she is considered for projects. \"I found out the names of a few commissioning editors and sent them a link to my website so they have it on file. The key relationships are with the editors and photographers – they are very influential in how much work you get, and a lot depends on whether they are happy to work with you again.\"</p><p>Hudson has been working as a food stylist for four years and has never looked back. She can now add to her portfolio the food styling for books by Kirstie Allsopp, Fay Ripley and more. \"I've been very fortunate. I had a very lucky break, and of course not everyone has that. But at the same time you make your own luck, and I wouldn't have been given that opportunity if I had not equipped myself with the skills I have now.\"</p><p>Her skills as a trained chef are essential to the job – each recipe needs to be fully researched and all ingredients bought within a budget, and then made to perfection, ready to be photographed. You always choose the very best looking ingredients, and anything perishable has to be completely fresh on the day. But, she says, she never fakes the food for the sake of the picture. \"I might slightly undercook certain things, like green vegetables, so that they keep their shape or colour, but essentially everything would be edible.\"</p><p>She advises anyone considering a career in food styling to work very hard on gaining those crucial cookery skills, either by gaining experience in kitchens or catering, or by doing a cookery course. \"I have worked with assistants who say they want to do this job, and I say 'That's all very well but you've got to be able to cook'.</p><p>\"You have to have an artistic bent, but you must also be confident that you can work with most cooking methods and ingredients, and you have to know how to get yourself out of trouble if something doesn't work out.\"</p><p>With those skills under your belt, Hudson says, you can approach food stylists to offer your services as an assistant, and build up your experience from there. \"It is competitive, but if you work well as an assistant you will always be asked back. You will get recommended to other food stylists, publishers and photographers, and sometimes find that a generous stylist will put your name forward for a job if they are not available to do it themselves.\"</p>","headline":"How do I become … a food stylist","trailText":"<p>Preparing food, washing up, sweeping floors – start low but aim high and you might find yourself styling food for the big names</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mdg8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391504994814/A-trifle-created-by-food--003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391504994814/A-trifle-created-by-food--003.jpg","wordcount":"1086","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428803820","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8604001","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sandra Haurant","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2037266","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-07T09:04:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/04/how-become-food-stylist","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/04/how-become-food-stylist","tags":[{"id":"money/series/how-do-i-become-a","webTitle":"How do I become …","type":"series","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/how-do-i-become-a","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/series/how-do-i-become-a","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sandrahaurant","webTitle":"Sandra Haurant","rcsId":"GNL498469","r2ContributorId":"16401","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/07/sandra_haurant_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sandra Haurant is a freelance journalist and a former editor of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">the Guardian's money section</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sandrahaurant","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sandrahaurant","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428862017","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391439555085/Lorraine-Pascale-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Observer","photographer":"Lee Strickland","altText":"Lorraine Pascale","height":"54","credit":"Lee Strickland/Observer","caption":"Since qualifying, Annie Hudson has styled food for Lorraine Pascale (above), Kirstie Allsopp and Fay Ripley.

The scholars of personal finance seem on track for a similar level of disconnection from reality. <br></p><p>Take this new study, in the Financial Analysts Journal, that says \"retirement is not hopeless.\" Indeed, all you need to do is save 22 times the annual income you hope to have when you retire. That means if you make $150,000, and hope to retire on $100,000 a year, you only need to sock away $2.2m in a bank account to be able to retire comfortably. </p><p>The authors of the study assume you will live to be 100 years old, by the way, if not 105 years old. As you do.  <br></p><p> The Wall Street Journal breezily calls this arrangement \"<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303743604579354821019477390\">retiring on your own terms</a>.\"</p><p>You can call it retiring on your own terms, the same way you can call buying a private jet and a ranch in Telluride, Colorado living on your own terms – the terms, that is, of fantasy and not reality. </p><p>It's simply a math problem. Let's say you are in your 40s, making $150,000 a year, a generous salary in almost any city in the country. The taxman cometh, does he not? That $150,000, after taxes, becomes the slightly less dazzling sum of $100,000 a year. </p><p>It would be churlish to complain about such a salary, however: $100,000 a year is still far more than many Americans dream of, particularly in this less-than-stellar economy, and certainly at the upper end of the middle class. <br></p><p>Now you have to save that money as well as living on it. How much can you save? A standard and sensible budget, <a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/your-ultimate-budget-guideline-the-502030-rule/\">advocated by LearnVest and others, is to use a simple formula called 50/20/30</a>. This means that you spend 50% of your salary on expenses. Another 30% goes to lifestyle expenses – the things that make life liveable unless you prefer living in a hut: cable and phone plans, clothes, books, gym fees, childcare and pets, restaurants and entertainment.  <br></p><p>Then the final 20% goes to saving for retirement. <br></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2429e942-2d8d-4093-b66e-7e236ee55017\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391451832947/273a1645-6611-42da-b642-0160d8bd687a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A still from one of James Kerr's animated Renaissance GIFs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Retirement planning that's entirely too old fashioned. Photograph: James Kerr / Scorpion Dagger</figcaption> </figure> <p>This is a reasonable budget. If you save more than 20% of your salary for retirement, you're giving up enjoying your present life: you're dedicating yourself to living in holy denial of all worldly pleasures like a monk or a nun, in the hopes of a lavish, or at least an exceedingly comfortable, life when you're over 60-years-old. Twenty percent for retirement is, by the way, an aggressive goal. Most people save much less. <br></p><p>So let's say that, with your net pay of $100,000 a year, you set aside 20% for retirement. That gives you $20,000 a year, saved, every year, to make your retirement as comfortable as possible. That's $20,000 a year you're now foregoing, not putting it into school fees, into trips, into anything you might need at the moment. It's locked away with a retirement chastity belt - in a bank account, by the way, not in stocks. <br><br>And once you reach this pinnacle of saving virtue, how long would it take you to reach your goal of $2.2mn for retirement? <br></p><p>Only a mere 110 years. </p><p>Yes, if you save $20,000 a year, you can expect to collect your $2.2mn in some future utopia, perhaps from the Starship Enterprise's ATM, which you will reach using your Jetsons jetpack. At that rate, you'll have had to make arrangements with science to keep your brain in a jar, pulsing for half a century past the normal mortality rate. </p><p>Ten years and a century seems a daunting amount of time to live past the age of 40, much less to save. So let's say you save more aggressively. How does 30% sound? You give up a few family vacations; your children go to community college. <br></p><p>If you save 30% of your salary, or 30% a year, it will take you 73 years to get to $2.2mn. Saving for 73 years is ambitious if most charts tell you you're lucky to live for another 40-50 years after your prime working years. <br></p><p>There are also a lot of impossible assumptions in this aggressive plan: for instance, that even if you reach $150,000 a year in annual salary, that you'll make it nearly forever, never suffering a layoff or taking less pay. <br></p><p>That's a far-fetched expectation. High salaries, as a rule, don't last forever. Older workers,  particularly women between the ages of 45-54, are currently leaving the workforce in the greatest numbers, partly because there is no work for them. The salary of your prime earning years doesn't last very long.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b6720f57-9f70-4e20-a594-06635c1358a5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391452368678/c08da061-f976-4f6b-ace2-8ccc45878afe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"piggy bank\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>If this child earned $150,000 a year and put away one-third of his salary, he could save $2.2mn in 73 years. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <p>Maybe you think this is all a bit severe. After all, can't you put your money in the stock market, where it can earn some returns? <br></p><p>You could - and earn 4% to 6% a year, conservatively, which would help you along. </p><p>But this plan doesn't trust the stock market.  Ideally, your $2.2m would all be invested in \"riskless assets\" (no such thing, by the way; every investment carries some risk, even if low). In this case, the riskless asset that you should favor is a kind of Treasury bond that protect you against inflation. So far so good, except that no risk means no reward – which is why you should assume \"a rate of return of zero\".</p><p>That's where this gets completely out of hand.  And yet the authors of the study imply that failing to achieve these incredible savings is a matter of mere discipline: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>﻿\"Well-run … pension plans provided retirement income for generations. When plans failed, it is because they broke the rules. The same applies to individuals. By understanding a set of rules on how much to save and how to invest and then sticking to those rules – that is, by making a pension promise to oneself – retirement income goals can be met.\"</p></blockquote><p>This is absurd. <br></p><p>This is why the cult of \"saving for retirement\" needs to be held in check, lest it brainwash anyone and pile guilt on hardworking families for having some mild enjoyment of life rather than living only for the future. Saving for retirement is a smart idea, and a necessary one, but stacking up bills in a bank account and eating ramen every night won't get you there; it is both utterly joyless and totally ineffective.</p><p>So what should you think about when you retire? There are libraries full of books about it. Start here: Retirement should include some thought to regular income – dividends, rental properties, insurance contracts – and a decent investment plan.</p><p>To be sure, there are some good things to take away from plan like this. The first is that people do tend to spend too much, and particularly with the rise of credit, they spend beyond their means. Household indebtedness has been a problem for years. One well-to-do techie, known as <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-retire-early-35-years-early-2014-01-17\">Mr Money Moustache</a>, managed to sock away enough money to \"retire\" in his 30s with his family on $25,000 a year, which he considers a fortune. Even he has a lot of money in stocks and options, and says he makes sure to sell batches of them whenever he has to meet a major expense. <br></p><p>The other major issue: the retirement issue in this country is less due to personal failure than structural failures. Saving enough is not the primary problem with our retirement system. The primary problem is that wages have been dropping for decades, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/feb/02/retirement-savings-ira-myra-obama-wages\">leaving people with much less to save</a> - especially people who live on far, far less than $150,000 a year. That's largely because corporations are hoarding profits, raising CEO salaries and skimping on what they pay employees. Corporate executives have been the big beneficiaries of this trend, with a jump of 876% in pay between 1978 and 2011, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2013/10/21/131021ta_talk_surowiecki\">as the New Yorker's James Surowiecki pointed out</a>. At the same time, corporations – and the goverment – have largely <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/125011337/deferred-promises-america-s-pension-crisis\">reduced or eliminated pension plans</a> that provided a retirement backstop to millions of middle-class employees. <br></p><p>If only we could impose the same kind of discipline on corporate executives as we do on the middle class, perhaps we'd have a real answer to the retirement problem. </p>","headline":"Why the multimillion dollar retirement is not for the middle class","trailText":"A new study advocates a pension plan that's impossible for most families, unless they have a huge income and decades to spare<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mdk5","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391452193070/f490861c-8407-4318-8c71-631c072f0d40-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391452193070/f490861c-8407-4318-8c71-631c072f0d40-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428813672","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52efc38ce4b0e2b516f9ea37","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Heidi Moore","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2037371","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-06T14:00:00-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/feb/03/retirement-saving-study-fantasy-salary-millions","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/feb/03/retirement-saving-study-fantasy-salary-millions","tags":[{"id":"money/us-money-blog","webTitle":"US money blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/us-money-blog","references":[]},{"id":"money/retirement-us","webTitle":"US retirement","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/retirement-us","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/retirement-us","references":[]},{"id":"money/us-personal-finance","webTitle":"US personal finance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-personal-finance","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/us-personal-finance","references":[]},{"id":"business/investing","webTitle":"Investing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/investing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/investing","references":[]},{"id":"business/useconomy","webTitle":"US economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/useconomy","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/heidi-moore","webTitle":"Heidi Moore","r2ContributorId":"51002","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/23/1358972490699/heidimoore_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Heidi Moore is the Guardian's US finance and economics editor.

On 22 June, when I checked my confirmation, I noticed my surname was spelled Walkee, not Walker. I telephoned lastminute.com which said it would resend the confirmation with the correct name. I received no revised ticket and, at the end of August, asked where it was. I was told that no new ticket had been requested, but I was reassured it would be dealt with. </strong></p><p><strong>Twelve hours before my flight I had still received nothing and was told the person dealing with my request was on leave. I asked if I would be able to board the flight, but was told I could not because the name on the ticket did not match my passport. I also asked from which name they had taken payment from my card and was told, at this point, it was Walker. I said I was puzzled at how they could take payment from the correct name, but issue tickets in the wrong one. </strong></p><p><strong>I was also told that the only way I could get on the flight to San Francisco was to purchase another ticket at £620 (the original ticket being £480). I argued that I wanted a refund or a free ticket, but was told to pursue this with customer services. </strong></p><p><strong>It did refund me the tax on the cancelled ticket which amounted to about £130. But I also spent a considerable amount of time on hold at international call rates. </strong></p><p><strong>In San Francisco I contacted lastminute.com to pursue a refund. I then engaged in a series of emails where it in effect said it was sorry but that it was not willing to give me a refund. I was then told that the payment had been taken under Walkee.  </strong></p><p><strong>I contacted my bank (the Co-op) as I felt the transaction shouldn't have gone through under an incorrect name. It assured me Walker, not Walkee, had been used. Lastminute.com refused to believe what my bank had said and continued to state that payment was taken from the name Walkee. After a series of emails I was told there was nowhere to go, and that I must have been \"mistaken\" on a number of issues. </strong><em>VW,</em><strong> </strong><em>Bristol </em></p><p></p><p>For security reasons the names on airline tickets must be exactly as they are on your passport. Most airlines recognise that people sometimes make mistakes (and yours is a classic case of the perils of accidentally hitting the wrong letter) and most allow a free correction if done within 24 hours. After that, there is a charge. The problem here is that you claim it was lastminute's mistake and they say it was yours – and it is your word against theirs. But it does seem strange that, having offered to issue you a new ticket, it failed to do anything about it.</p><p>Lastminute.com insists you misspelt your name. It said the terms and conditions of Philippines Airlines state it cannot accommodate any name change requests unless made on the day of purchase – and you made contact two days later. However, it says customer services did contact the airline to try and get this overruled but it was refused. It said in a statement: \"Rules around name changes are generally strict and customers are advised to take special care when entering booking details and to contact customer services immediately should they notice an error on the confirmation email.\"</p><p>We also made direct contact with Philippine Airlines' UK office, which showed little interest in your case and simply referred it to the airline's head office in Manila. It has treated you harshly, in our opinion, given that you noticed the error just two days after booking and months before flying.</p><p>You are still out of pocket and we would advise you to take your case either to the Civil Aviation Authority (email <a href=\"mailto:passengercomplaints@caa.co.uk\" title=\"\">passengercomplaints@caa.co.uk</a>) or to the Association of British Travel Agents, as lastminute.com is ABTA-bonded. We can understand your irritation that payment was successfully taken from the wrong name (but the correct account), but unfortunately the security rules around payment (via Verified by Visa) centre around the individual's address, not their name.</p><p></p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

This has been woeful treatment. </strong><em>PB,</em> <em>Haxby, York </em></p><p>After we contacted Debenhams it arranged to have the acrylic rug collected by courier. You explained to us that you still want and need a good quality rug for your five-year-old grandson's redecorated playroom – which has a hard tiled floor – but had luckily hung on to the old one. Debenhams has refunded you the £208 for the cost of the wool rug and sent you a further £100 in gift vouchers (which have no expiry date) as \"a goodwill gesture in full and final settlement of your complaint\".</p><p>We think you received appalling service, which Debenhams has clearly recognised. It told us: \"An error in the drop-down menu of our website provided an incorrect delivery lead time of five working days, when it should have stated 12 weeks. Due to the item being out of stock, the order was further delayed. The product information also incorrectly described the rug as wool when it should have been acrylic.</p><p>\"We have taken PB's comments extremely seriously and they have been followed up in detail. We place great value on customer feedback as this enables us to address issues and review our procedures where necessary to improve customer service.\"</p><p>Not only has it removed the rug from&nbsp;sale, it has also changed the clarity of lead times. And it has updated order confirmation emails to state that separate delivery lead times apply on certain product areas, including furniture and rugs. It is commendable that Debenhams has recognised its shortcomings and taken steps to address them, but a shame you had to wait interminably long.</p><p></p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

He received a string of letters and feared a black mark on his credit record after being chased by Orange for payment, despite giving a month's notice to end his contract.</p><p>The heavy-handed treatment involved a bill for just £18, and when he queried this Orange said it was a mistake.</p><p>\"But since then I've received a series of letters until I got a final demand threatening legal action,\" says Stannard, who has written to Orange five times to no response. \"I've also spoken to around eight different people but it seems they're determined to squeeze extra money from customers in the hope they'll give up and pay, ruining credit records in the process.\"</p><p>Stannard's is one of a number of complaints from readers having difficulty cancelling their contracts with mobile phone operators and, in particular, Everything Everywhere (EE), Orange and T-Mobile.</p><p>Latest figures given to<em> The Observer</em> by telecoms ombudsman CISAS show that complaints about mobile phone companies are rising steeply, while Citizens Advice received a staggering 28,000 complaints about handsets and services last year.</p><p>Typical problems include customers finding their provider refuses to release them from their contract despite not receiving a signal in their area and are therefore unable to make or receive calls, let alone use the internet.</p><p>Bob Daniel, from Blisworth, Northamptonshire, says he hit \"a brick wall\" when trying to communicate with Orange, so he made an official complaint. He signed a 24-month phone contract in January 2013. \"The signal was OK then, but by the end of October I was getting no coverage in the evening.\" He complained and was promised calls back that never came. Eventually, he was told by an engineer that some of the operator's masts had been \"turned off\" in his area following the merger of Orange and T-Mobile to form EE.</p><p>\"But they refused to let me leave my contract early, offering only a 50% discount after my persistent complaints about them not keeping their side of the deal.\" He switched to another network, but continued to receive bills referring to Orange's debt collection process. \"They also refused to issue a deadlock letter which you need to go to the ombudsman,\" he says. \"Finally, I was able to submit a formal complaint, but this remains at the arbitration stage.\"</p><p>Consumers are getting increasingly fed-up with poor treatment from mobile phone operators, according to consumer group Which?  Executive director Richard Lloyd says: \"More and more people are tied to fixed term mobile contracts spanning as long as 24 months and can't always leave if there is a problem.</p><p>\"We want all mobile providers to be transparent about their contracts so consumers know their rights and that they are getting a fair deal.\"</p><p>In Stannard's case, Orange says that he requested a Porting Authorisation Code (Pac code) when he cancelled the contract so he could transfer his number to another operator. However, as the code wasn't used within 30 days, it expired (Stannard says it was never received) and he was moved on to a rolling contract which led to charges racking up. The sum owed has been waived and his credit file rectified, and Orange has apologised for any inconvenience. Despite his problems, Orange says there are no signal issues in his areas and the case remains with the ombudsman.</p><p>New smartphone contracts typically run for 24 months, which is along time if your circumstances change and you can't pay, use your phone, or find your contract is subject to a price increase and cheaper deals are available.</p><p>A crackdown by regulator Ofcom on providers raising costs midway through a fixed-term contract without an option to cancel saw<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/o2-customers-higher-prices-changed-contracts\" title=\"\"> O2 change its terms and conditions</a> hours after the new rules came into force, with a clause meaning customers forfeit the right to walk away.</p><p>Ofcom said the terms were legal if they were clearly flagged at the point of sale. However, if they are buried in the terms and conditions and you aren't given 30 days' notice of a price hike and the right to exit without penalty, you may want to make an official complaint.</p><p>The simplest way to get out of a mobile contract before the end of the agreed term is if you're still within the \"cooling-off period\" which typically lasts from 7-14 days after your contract begins.</p><p>If you want to cancel mid-term, contact your service provider and check its policy. Which? says that if you have a poor mobile signal at home you have rights under the Supply of Goods and Services Act.</p><p>If there is no mobile signal in your area and you are constantly losing service, you may be able to terminate the contract for non-performance. However, if it is just inside your house that your phone doesn't work, it's a different situation, as it could be something within that is causing the poor signal.</p><p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, adds: \"You can complain if you think the contract was mis-sold to you on the promise of good coverage.\"</p><p>In some cases your operator may allow you to downgrade your tariff to the cheapest package available for the remainder of your contract term if you are unable to leave your contract.</p><p>However, different providers have different policies; for example O2 does not allow downgrades within the first 12 months. Also, check if there are any restrictions if you're getting other free services such as a landline or broadband as these could be affected by a change in your tariff.</p><p>■<em> Are you having problems with your mobile phone provider?

According to market research group Mintel, this online banking fad is here to stay and chequebooks could soon be extinct. Which is a&nbsp;disaster. Here are six things you can only do with a cheque:</p><p></p><p><strong>Sliding a payment over a desk</strong></p><p>In the classic movie scene, the guy in the sharp suit writes a cheque, folds it, and slides it over the desk. The guy in the less sharp suit peeks at it, looks impressed, and nods. How much less slick would the first guy look typing in the amount he was willing to transfer, sliding over the laptop, and urging the other guy to decide before it logs him out?</p><p></p><p><strong>Taking a pen out of your pocket&nbsp;authoritatively </strong></p><p>Tapping a coffee-stained keyboard and trying to remember your customer number will never&nbsp;look as cool as whipping out a pen and a chequebook. It just won't.</p><p></p><p><strong>Posing with massive cardboard cheques for charity</strong></p><p>No matter how worthy the cause, a massive printout of your transaction confirmation isn't going to make the local paper.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stopping a cheque just to spite&nbsp;someone</strong></p><p>A cheque takes up to five working days to clear. That means the person you've paid has to be nice to you for nearly a week, in case you change your mind and cancel it. Try it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Being handed a blank cheque</strong></p><p>Imagine the possibilities. A blank online transaction isn't nearly as exciting; it's just zero. I'm writing you one of those right now.</p><p></p><p><strong>Postdating a cheque hundreds of&nbsp;years in the future</strong></p><p>This is especially funny as a birthday present for a bratty child.</p>","headline":"The joy of cheques: six reasons why they're better than online banking","trailText":"<strong>Erica Buist:</strong> With the increasing popularity of computerised payments, the future of the cheque seems precarious – which is a pity","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mcxh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391186163723/Cheque-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391186163723/Cheque-006.jpg","wordcount":"260","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428602054","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8629017","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Erica Buist","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2036141","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T18:00:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2014/feb/02/cheques-better-than-online-banking","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/shortcuts/2014/feb/02/cheques-better-than-online-banking","tags":[{"id":"money/cheques","webTitle":"Cheques","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/cheques","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/cheques","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/shortcuts","webTitle":"Shortcuts","type":"blog","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/shortcuts","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/consumer-affairs","references":[]},{"id":"money/banks","webTitle":"Banks and building societies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/banks","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","webTitle":"Comment & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/features","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/erica-buist","webTitle":"Erica Buist","r2ContributorId":"58928","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380716812168/Erica-Buist.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Erica is a journalist, photographer, accent expert and occasional stand-up comedian.

Rightwing political parties’ best chance of rapidly winning over voters could be via the lottery, according to new research.<br></p><p>A joint <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2014/twerp_1039_oswald.pdf\">Australian and British study</a> has found that lottery winners tend to switch their political allegiances to rightwing parties after their windfalls. They also appear to become less egalitarian and less concerned by the challenges faced by people on low incomes.</p><p>The research analysed more than 4,000 British citizens who won up to £200,000 ($365,000) on the country’s national lottery. Most of these wins were of relatively small amounts, with only 541 people winning over £500 ($910). In all, there were around 11,000 observations of winners, due to the fact that many people won money more than once.</p><p>Even among those who won small amounts of money, researchers found a clear trend of lottery winners switching support from the Labour party, traditionally a leftwing party, to the rightwing Conservatives.</p><p>Existing Conservative voters who won lottery money said their support for the party had strengthened after the lucky break, while winners from all political persuasions were more likely to say that ordinary people already had a fair share of wealth, compared with before their win.</p><p>Nearly 18% of winners immediately switched support to the Conservatives after their wins over the course of the study, which was based on household panel surveys taken each year from 1996 to 2009.</p><p>Overall, 45% of people who won more than £500 on the lottery said they supported rightwing parties, compared with 38% of non-winners throughout the course of the studies.</p><p>The lurch to the right was more pronounced for those who won large amounts of money and was more common among men than women.</p><p>Researchers – from the University of Melbourne and the University of Warwick – said that studying lottery winners “isn’t perfect” due to unknown biases such as the personality traits of people who play the lottery in the first place.</p><p>But they point out that more than 50% of the British population plays the lottery on a regular basis. Data on how lottery wins correlate with political views has yet to be gathered in Australia.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/staff/npowdthavee/default.html\">Professor Nattavudh Powdthavee</a>, a report co-author at the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia that the researchers were studying whether political ideologies are driven by deeply held ethical views or self-interest.</p><p>“The amount won in the lottery is completely randomised but we saw that the more you win, the more right-leaning you become,” he said. “You are more likely to favour rightwing ideas, such as lower taxation, and are less favourable to redistributive policies.</p><p>“The change was instant following the lottery win. We could track it from year to year and saw there was almost no lag time, particularly if there was a large win over £500.”</p><p>The study claims to be the first of its type but it cites a US study that shows a high degree of hostility among lottery winners towards certain taxes.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/\">separate American paper</a> from 2012, conducted by researchers at Berkeley University, found that the wealthier people become, the less compassionate they are. Researchers found luxury car drivers were more likely to cut off other drivers rather than wait for them at an intersection, while rich people cared less than people on lower incomes about a person who had to build a patio while suffering from cancer.</p>","headline":"Winning the lottery makes you more conservative, study finds","trailText":"A sudden windfall makes people less compassionate and 18% of winners immediately switched support to conservatives","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgx7","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391652555277/48f16240-4520-422f-8d13-fa0bed822243-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391652555277/48f16240-4520-422f-8d13-fa0bed822243-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"548","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429025569","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2ee77e4b0ab978b0f9737","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Oliver Milman","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039047","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T13:45:49+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/06/winning-lottery-makes-you-more-conservative","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/06/winning-lottery-makes-you-more-conservative","tags":[{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/consumer-affairs","references":[]},{"id":"society/gambling","webTitle":"Gambling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/gambling","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/oliver-milman","webTitle":"Oliver Milman","rcsId":"Oliver Mi","r2ContributorId":"47089","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/24/1369407668675/Oliver-Milman.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Oliver Milman is a reporter at Guardian Australia, focused on environmental issues.

This has had a \"chilling effect on policy\" and delayed crucial reforms including easier switching between operators.</p><p>Miller is considering a shake-up of the Ofcom appeals process, making it harder for companies to object on technicalities. Ofcom, which is partly publicly funded, has faced 61 appeals over the last five years, with nearly all of its rulings challenged in the Competition Appeals Tribunal. The regulator says fighting these cases has cost between £2m and £4.5m a year.</p><p>\"There are significant concerns that under the current regime, Ofcom's decisions can be derailed too easily, through technical challenges that ignore the substance of the regulator's judgments,\" the letter states. \"The routine use of legal challenges has had a chilling effect on policy. It diverts time and money into legal disputes and away from good regulation. This is bad news for competition, for the industry, and for consumers.\"</p><p>For example, seven years after Ofcom first proposed a consumer-friendly switching system, UK consumers do not benefit from the same freedom to change service providers as other Europeans.</p><p>A decision on whether to proceed with reforming the appeals process is expected shortly from Miller. Lobbying has already succeeded in narrowing the scope of reform. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/06/regulators-lawyers-ofcom\" title=\"\">the changes were announced</a> in the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn statement, they were intended to cover all regulators, including Ofgem for electricity and gas, Ofwat for water and sewerage, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Office of Rail Regulation.</p><p>It is understood the changes will now be restricted to Ofcom, which covers media, telecoms and postal services.</p><p>The larger operators, Vodafone, BT, Sky and EE, argue that changing the regime may cause problems in cases where regulators have made mistakes.</p><p>But Ofcom has been particularly vocal about the need for change. Its chief executive, Ed Richards, said earlier this year that the UK system was \"too legalistic and too open to gaming\" by companies able to pay for large legal teams, and that \"everything we do now is subject to the huge shadow of threat of litigation\".</p><p>Ofcom's battle to loosen Sky's grip on film and sports broadcasting, which had seen the issue pass to the Competition Appeal Tribunal and eventually the Competition Commission, took five years and ended in a defeat for the regulator.</p><p>The latest round of cuts to the cost of calling a mobile was blocked for 14 months by legal challenges from network operators before being approved on appeal earlier this year.</p><p>And a move to allow consumers to transfer their mobile number from one network to another in a matter of hours rather than days has been held up since 2007, following a 2008 legal challenge by Vodafone.</p>","headline":"'Ofcom's decisons too easily derailed by companies it

Only three months later we decided to go our separate ways. We have a joint mortgage but were not married or legally bound in any other way. We have both vacated the property to avoid any further arguments regarding bills.</p><p>My ex put down a deposit of around £8,000 for the house and we agreed I would buy various items of furniture and household equipment while she was saving this up. During the time we were together in the house we never worried about who was paying for what as we thought of everything as one. The direct debit for the mortgage comes out of my current account.</p><p>Until recently, she paid her half of council tax, mortgage and other bills. However, a couple of weeks ago she said to me that she will no longer pay anything as she put down all the deposit, and she doesn't see why she should pay any of the mortgage or other bills any more.</p><p>The house has been on the market for eight weeks now. What would be my best course of action? Should I:</p><p>• Keep on paying the council tax, bills and the mortgage on my own and hope/try to get back what would be owed to me when we sell the house</p><p>• Stop paying the mortgage and wait for the property to be repossessed (I know it's not the best option)</p><p>• Pay only half of the mortgage?</p><p>If I carry on paying everything, what chance do I have of getting back from her what she owes me, and how would I go about it? If she wants to buy me out do I have to support any solicitor fees or other fees, or would it be solely her responsibility? If I take her to court because she is refusing to pay what I mentioned above, who would cover the court fees? <strong>SN</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> While taking your ex-girlfriend to court in order to agree your financial matters might help her to focus on how you will share out your money and possessions, going to court isn't necessarily the best answer. What is more, before a court will consider making a decision for you it will usually require evidence that you have tried mediation. If you haven't done so, going to court will be a waste of time and you really shouldn't consider it as an option without <a href=\"http://www.resolution.org.uk/findamember\" title=\"\">first getting advice from a good family solicitor</a>. You'll also each need to see a solicitor if you and your ex agree that one of you will buy the other out. You will each pay your own solicitor.</p><p>But what you and she really need to do first is work out a fair way of dividing your money and property. If you can't manage to work things out between you (the cheapest option), you should consider using a mediator trained to help you focus on the issues that need to be resolved, which typically costs about £80 a session. More information on how to come to an agreement and using mediation is available in the <a href=\"http://www.advicenow.org.uk/living-together/breaking-up/\" title=\"\">Breaking up survival guide on the Advice Now website</a>.</p><p>What you can't do is pay only half the mortgage, because your lender is in control of the amount taken by direct debit, not you. What you definitely shouldn't do is stop paying the mortgage altogether and wait for the property to be repossessed. If you did you would incur all sorts of charges associated with repossession and run the risk that the property is sold for less than it would be worth on the open market.</p><p>Finally, it makes sense for you to carry on paying the mortgage and bills on your own for the time being, but you need to keep a record of your ex-girlfriend's share that you will have paid. How you will be repaid for this is one of the things you need to agree on with your ex, whether you choose to use the services of a mediator or not.

A further 4% are planning on introducing these types of roles in the next recruitment round (2014/15), while 15% said they hope to do so at some point in the future.</p><p>But jobs for school leavers are not replacing vacancies for university graduates, the poll suggests. In general, the employers questioned disagreed that offering school leaver positions had resulted in them recruiting fewer graduates.</p><p>Isherwood said: \"At the moment, it doesn't appear that employers are replacing graduate vacancies with school leaver vacancies; rather businesses are investing in a range of different programmes to attract and recruit a diverse range of young people – from apprenticeships and higher apprenticeships to school leaver training leading to professional qualifications.</p><p>\"However, it may be something which will begin to take hold in the future and we look forward to finding out in more detail how this section of the recruitment market is changing to meet the demands of UK plc. It is reassuring that many employers continue to invest heavily in emerging talent.\"</p><p>Universities minister David Willetts said: \"The substantial rise in the number of graduate vacancies demonstrates that confidence in the UK economy is growing and businesses really value the skills the UK's first-rate graduates can bring to their companies.</p><p>\"A degree is still one of the best routes to a good job and a rewarding career. The increased number of graduates has been met by increased demand from employers, which is why we have made the historic commitment to remove the cap on the number of people who could go to university by 2015-16.\"</p><p>A separate survey of schoolchildren by the Association of Colleges reveals that the majority feel good about career prospects, although they are likely to feel more pessimistic as they get older.</p><p>The poll, which questioned around 2,000 11- to 16-year-olds, found that about two-thirds (65%) were \"positive about their future job options\".</p>","headline":"Graduate vacancies set to rise by 10%","trailText":"<p>Association of Graduate Recruiters says double-digit rise is good news, but that candidates must be aware of what potential employers are looking for</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3me7c","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391509744800/Graduates-celebrate-throw-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391509744800/Graduates-celebrate-throw-006.jpg","wordcount":"563","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428866736","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8642623","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Press Association","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-04T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2037756","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-07T10:41:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/04/graduate-vacancies-rise-10-per-cent","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/04/graduate-vacancies-rise-10-per-cent","tags":[{"id":"money/graduates","webTitle":"Graduate careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/graduates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/graduates","references":[]},{"id":"money/job-hunting","webTitle":"Job hunting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/job-hunting","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/job-hunting","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/education/higher-education","references":[]},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/education/education","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428872213","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391509734509/Graduates-celebrate-throw-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Christopher Thomond","altText":"Graduates celebrate throwing hats into the air","height":"54","credit":"Christopher Thomond","caption":"Reason to cheer: graduate opportunities are expected to grow in both the public and private sectors.

This doesn't make sense","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-04T15:51:41Z","body":"<p>The focus of conventional employment policy is on creating \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/more-britons-work-vital-labour\" title=\"\">more work</a>\". People without work and in receipt of benefits are viewed as a drain on the state and in need of assistance or direct coercion to get them into work. There is the belief that work is the best form of welfare and that those who are able to work ought to work. This particular focus on work has come at the expense of another, far more radical policy goal, that of creating \"less work\". Yet, as I will argue below, the pursuit of less work could provide a route to a better standard of life, including a better quality of work life.</p><p>The idea that society might work less in order to enjoy life more goes against standard thinking that celebrates the virtue and discipline of hard work. Dedication to work, so the argument goes, is the best route to prosperity. There is also the idea that work offers the opportunity for self-realisation, adding to the material benefits from work. \"<a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/\" title=\"\">Do what you love</a>\" in work, we are told, and success will follow.</p><p>But ideologies such as the above are based on a myth that work can always set us free and provide us with the basis for a good life. As I have written <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/36928\" title=\"\">elsewhere</a>, this mythologising about work fails to confront – indeed it actively conceals – the acute hardships of much work performed in modern society. For many, work is about doing what you hate.</p><p>Here I want to address another issue that is overlooked in conventional policy debates. This is the need to diminish work. Working less presents several advantages. One is the opportunity to overcome the anomaly of overwork for some and unemployment for others. Sharing out work more evenly across the available population by reducing average working time would enable those who work too much to work less and those do not work at all to partake in some work. Another advantage is the opportunity to enhance the quality of work by reducing drudgery and extending opportunities for creative activity in work. Reducing work time, in this sense, can be as much about realising the intrinsic rewards of work as reducing its burdensome qualities.</p><p>Economists may cry foul that a reduction in working time will add to firm costs and lead to job losses (mainstream economics accuses advocates of shorter work hours of succumbing to the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy\" title=\"\">lump of labour fallacy</a>\" and of failing to see the extra costs of hiring additional workers on shorter hours contracts). One retort to this is that longer work hours are not that productive. Shorter work hours may actually be more productive if they increase the morale and motivation of workers. In practice, we could achieve the same standard of living with fewer hours of work.</p><p>But the more profound question is whether we should be asking society to tolerate long work hours for some and zero work hours for others. Surely society can achieve a more equitable allocation of work that offers everyone enough time to work and enough time to do what they want? A reduction in work time, it can be argued here, would offer a route to such an allocation.</p><p>There is also the deeper issue of whether we should be measuring the value of our lives by what we produce. <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115927/productivity-taking-over-our-lives\" title=\"\">The cult of productivity crowds</a> out other more \"leisurely\" ways of living that can add to human wellbeing. Challenging this cult and seeking ways to lighten the burden of work could allow us all to live better lives inside and outside of work.</p><p>Arguments for shorter work time have a long history. Keynes, for example, gave support to a reduction in working time as a way of achieving full employment. <a href=\"http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/walker220710.html\" title=\"\">In a letter to the poet TS Eliot in 1945</a>, Keynes suggested that less work represented the \"ultimate solution\" to unemployment. Keynes also saw merit in using productivity gains to reduce work time and famously looked forward to a time (around 2030) when people would be required to <a href=\"http://www.excellentfuture.ca/sites/default/files/Economic%20Possibilities%20of%20Our%20Grandchildren.pdf\" title=\"\">work 15 hours a week</a>. Working less was a part of Keynes's vision of a \"<a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/37507\" title=\"\">good society</a>\".</p><p>Marx, from a radically different perspective, saw a reduction in working time as an essential ingredient of a future communist society. Work was part of the \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch48.htm\" title=\"\">realm of necessity</a>\" and via the use of technology it could be curtailed as a way to expand the \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch48.htm\" title=\"\">realm of freedom</a>\" in which people could realise their creative capacities in activities of their own choosing. Marx importantly thought that under communism work in the \"realm of necessity\" could be fulfilling as it would elicit and harness the creativity of workers. Whatever irksome work remained in the realm of necessity under communism again could be lessened by the harnessing of technology.</p><p>Yet another advocate of shorter work time was <a href=\"http://abolishwork.com/2014/01/15/some-anti-work-comments-from-john-stuart-mill/\" title=\"\">JS Mill</a>. He dismissed the \"gospel of work\" proposed by Thomas Carlyle in part because it drew a veil over the real costs of work, including slave work that Carlyle sought to defend. Instead, Mill advocated a \"gospel of leisure\", arguing that technology should be used to curtail work time as far as possible. This stress on technology as a means to shorten work time was later to feature in <a href=\"http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/praiseidleness.htm\" title=\"\">Bertrand Russell's 1932 essay, \"In Praise of Idleness\"</a>.</p><p>The essential ideas of the above writers resonate still today. They cut through romantic views of work and show how human progress depends on society performing less, not more, work. Although developed in radically different ways, their ideas point to a future where the burden of work is lighter and more time is available for free creative activity. At least in the case of Marx, there is still the prospect of turning work into a fulfilling activity, but the latter objective is seen as achievable only within the context of a situation in which work time is reduced. Less work is seen as a necessary foundation for better work.</p><p>Ultimately, the reduction in working time is about creating more opportunities for people to realise their potential in all manner of activities including within the work sphere. Working less, in short, is about allowing us to live more. Let's work to achieve it.</p><p></p><p><em>• This article originally appeared on </em><a href=\"http://www.pieria.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Pieria</em></a></p>","headline":"Why work more?

I was extremely fortunate to have the support of my husband during the course.\" She graduated with the Leiths diploma in food and wine, earning a distinction, and the advanced <a href=\"http://www.wsetglobal.com/\" title=\"WSET website\">Wine and Spirit Education Trust</a> wine certificate.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428862020'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391441313695/Food-stylist-Annie-Hudson-001.jpg' alt='Food stylist Annie Hudson' width='220' height='292' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Food stylist Annie Hudson</figcaption></figure><p>Hudson knew the long hours of a top kitchen would not suit her, and thought about making celebration cakes from home. But then an opportunity came along. \"I was asked to be an assistant food stylist on a recipe book. I turned up on the first day and didn't have a clue about publishing or how a photo shoot works. I had learned about styling food, but I had to work out how the different people involved fit in, but it didn't take long.\"</p><p>Which is just as well, because a change of circumstances meant Hudson was asked to style the shoot herself. \"It was a bit of a baptism of fire, but the publishers were very supportive and very encouraging. It was a bit of a do or die situation – I could either do this and really make a go of it or fail.\"</p><p>The job went well, and Hudson decided to go all out for a career as a food stylist. \"For most of the next year I did lots of assisting, because that is the way to learn. When you are assisting you help with the food prep, do all the washing up, and unpacking and packing up of food.</p><p>\"You are on standby for the stylist if they need something mid-photo, you make coffee for everyone, and act as a runner and help sweep the floor at the end of the day. You just watch everybody the whole time and soak it all up like a sponge. It's hard work, but a fantastic way to learn.\"</p><p>Her first book project gave Hudson the beginnings of a convincing portfolio, and the experience built up while assisting gave her more skills and brought her into contact with more people in the publishing industry. \"You meet a lot of people on the job, although you can't go in there with an agenda when you are assisting. I got a website set up early on so that I had something I could refer people to. But I am not a very pushy person; I tend to wait to be asked.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428862021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391444802010/A-trifle-created-by-food--001.jpg' alt='A trifle created by food stylist Annie Hudson' width='220' height='278' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A trifle created by food stylist Annie Hudson. Photograph: Myles New, from Lorraine Pascale's Home Cooking Made Easy</figcaption></figure><p>Before the end of her first year, Hudson was asked to be food stylist on another book, this time by Lorraine Pascale. \"That was another big break, and in the end I had three books under my belt in the first year at the same time as assisting and doing a bit of other work.\"</p><p>From then, the challenge has been to keep the momentum going, increasing her client base and making sure she is considered for projects. \"I found out the names of a few commissioning editors and sent them a link to my website so they have it on file. The key relationships are with the editors and photographers – they are very influential in how much work you get, and a lot depends on whether they are happy to work with you again.\"</p><p>Hudson has been working as a food stylist for four years and has never looked back. She can now add to her portfolio the food styling for books by Kirstie Allsopp, Fay Ripley and more. \"I've been very fortunate. I had a very lucky break, and of course not everyone has that. But at the same time you make your own luck, and I wouldn't have been given that opportunity if I had not equipped myself with the skills I have now.\"</p><p>Her skills as a trained chef are essential to the job – each recipe needs to be fully researched and all ingredients bought within a budget, and then made to perfection, ready to be photographed. You always choose the very best looking ingredients, and anything perishable has to be completely fresh on the day. But, she says, she never fakes the food for the sake of the picture. \"I might slightly undercook certain things, like green vegetables, so that they keep their shape or colour, but essentially everything would be edible.\"</p><p>She advises anyone considering a career in food styling to work very hard on gaining those crucial cookery skills, either by gaining experience in kitchens or catering, or by doing a cookery course. \"I have worked with assistants who say they want to do this job, and I say 'That's all very well but you've got to be able to cook'.</p><p>\"You have to have an artistic bent, but you must also be confident that you can work with most cooking methods and ingredients, and you have to know how to get yourself out of trouble if something doesn't work out.\"</p><p>With those skills under your belt, Hudson says, you can approach food stylists to offer your services as an assistant, and build up your experience from there. \"It is competitive, but if you work well as an assistant you will always be asked back. You will get recommended to other food stylists, publishers and photographers, and sometimes find that a generous stylist will put your name forward for a job if they are not available to do it themselves.\"</p>","headline":"How do I become … a food stylist","trailText":"<p>Preparing food, washing up, sweeping floors – start low but aim high and you might find yourself styling food for the big names</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mdg8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391504994814/A-trifle-created-by-food--003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391504994814/A-trifle-created-by-food--003.jpg","wordcount":"1086","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"428803820","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8604001","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sandra Haurant","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2037266","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-07T09:04:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/04/how-become-food-stylist","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/04/how-become-food-stylist","tags":[{"id":"money/series/how-do-i-become-a","webTitle":"How do I become …","type":"series","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/how-do-i-become-a","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/series/how-do-i-become-a","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sandrahaurant","webTitle":"Sandra Haurant","rcsId":"GNL498469","r2ContributorId":"16401","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/07/sandra_haurant_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sandra Haurant is a freelance journalist and a former editor of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">the Guardian's money section</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sandrahaurant","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sandrahaurant","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428862017","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/3/1391439555085/Lorraine-Pascale-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Observer","photographer":"Lee Strickland","altText":"Lorraine Pascale","height":"54","credit":"Lee Strickland/Observer","caption":"Since qualifying, Annie Hudson has styled food for Lorraine Pascale (above), Kirstie Allsopp and Fay Ripley.

It refused to make the change until the electricity ran out, which left us without power for 14 hours and then the meter was replaced by another prepay meter. </strong></p><p><strong>When, finally, a credit meter was installed we began to receive excessively high bills. It transpired that Npower had placed us on its highest tariff and it later admitted a mistake. It promised to recalculate our accounts and issue us with a new bill. This was never done. </strong></p><p><strong>We therefore cancelled our direct debit as we had lost confidence in Npower's accounting procedures. We accept that we owe money, but we are unable to accept or trust its assessment of our outstanding debt, when it seems clear that at least on one occasion they have included, as debt, monies already paid by us.  </strong><em>AA, Southampton</em></p><p></p><p>Npower claims that you originally requested that a faulty prepayment metre was replaced and that it only became aware you wanted to be moved to credit metering when the technician arrived at your house. Then it says that since your new account was being processed, it couldn't install the credit meter for another four weeks.</p><p>Bizarrely, it says that after it was installed you were kept on the standard tariff that is the only available option for prepayment customers because you hadn't specifically asked to be on the best tariff. Regardless of whether you did, or not, it's depressing, but unsurprising, that companies don't automatically notify customers they are paying too much.</p><p>After the intervention of the press office Npower has refunded the £339 difference between the standard tariff you were paying and the best one,  plus £50 compensation, but you are still wary of their calculations.</p><p>It's the energy ombudsman who will have to decide who is right.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at  </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?</p><p></p><p><strong>I have a colleague who constantly distracts me. It is not that he talks to me specifically or particularly loudly, but he constantly sings, puts on babyish voices and mutters under his breath. One really annoying habit is repeating what other people say in a stupid voice: one person may say \"That was a difficult phone call\" and he will mimic them and say \"Difficult oooh yeah!\". Or a colleague on the phone might say \"Goodbye\" and he will put on a stupid voice and say \"Goodbye\" as well. It is constant. When he sings, it is usually the chorus of the same song over and over again for weeks.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I have taken him to one side and tactfully said, \"I'm not sure if you realise, but you tend to sing and talk under your breath quite often. A few people have said they find it distracting\". His behaviour stopped for an afternoon but started again the next day. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I have asked my manager to move desks and this may happen in a few months, but I will have to deal with this man in the meantime. Also, if I move someone else will have to put up with him, which seems unfair. A lot of other people have complained about him but my manager just shrugs and says \"There is not much I can do about it\".</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>When it gets particularly loud I have mentioned that I really need to focus, but I get a stupid comment in a stupid voice such as \"You are a woman, you should be able to multi-task\". This man is in his 40s.</strong></p><p></p><p>Do you need advice on a work issue?

We bought it in November 2010 for £230,000 with a mortgage of £185,000 and a deposit of £35,000. There is a deed of trust for the money put in – £25,000 goes back to me or my mother as she gave me that much to put down as a deposit. As both my partner and I each put £5,000 in cash towards the deposit, the rest is split 50/50.</p><p></p><p>The flat, which is in Brixton, has gone up in value with estate agents estimating an asking price of anywhere up to £350,000 (although realistically the actual purchase price would be more like £320,000 to £330,000). What kind of offer would it be fair for me to make to buy my ex-partner out?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To take on the mortgage I would have to reduce it as well, as I can only borrow up to £165,000 based on my self-employed status and variable income (I wasn't self-employed when we bought the property). Any help and advice of what would be fair, and regarding stamp duty implications, would be very helpful. <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> To be able to buy out your ex-partner, you need to take on his share of the mortgage and pay him cash for his half of the value of the flat that you agree on, less the size of the mortgage at the time you took it on and less the £25,000 your mother gave you towards the deposit.</p><p></p><p>Assuming you have a 25-year repayment mortgage and have been paying interest at 5% for the past three years, that would mean taking on an outstanding mortgage of approximately £173,000 (as about £12,000 of the original £185,000 would have been paid off over three years). I'm afraid the only way of reducing the mortgage to £165,000 is to overpay it. Your lender won't just reduce the loan to suit your change in circumstances.</p><p></p><p>If you were to buy out your ex using an asking price of £330,000 for the flat, as well as taking on his share of the mortgage you would also need to find cash to pay him for his share of the flat's increase in value since you bought it. That would be calculated as half of: £330,000 minus the £25,000 your mother contributed minus the outstanding mortgage debt (assumed to be £173,000), which comes to £66,000 that you need to find. So, sadly, to be able to buy out your ex you need him to agree to use the value of the flat when you bought it and simply pay him £5,000 to return the cash he paid as a deposit. Whether that would be fair is up to your ex-partner to decide.</p><p></p><p>As far as stamp duty land tax (SDLT) goes, it would be payable on the amount of mortgage you took on plus whatever you pay him in cash. But you would only have to pay SDLT if that total was in excess of £125,000.</p>","headline":"How do we split a flat that has risen in value?","trailText":"<strong>Property advice</strong> My ex and I put in different deposits and I want to take on his portion of the mortgage","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yjpd","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/7/1389097951515/Some-pound-coins-with-a-M-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/7/1389097951515/Some-pound-coins-with-a-M-006.jpg","wordcount":"508","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426475637","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8520134","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Virginia Wallis","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2022205","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T07:00:03Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/08/how-split-flat-risen-value-different-deposits","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/08/how-split-flat-risen-value-different-deposits","tags":[{"id":"money/series/expertsproperty","webTitle":"Ask the experts: homebuying","type":"series","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/expertsproperty","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/series/expertsproperty","references":[]},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/property","references":[]},{"id":"money/houseprices","webTitle":"House prices","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/houseprices","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"profile/virginiawallis","webTitle":"Virginia Wallis","r2ContributorId":"19171","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/virginia_wallis_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Virginia Wallis is a freelance personal finance journalist who contributes regularly to Guardian Unlimited Money as well as acting as the site's expert on homebuying.
