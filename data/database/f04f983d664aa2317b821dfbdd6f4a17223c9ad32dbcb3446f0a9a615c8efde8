The interview had lasted just over 20 minutes.</p><p>The Ukip leader was accused of \"reverse-ferretting\" by the interviewer, James O'Brien, over a promise to have his expenses independently audited – an offer Ukip made on the BBC's Today programme and subsequently withdrew in a Guardian interview, saying he would not be subject to a stricter audit than other MEPs.</p><p>When it was pointed out that other MEPs – including those from the Labour party – had their expenses audited O'Flynn intervened, surprising even Farage.</p><p>Asked about other MEPs' auditing arrangement, Farage said: \"What they have is an auditor to make sure they spend the money in accordance with the rules. There are no expenses. There are fixed-rate allowances that I have spent in accordance with the rules.\"</p><p>Pressed to say if he would agree to the same audit, he said: \"We will make a decision en masse. I am very suspicious of the word audit used in that context.\" He made no commitment to an audit of his previous allowances.</p><p>Farage was also asked why he said he felt discomfort when travelling on a train and not hearing the English language. He insisted he had not said he objected, but that he did not feel comfortable.</p><p>O'Brien asked if he objected to the fact that his wife and his children could speak German, and replied that they could also speak English, adding he \"had a distinct feeling English was not the language of choice\" of those people that he heard on a train. He added he did not think his wife spoke German on a train.</p><p>Farage was also challenged about his claim that there were schools in east London where a majority of pupils did not speak English,\" with the interviewer asserting such surveys only showed whether English was the child's first language.</p><p>O'Brien pointed out his own bilingual children would be qualified as non-English speakers on this definition. Farage agreed the definition might need reworking.</p><p>O'Brien then asked about Farage's claim that people would feel uncomfortable if a group of Romanian men moved in next door, pressing him to say whether he \"would feel the same about a group of German children\".</p><p>Farage replied: \"I think you know the difference. We want an immigration policy that is not just based on controlling not just quantity but quality\".</p><p>He added: \"I am making one very simple point in this election. We cannot have any form of managed migration into Britain and remain a member of the European Union because we have an open door to nearly half a billion people.</p><p>\"We would be far better off if the policy that did not discriminate against doctors from New Zealand or engineers from India in favour of anybody regardless of background and skills coming from southern and eastern Europe and that is the great debate.\"</p><p>Explaining his claim that Romanians were more likely to be criminals, he said: \"We have a problem; unfortunately, those communist countries which I visited and I've seen the real poverty that people live in.</p><p>\"We talk about exclusion in society … go and see, since the fall in communism, what has happened to the Roma communities in those countries; they don't get jobs, they've got nowhere to live and they have been forced, in many cases, to a life of crime.</p><p>\"And what has happened to that open door? It has been an open invitation to the traffickers and the Metropolitan police have produced their statistics and they're eye-watering and I'm saying let's get a grip on it.\"</p><p>Farage accepted there were \"idiots\" in his party after news of more Islamophobic comments made by Ukip candidates.</p><p>\"Firstly, people saying silly things; yes of course we've had more of it than we'd have liked, but what is going on in the other parties? Nobody ever does ask them? I'm perfectly happy to have a debate about our idiots and people who are offensive.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/16/nigel-farage-lbc-interview-key-moments\"

Ukip leader's Euroscepticism makes him a shoo-in at the Russian state broadcaster that is often called Putin's mouthpiece","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:41:28Z","body":"<p>Nigel Farage's near monthly appearances on state-owned Russia Today have come under scrutiny after his expression of admiration for Vladimir Putin this week.</p><p>In one of his 17 appearances on the channel seen by the Guardian and transmitted since December 2010, he claims Europe  is governed not by elected democracies but instead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z7RVT0a8zI\" title=\"\">\"by the worst people we have seen in Europe since 1945\"</a>.</p><p>The Ukip leader has appeared so frequently that he is cited in literature for the TV station Russia Today as one of their special and \"endlessly quotable\" British guests. \"He has been known far longer to the RT audience than most of the British electorate,\" Russia Today claims.</p><p>The Ukip leader did not issue a word of criticism of Russian democracy in any of the Russia Today interviews viewed by the Guardian. Last August he told the channel that British intervention in Libya and Syria would go ahead regardless of any vote in the UN, and said he was still not sure President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons.</p><p>Farage's relationship with Russia has been under the spotlight since his comments last week on Ukraine. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/26/nigel-farage-vs-nick-clegg-the-debate-for-europe-live\" title=\"\">In a TV debate with Nick Clegg </a> (pictured above) he said Russia had been provoked and that the EU had blood on its hands for trying to force Ukraine to choose between itself and Russia. The Lib Dem leader is expected to challenge Farage further on the subject in a second debate, this time for the BBC, on Wednesday.</p><p>Chris Bryant, the former Labour Europe minister, said: \"One of the most stupid adages for politicians to believe is my enemy's enemy is my friend. Putin closes down the free press, jails journalists with impunity and has enriched himself beyond the dreams of Imelda Marcos and has territorial ambitions. Farage is rapidly becoming the Berlusconi of Britain.\"</p><p>Russia Today was set up in 2005 by the Russian government as a 24-hour news programme and has been accused of being a propaganda tool of Putin. Earlier this year one anchor, Liz Wahl, quit on air, saying the channel always wanted extremist voices hostile to the west.</p><p>In many of his lengthy interviews Farage predicted the breakup of Europe, adding that EU leaders \"are not undemocratic.   They are anti-democratic. These are very bad and dangerous people They are the worst people we have seen in Europe since 1945\". In another interview he claimed \"they are the most dangerous people in Europe for 70 years\".</p><p>His interviews, and warnings of the EU's imminent collapse, are often conducted against a backdrop of footage of police suppressing anti-austerity riots.</p><p>He also suggests that the EU is likely to attack other countries in the Middle East, such as Bahrain and Yemen, following the intervention in Libya. He said: \"International law itself is not going to stop the British and the French and, perhaps, the Americans, if they choose to do something.\"</p><p>He also agreed with his interviewer that the attack was largely due to a need to capture oil supplies, and agreed that the western attack will lead to collateral damage.</p><p>Asked why so few British politicians opposed the attack in Libya he says: \"What we've got in the House of Commons is a political class – they all go to the same schools, get the same jobs in research, spend their lives in politics and have never had a job in the real world. So when it comes to it, they all vote like sheep. We do not have enough independent thinkers sitting in the House of Commons preparing to think of counterarguments\".</p><p>Before the Syrian vote he told Russian TV: \"Probably, there are stronger hatreds between some of the opposition groups than there are against the Assad regime.\" He said it was probable Assad had used chemical weapons but added: \"We ought to be slightly cautious and we ought to absolutely make sure that it was Assad who used those weapons.\"</p><p>Either way he opposed the use of force saying: \"I have to say that ever since Tony Blair's time, starting off with Bosnia, we seem to go in for foreign wars with alarming regularity, often having no really clear objectives or any idea how we are going to withdraw. Just to prove that point – we've now been in Afghanistan for longer than the first and the second world wars added up together.\"</p><p>In March last year <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdZuwf5Cebk\" title=\"\">he advised viewers to disinvest from banks and property in the EU after the Cypriot bailout</a>.  He said: \"Don't invest in the eurozone. Do not invest anywhere in eurozone. You've got to be mad to do so, because it's now run by people who don't respect democracy, who don't respect the rule of law, who don't respect the basic principles upon which western civilisation is supposed to be based.\"</p><p>The frequency of his attacks on European economic and foreign policy has drawn him to the attention of the Russian deputy foreign affairs minister, Alexander Yakovenko: the two men met in May last year.</p><p>Farage caused surprise at the weekend when asked by GQ magazine which politician he most admired. He replied: \"As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say [Vladimir] Putin.\" He defended his approach at a Chatham House event in London. He pointed out: \"I said I don't like him, I wouldn't trust him and I wouldn't want to live in his country, but compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country, I've more respect for him than our lot.\"</p><p>Clegg said: \"I just think it is utterly grotesque that Nigel Farage apparently admires – and that was the question to him: 'Who do you admire?' – admires someone, Vladimir Putin, who has been the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most brutal dictators on the face of the planet, President Assad [of Syria].\"</p><p>Farage is hardly likely to be personally sympathetic to Putin's politics, but the confluence of the two men's dislike for the European Union has made Farage a desirable figure for Russian state-run broadcasters.</p><p>Farage's views on the EU's role in the Ukraine are shared by some Tory Eurosceptic MPs. <a href=\"http://www.brugesgroup.com/eu/someone-had-blunder-the-eu-and-ukraine.htm?xp=comment\" title=\"\">In a Bruges Group film

It is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism\" title=\"\">form of radical and authoritarian nationalism</a> that suppresses rival ideology and individualism, seeking to harness the nation behind the power of the state.</p><p>Its most successful exponent in Europe was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco\" title=\"\">General Francisco Franco</a>, who led an abortive coup against Spain's hapless republican government in 1936 and, after a savage three-year civil war in which clerical reaction and half-baked mystical fascist ideology were harnessed to the cause, died in his bed only in 1975. Ukip is not exactly in the old monster's league and Farage's less than austere lifestyle will not endear him to austere and high-minded reactionaries.</p><p>In reality, there was unlikely to have been a single fascist in sight on the Royal Mile when the police had to rescue the Ukip leader from 50 or so noisy young people. Farage certainly isn't remotely a fascist by any reasonable test. Proper fascists, more likely to be found in the old National Front, the fractious BNP or the English Defence League (EDL), would soon take care of him. \"All mouth and no trouser,\" the self-styled hard men must mutter as they watch him on Question Time.</p><p>But not fascist either were the kids accusing him of the usual clutch of thought crimes, racism, homophobia, anti-semitism and being scum himself as well as being a \"bawbag\". It's a left-leaning charge sheet and comes as a package. Anti-semitism is a new one on me, but a Ukip councillor (\"I'm not racist') was caught posting anti-Jewish <em>and</em> anti-Muslim sentiments the other day, so that must be it.</p><p><em>Bawbag</em> is broad Scots for being an annoying and useless person as well as slang for  scrotum. Nowadays, it is also a brand of colourful boxer shorts of the kind Farage probably does not wear, being sartorially conservative – blazer or pin-stripe suit and regimental tie – in ways more consistent than his politics and policy prescriptions usually are.</p><p>Some of the protesters were clearly nationalist, a point confirmed by the invitation to \"shove the union jack up your arse\". But others probably just don't like his brand of Thatcherite free market populism any more than they liked it when a puzzled Margaret Thatcher failed to persuade most Scots that their greatest economist – Adam Smith – had the answer to their problems.</p><p>But there was no violence on Thursday, another indication that wholesome student protesters, not \"fascist scum\", were the driving force in Edinburgh.</p><p>Farage was careful not to blame the SNP for the stunt when he called on Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, to condemn the anti-English sentiments of his tormentors. Ukip has Scottish members – I have met some – but Farage is determined to show that his brand of British nationalism can attract votes in Scotland as it has modestly proved it can in Wales and Northern Ireland, the latter potentially more fertile ground because it has much in common with the aggrieved tone of lower middle-class Unionism.</p><p>In another sense, too, Nigel Farage started this ruck himself. At a Westminster press gallery lunch last month, he went out of his way to denigrate Salmond as a political fantasist who campaigns for an independent Scotland while wanting to stay inside the EU, which – says he – denies the nation states of Europe their sovereign independence. \"Dreamland,\" he called it. The remarks earned him some media attention in Scotland.</p><p>To some rival politicians the similarities between the pair are more striking, with both engaged in \"stop the world I want to get off\" politics and dreaming of unfettered national self-determination as the remedy for their people's woes, but usually duck the hard choices and risks that accompany these legitimate aspirations. Alistair Darling, leader of Scotland's Better Together campaign, made the comparison at the gallery lunch.</p><p>Farage himself says his party would not exist, nor need to exist, if the Tory party had remained true to  Thatcher – it was launched in 1993 as her rejection of John Major was becoming evident and sterling's ejection from the EU's exchange rate mechanism prompted a surge of anti-Europeanism in the Tory ranks that split the party and helped Tony Blair to win three terms. David Cameron's failure to win a majority or govern with authority has unleashed the genie again.</p><p>So Ukip is partly a protest vote – the current repository of \"sod them all\" disaffection – and partly a revolt of the Tory grassroots against the perception that it is led by a metropolitan elite that does not understand or care about them. In varying forms it is visible in all parties and – five years into a major economic downturn – in most advanced industrial states.</p><p>Will it become a permanent fourth party in British politics or fade when one or other of the big parties acquires another transformative leader? Impossible to say in this time of flux. Will it perform a reverse takeover on the Tories, as the populist Reform party did in Canada? Ditto.</p><p>But compared with the Golden Dawn party in Greece – who do have fascist credentials – and other fringe parties evident in hard-hit areas of the EU, Ukip is pretty mild. It contains some nasty people, but plenty who are just fed up or cross, often with good reason: the recession has hit them and their neighbours hard. They rightly resent being snootily dismissed by Cameron as \"fruitcakes\".</p><p>The mood is more Rotary Club than Mussolini's blackshirts or the brownshirt bullies who terrorised the streets before Hitler came to power. Farage is a free market man, not a statist. He believes in abolishing all sorts of intrusive state action – health and anti-speeding measures, as well as propping up venal banks. He wants to cut taxes, though he also wants to spend a lot on better public services, too. Nostalgia for a lost or never-was past is his currency.</p><p>Ukip – which some liken to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poujade\" title=\"\">French shopkeeper revolt of the 1950s</a>  led by Pierre Poujade – insists it struggles to identify and expel nasties who get through its rudimentary selection net, which is (a point of honour) locally devolved. Given that its candidates did better than expected in the 2 May county elections we can expect more.</p><p>But it won't be like Hitler's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives\" title=\"\">Night of the Long Knives in 1934</a> when the brownshirt SA's leftwing faction was butchered.

href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/17/nigel-farage-fascist-scum-protesters\" title=\"\">Thursday's confrontation</a> between Nigel Farage and Scottish protesters has led people to question just why Ukip is so unpopular in Scotland. However, it is the wrong question to ask. Instead we should be asking just what has happened to English culture that a party with a loathsome agenda of homophobia, barely masked racism and a litany of other far-right notions has made such headway in the 21st century. One answer is the media's obsessive treatment of personalities and not politics. The other is the extraordinary gulf that's developing between Scotland and England about the twin referendum campaigns and the political cultures they reflect.</p><p>Farage <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22566183\" title=\"\">told Good Morning Scotland's David Miller on BBC Radio Scotland</a> that Ukip had set its sights on Scottish success, but with this PR disaster it seems unlikely the party will improve on their 0.28% showing at the last election in Scotland. So why has such a party – that has no base at all in Scotland – been plastered all across our media for months? Partly this is the enduring Anglosphere – English culture and values writ large across the whole of Britain like a suffocating blanket – partly it is the depoliticised nature of contemporary media.</p><p>It's striking how much of this whole situation has been hyped by media intrigue. \"I agree with Nick\" has been replaced with \"I agree with Nigel\". This is from a media culture that is often unable to engage in political discussion of any depth and resorts repeatedly to individual portraits: Brown – surly, Kinnock – windbag, Nick – affable and so on. What's been largely absent has been a real examination of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/30/ukip-manifesto-closer-look\" title=\"\">Ukip's policy platform</a> or the actual consequences of withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>The outburst of venom unleashed by Ukip supporters after what was, after all, just a peaceful if vocal demonstration in a free society was telling. One prominent Ukip voice, Ron Northcott, the candidate for Plymouth appears to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PWMartin_Leith/status/335174208592150530/photo/1\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \"Amazed that 50 Jocks could get out of bed that early. It's not signing-on day, is it or is the chemist open?\"</p><p>Visceral hatred like this is more and more commonplace but with such clear feelings it does kind of make the question why is Ukip so unpopular in Scotland? a little redundant.</p><p>Last night Ukip was met directly on the streets of Edinburgh by a well-organised group run by the <a href=\"http://radicalindependence.org/\" title=\"\">Radical Independence Conference</a> (RIC) – leaving the allegations being flung about by Farage on the Today programme that this was \"fascist scum filled with total and utter hatred of the English\" as little more than pitiful irony. The group's slogan – \"Another Scotland is possible\" – reflects the movement's roots in radical and left-green politics. They are as far away from being fascists as Farage is from being elected north of Gretna. They, like many, are interested in \"independence without nationalism\".</p><p>But the episode certainly put paid to the lazy and stupid attempts by some to equate the Ukip phenomenon with Scottish nationalism, or even the anti-EU referendum with the Scottish independence one.</p><p>Nothing's certain in either plebiscite and comparing them is futile and manipulative. The SNP won a landslide on a promise to hold a referendum. Ukip hasn't a single MP. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/14/tory-led-exit-europe-carnival-of-reaction\" title=\"\">As Seamus Milne has it</a>: \"A good part of Ukip's bubble is as much a xenophobic expression of powerlessness and falling living standards as it is of opposition to the EU, which is well down most voters' priority lists.\"</p><p>Are people really obsessed by the EU? I very much doubt it. This is not an agenda supported by anyone working in trade or business and the whole anti-EU culture is likely to drive a heap of sane and savvy businesspeople towards the Yes campaign.</p><p>This Westminster Euro-frenzy may split the Tories, but it's also likely to make the schism between Scotland and England on international trade and immigration into a chasm.</p><p>In February, <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3131/Scots-want-EU-referendum-but-would-vote-to-stay-in.aspx\" title=\"\">Ipsos Mori polling showed us</a> that 53% of Scots would vote for the UK to remain part of the EU, with 34% opposed, while 61% think an independent Scotland should be an EU member. A 19% margin in favour of the EU in Scotland, and an 8% margin against in England is particularly important in terms of the UK government's latest announcement.</p><p>Further <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/scotland-attitudes-towards-EU-membership-2013-tables.pdf\" title=\"\">data from Ipsos Mori</a> gives strong evidence of a significant divergence of opinion between the two nations. In a similar poll in November, 50% of people in England said they would vote to leave the EU compared with 42% wanting to remain.</p><p>If Ukip hadn't had such an easy time in the media, Farage might have not believed his own hype and made such a disastrous PR blunder. Last night's protest is also a watershed for those Scottish unionist pundits – who try to cling to the idea that there is a uniform political culture north and south of the border. But media treatment remains an ongoing issue. As Scott Hames, editor of <a href=\"http://www.word-power.co.uk/books/unstated-I9780956628398/\" title=\"\">Unstated: Writers on Scottish Independence</a> has pointed out, last night is already being reframed thus:</p><blockquote><p><em>The political class last week: </em>\"Farage is a dangerous, odious berk. Legitimising Ukip's rhetoric is deeply worrying. The new acceptability of such views evokes [insert sinister 1930s reference].\"<br /><em>Farage visits Scotland, and is hounded.</em><br /><em>The political class:</em> \"Farage isn't my cup of tea, but the man deserved a fair hearing. Intolerance of Ukip's rhetoric is deeply worrying.

weeks ahead of the European parliament elections, Ukip's leader is trying to stay fit and sober, and to exercise a bit of self-censorship. He still won't talk policy – but will admit that it's Labour voters his party now needs to win over","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-20T23:51:09Z","body":"<p>Nigel Farage hasn't changed a bit, and yet&nbsp;everything is different. He suggests we meet in a village in Stockton-on-Tees for a \"lovely pub lunch\", which turns out to consist of three pints of ale, lots of cigarettes, and no food whatsoever. Already he is hoarse, and it's only day two of his grand tour of the north. \"I gave myself a stern talking-to yesterday on the way up to Sheffield, and told myself not to overdo it,\" but then 600 supporters turned up for Ukip's launch rally – \"It was like a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/18/billy-graham-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">Billy Graham</a> meeting!\" – and so of course the evening got a bit out of hand, and he got to bed at \"oh, you know, aherm, five past\". But straight after lunch he bounds back on to the tour bus – \"I've got to go and liberate a country\" – and sets off for a nearby town walkabout, which winds up in another pub. Dressed in a startling mustard corduroy ensemble, and mobbed by a scrum of local media, he looks like the happiest man in the world.</p><p>But by his normal standards, this is an&nbsp;operation of military discipline. If all&nbsp;goes to plan, his party is four weeks away from pulling off \"one of the biggest upsets in British political history\", and its leader is taking no chances. If Tony Blair, as Roy Jenkins once said, approached the 1997 election \"as if&nbsp;carrying a Ming vase across a polished floor\", then Farage is inching towards 22&nbsp;May like a barmaid balancing an overloaded beer tray.</p><p>He now travels with a security detail of four big men in suits and earpieces, which is costing Ukip a fortune and driving him mad. \"I'm a completely free&nbsp;spirit, and of course these guys are used to meticulous timing, so I hate it.\" But he was whacked over the head with a placard in Margate recently, \"and if I&nbsp;hadn't had them with me I'd have been&nbsp;in hospital\". He watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/mar/26/the-debate-for-europe-nick-clegg-v-nigel-farage-video-highlights\" title=\"\">the first televised debate with Nick Clegg</a>, \"And I&nbsp;thought I was irritable. Bit red. A touch sweaty, possibly. So I went into training for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/apr/02/debate-europe-nick-clegg-nigel-farage-second-debate-video-highlight\" title=\"\">the second debate</a>. I did, I did! Cos I&nbsp;thought, this is really important, this actually really bloody matters. I've got to get this right, I've got to get myself in&nbsp;shape for this.\" For four whole days he didn't drink, he went walking on the&nbsp;North Downs, had a few morning swims, \"and actually got myself into a&nbsp;position where I wasn't knackered, I&nbsp;wasn't boozed up, and I was actually fit to do the debate. And I think it worked.\" He did have one glass of red just before the second debate, but only really on principle. \"We got to the green room and there was just mineral water! I said: 'We can't be doing with this sort of thing, we want a bottle of white and a&nbsp;bottle of red or I'm not going on.' \"</p><p>He has also had to learn how to say as&nbsp;little as possible – something else he clearly hates. \"But we are fighting this election on who governs our country,\" so Farage point-blank refuses to specify a single Ukip policy before 22 May, other than withdrawal from Europe (\"Oh, and bringing back grammar schools, you can have that\"). He even refuses to rule out any of the policies that featured in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/23/the-ukip-politices-disowned-by-nigel-farage\" title=\"\">the party's 2010 manifesto</a>, a document he&nbsp;describes as a \"load of late-night ramblings\" and has never actually read. Will he not even rule out one of its more memorable pledges, the compulsory dress code for taxi drivers? \"I've burned all 400-odd pages of it, burned it all, so I'm not prepared to discuss any of it.\"</p><p>Self-censorship doesn't really suit Farage, so he resorts to suppressed giggles and frantic gurning whenever he&nbsp;won't let himself answer a question, casting himself more as a mate planning a surprise birthday party than a slippery politician evading scrutiny. When it comes to Ukip policies already on the record, if he can't defend them then he says they're simply nothing to do with him. For example, the party now requires all candidates to confirm that they have no skeletons in the closet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2014/apr/21/neil-hamilton-ukip-christine-nigel-farage\" title=\"\">that could cause embarrassment to the party</a>, but what does that actually mean? \"I've&nbsp;no idea. 'Could cause an embarrassment' could mean almost anything, couldn't it? I just hope I'm exempted.\" Are any candidates likely to disqualify themselves on the basis of this clause? \"Depends how ambitious they are, I suppose. Oh, I don't know, I'm surprised they used the phrase to be honest. But as I say, I don't run everything.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435339426'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/25/1398437021132/Nigel-Farage-ukip-posters-008.jpg' alt='Nigel Farage ukip posters' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nigel Farage is enormously pleased with the Ukip posters he launched this week – if anything 'we should have gone further, really' Photograph: Tom Maddick/Ross Parry</figcaption></figure><p>Farage knows he can't rely on the party's original support base – \"very middle-class, very below the M4, ex-military\" – to deliver victory next month. So the privately educated ex-stockbroker from Kent is now chasing northern urban voters, and claims his party has become working-class. \"What we've got to do in the next four weeks is rattle the Labour party. That's the big job for Ukip now. The middle-class Tories in Wiltshire have already decided whether they're going to vote Ukip on 22 May or not – and a lot of them are. So for the next four weeks the focus is entirely on the Labour vote. If we're going to win these elections, those are the voters we want to get.\"</p><p>He is probably wise to steer clear of policy detail, for Ukip is now such an ideologically incoherent bandwagon that policy is no longer the point. Some of its supporters want to make dressing up for the theatre compulsory, while Farage is a libertarian who breaks the law \"regularly\" and says: \"I'm not for laws. We need a minimum of laws. I hate big government, I hate being told what to do on a personal basis.\" But even he is a bit wary of libertarianism now, \"because I've seen some of the loonier elements. A bloke took over our youth wing and called himself a libertarian, and he's for, I don't know,\" he shudders, \"bestiality!\" But he thinks he can get away with sidestepping all these contradictions, because none of them will matter on 22 May. \"People are voting for&nbsp;difference. I think there's a feeling among our supporters that we speak for&nbsp;them and no one else does.\"</p><p>One problem for Farage is how to maintain his image as a chaotic amateur while communicating quite a shrewd electoral strategy. The key to winning next month, he explains, is to get the non-voters out. \"Over one in five of our votes already come from non-voters. And in European elections only a third [of the electorate] vote, so it's a massive marketplace. And the more urban the area, the lower the turnout.\" If Ukip can beat Labour to first place – and the gap has closed to just a couple of points – \"the grassroots pressure on Ed Miliband to promise a referendum will be irresistible. We need to get British politics into a position where, whatever the outcome of the next election, we get&nbsp;a referendum.\"</p><p>He is enormously pleased with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/apr/22/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-poster-campaign-video?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">the Ukip posters he launched this week</a>, one of which features a gigantic pointing finger beside the words: \"26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?\" But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTXYlJNZ7tU\" title=\"\">as the BBC's political editor asked Farage this week</a>, if he's so worried about Europeans taking our jobs, why does he employ his German wife as his secretary, at taxpayers' expense? \"That particular line of argument from Nick Robinson was pathetic,\" he scoffs. \"If that's what he wants to focus on, then it's a pretty poor reflection of him and the BBC in my opinion. I think it's astonishing, simply astonishing. I mean, it&nbsp;just shows you how trivial the whole thing is.\" He has to employ his wife, he says, because nobody else could possibly work such antisocial hours so closely with him.</p><p>But&nbsp;other MEPs manage to employ secretaries to whom they are not married, don't they?</p><p>\"How can you compare my life to any&nbsp;other MEP? I mean, come on, it's crackers, isn't it? Look, other MEPs do five days a week in Brussels and pop home for weekends. I'm working seven bloody days a week, all the hours God sends. If you include the socialising, it's over 100 hours a week.\" His wife is not the only immigrant he has employed, it emerges; he has hired other Europeans, \"because they had specialist skills – languages in particular\". But he says British people should always try to employ a Brit over an immigrant wherever possible. \"And is that discriminatory? Maybe it is.\" Is that what he would always do? \"Of course I would, yeah.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435034617\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/22/140422Farage-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/22/140422Farage_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/22/140422Farage/140422Farage.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/22//140422Farage.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/22/140422Farage_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The posters have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/23/attacking-ukip-racist-campaign-counter-productive-immigration\" title=\"\">condemned across the political spectrum</a> as racist, divisive and ignorant. He knew the  finger-pointing poster would be controversial, but can't for the life of&nbsp;him see how it could cause offence. \"Shouldn't do. We should have gone further, really. What we could have done&nbsp;is say we've opened the door to 425 million people who are after your jobs. That would have been stronger.\" I&nbsp;suspect the decision not to had something to do with criticism of a notorious Ukip leaflet last year, which warned: \"<a href=\"http://www.electionleaflets.org/leaflets/7680/\" title=\"\">The EU will allow 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians to come to the UK</a>.\" As&nbsp;the combined population of both countries did not, in the event, relocate to Britain on 1 January, you'd think he&nbsp;might be embarrassed about the baseless alarmism, but not a bit of it.</p><p>\"Not at all. Two reasons, really. I think we don't know the true figures yet. And there's also the quality debate. People hate talking about this, but if you look at&nbsp;the Met crime figures for Romanian arrests, there have been 28,000 in London in the last five years. Is there a problem? Yeah. There is a problem.\" Is he saying there is a culture of criminality among Romanians? \"Bound to be. You have to go and see it to understand it. I've visited camps in Romania and Bulgaria, I've got a pretty good understanding.\" Should British people be wary of Romanian families moving into their street? \"Well, of course, yeah.\"</p><p>The poster campaign was funded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2014/apr/23/paul-sykes-ukip-britain-out-of-europe\" title=\"\">Ukip's main donor, the businessman Paul Sykes</a>, but I'm not convinced that relations between the two men are quite as harmonious as Farage says, because he looks a little strained when I mention Sykes' name. The pair considered dozens of different poster designs, he says – so who had the final say? \"Me.\" Sykes would have paid for posters he didn't choose? \"We agreed. But if we hadn't agreed, we wouldn't have had them.\" After a brief pause, \"I'm not for sale,\" he suddenly barks. \"I'm not for sale.\" But Sykes' money is crucial, isn't it? \"Well, his money makes a huge difference to us, of course it does,\" he says briskly. \"I&nbsp;get on incredibly well with him, we're pretty eye-to-eye on lots of issues, and getting agreement on this campaign and how to do it has been very easy. Very easy.\" Yet Sykes still hasn't promised to bankroll Ukip's general election campaign. He says he's waiting to see how the party performs in May, so I ask Farage what Ukip has to do to secure Sykes' backing for 2015. \"Well, you'd better ask him that.\" Hasn't Sykes told him? \"No.\"</p><p>The party's finances are a perennial headache for Farage, and like most Ukip MEPs he has donated a chunk of his own money – £11,000 last year, £4,000 this year. It was recently reported that the party is drawing up an MEPs' charter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/16/ukip-donations-meps-european-elections\" title=\"\">demanding a compulsory donation from each MEP of £50,000</a>, but&nbsp;Farage says it will stipulate only a \"reasonable sum\", which in his case will be \"two to three grand\". He recently described himself as \"broke\", but has a household income of just over £100,000. How can Ukip be a working-class party if it will only accept candidates wealthy enough to donate thousands? \"They wouldn't have their jobs as MEPs if it weren't for Ukip. They're not getting their jobs as individuals.\"</p><p>Money has become a tricky subject for Farage lately, since it emerged that supporters <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">donated for free an office that he lists as a significant running cost</a>. He insists he has done nothing wrong, so I ask if he can give voters a guarantee that every penny he's received from the EU has been spent correctly.</p><p>\"I can guarantee one thing. That I&nbsp;haven't done it for personal gain. But how I've spent my time and money, and&nbsp;whether I've spent it because I'm an&nbsp;MEP, or because I'm Ukip, I would suggest to you is a very grey area. It's a&nbsp;difficult divide. I've made no bones about it that I would use the wherewithal provided by the European parliament to go round Britain and campaign against Britain's membership of the European Union. I think I'm just about within the rules. I think I've kept just the right side of the line. Albeit pushing right up to it, sure.\"</p><p>And if he has strayed over the line and&nbsp;broken the rules? He doesn't think it&nbsp;matters. \"I mean, given the abuses for personal gain that have gone on with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mps-expenses\" title=\"\">expenses in Westminster</a>, I don't think the general public are that interested in whether I've strictly observed the rules on what is campaigning and what isn't. We always knew these criticisms would come at some point, but I have a completely clean conscience. If someone in Brussels wants to martyr me for that, then, well … well, they won't, they won't.\"</p><p>He told the Today programme last week that he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27030660\" title=\"\">would be happy to have his expenses independently audited</a>, but he is now keen to correct this. \"No, I didn't. I said if every other British MEP wants to then I would. I mean, I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all that is wrong with the European Union. After all, I've been saying that myself for years, so this is absolutely ludicrous. If all 73 people want to go on to a new regime, then of course I'll do it, but to be singled out in this way is frankly ridiculous.\"</p><p>The other charge levelled against Farage is that he can be a hot-headed bully, so I ask when he last raised his voice at a colleague. \"Um, that's a very good question. I had some sharp words with somebody two days ago. I told him to sharpen his effing act up. He said to me today, thank you for that. But I very rarely lose my temper. You know, really lose my temper. Very rarely, very rarely.\" What about a barky growl? \"Oh,&nbsp;I&nbsp;do that quite regularly.\"</p><p>He is one of the jolliest politicians I've ever met – exuberantly self-deprecating (\"Why would I take paternity leave? I'm absolutely useless!\"), quick to laugh, great fun, and uncommonly at ease in his own skin. But I would guess that, when provoked, he can go off like a bomb. Interestingly, he says of the Clegg debates: \"He really, really tried to dig me&nbsp;in the ribs in that second one, but I&nbsp;knew I was calm, I knew I was in control. I think if he'd gone down that line in the first debate, I might well have snapped. Which I would have enjoyed – but probably no one else would have.\"</p><p>The day after our meeting, Farage had to suspend one of the stars of Ukip's first ever party political broadcast, a council candidate, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/24/ukip-member-broadcast-suspended-racist-tweets\" title=\"\">racist tweets from his Twitter account were exposed</a>. When I&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/07/nigel-farage-party-eccentrics-ukip\" title=\"\">interviewed Farage in January last year</a>, he was still a maverick figure on the political margins, and for all his charisma, it was hard to see how he could protect himself from coming to grief through his colleagues' bigotry and&nbsp;battiness. I still can't work out whether what he's achieved since then&nbsp;says more about the failings of the traditional Westminster class than it does about Farage's own acumen. But his apparent immunity to any amount of&nbsp;Ukip scandals is looking less and less like just good luck.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435339427'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/25/1398446521180/Nigel-Farage-having-escap-009.jpg' alt='Nigel Farage having escaped dying when a plane towing a Ukip banner crashed on election day 2010' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nigel Farage knows he’s lucky, having narrowly escaped dying when a plane towing a Ukip banner crashed on election day 2010.  Photograph: Neil Hall/INS News Agency Ltd</figcaption></figure><p>Then again, as he points out himself, he is a very lucky man. It's surprisingly easy to forget that on election day in 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/06/ukip-nigel-farage-plane-crash\" title=\"\">Farage very nearly died in a plane crash</a>, when a Ukip banner the light aircraft was towing became tangled in the tail fin. At the time it seemed almost like a bad joke – a metaphor for an eccentric political career nose-diving into oblivion – but obviously not to Farage. \"Well, it was horrible. Yeah. It's one of those things I still think about.\" He can remember \"every single millisecond of&nbsp;it\", and thought he was going to die. What went through his mind? \"All sorts of things that shouldn't have done,\" he laughs. \"I'm not going to tell you.\" Go on. \"Well, I thought a bit about things I'd done well, things I'd done badly. I&nbsp;thought about all the different girlfriends I've had, you know, about different forks in the road at different times.\" Was he seized by regrets? \"Well,&nbsp;we all have regrets in our life – but I'm married, you see,\" he laughs, \"so I can't answer that.\"</p><p>He thought about phoning his wife. \"But then I reasoned that probably that phone call would haunt them.\" If he had&nbsp;called, he would have said: \"Sorry I've been such an appalling husband and&nbsp;a not very good father. But how would that help? It wouldn't have helped. So I&nbsp;just sat there quietly. And then when the end comes, and you're careering towards the earth, there's almost a sense of resignation. Let's hope&nbsp;it's over quickly.\"</p><p>He came to rest upside down, his head two inches from the ground – \"That was the difference between snapping my neck and not.\" Covered in&nbsp;fuel oil, he thought he was about to burn to death. \"And that was terrible. And I thought, nobody will ever know I&nbsp;survived this crash. And then, after a few minutes, it hadn't caught fire, and I&nbsp;began to think it might be OK. But I&nbsp;couldn't breathe, I just could not breathe. And I thought, you know, all those years of smoking – if I get out of this I'll never touch another cigarette as long as I live, I'll be a really good person. If I get out of this I'm going to live such a good life, I'm going to be such a good person.\" And has he kept any of his promises? \"No! None of them.\"</p><p>He thinks that since the crash, \"I'm a little bit more aware of others than perhaps in my worst moments I would have been before.\" Awareness of others has never been his strong point, he chuckles softly. \"I think it's been a weakness. But I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing otherwise. To do what I've done in this job, I think you have to lack self-awareness.\"</p>","headline":"Nigel Farage interview: 'To do what I've done, you have to lack self-awareness'","trailText":"<p><strong>Decca Aitkenhead</strong>: Four weeks ahead of the European parliament elections, Ukip's leader is trying to stay fit and sober, and to exercise a bit of self-censorship.

class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-09T01:07:40.724+01:00\">1.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Question Time - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a summary of the main points from tonight's Question Time.</p><p><b>* Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said that leaving the European Union was the only way the government could recover the power to block takeovers like Pfizer's proposed purchase of AstraZeneca. </b>He said that, under the current rules, the EU had the final say on competition law matters of this kind. And he accused the three main parties of telling \"weasel lies\" about this.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It won't be the shareholders that decide, it won't be the people that decide, it won't be parliament that decides, it won't be the government that decides - and the weasel lies you have heard from these three parties on this panel, they say the law needs to be changed - you are either wilfully lying to these people or you are pig ignorant. Vince Cable in this debate, when he was pushed by John Redwood, admitted the ultimate decision as to whether AstraZeneca could be taken over by Pfizer would be taken by the European Union.</p></blockquote><p><b>Caroline Lucas</b>, the Green MP, said that, although she did not not favour leaving the EU, she did want the law to be changed to give the government more power to block takeovers of this kind. </p><blockquote><p>I think that the whole era of economic globalisation where we are at the mercy of corporate takeovers is something that absolutely needs to be challenged. I don't want to see a Britain where we have our manufacturing, what's left of it, completely hollowed out. </p></blockquote><p>But <b>Shirley Williams</b>, the Lib Dem peer, blamed Labour for taking away the government's power to intervene. Labour passed legislation allowing the government to block takeovers like this only on narrow public interest grounds, she said.<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What that means is we are frankly emasculated about doing anything much about AstraZeneca. And what's really sad about that is that our very brilliant emergence as a scientific and research nation is put at risk. Don't blame the politicians. The law does not allow the coalition government to do what you want it to do.</p></blockquote><p><b>* Farage was accused of scaremongering of the kind that has led to war in Europe in the past.</b> The charge was made by a member of the audience who confronted Farage in one of the programme's most memorable moments.<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm old enough to have read about McCarthyism, and I'm old enough to have read Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. I'm also aware of what happens in elections where a climate of fear is caused amongst the electorate by the charismatic, the bombastic and, to me the very dangerous. This has driven Europe to war in the past. I have no time for you, Sir.</p></blockquote><p>When the other politicians or the media have accused Ukip of extremism, those attacks have usually backfired, because they have tended to confirm Ukip supporters in their belief that the establishment is ganging up on them. Tonight's intervention may have been a bit more damaging because it seemed to come from an ordinary member of the public.<br></p><p><b>* Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, complained about the length of time it took the international media to focus on the plight of the Nigerian schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram. </b></p><blockquote><p>It is a disgrace it took so long for this to become a big international story. </p></blockquote><p>Lucas made a similar point, saying the media paid far more attention to the missing Malaysian airplane, even though it was very likely the passengers were dead. Williams said she thought \"far more attention\" would have been paid if the missing pupils were boys.<br></p><p>That's all from me for tonight.</p><p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-09T01:08:25.034+01:00\">at 1.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-536c0ddae4b0f622341da5d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-09T00:17:15.113+01:00\">12.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Twitter highlights</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here is a round up of some of the most popular tweets about tonight's programme.</p><p>According to Tweetdeck, these have all had at least 50 retweets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps/statuses/464521461525667841\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>One day I&#39;d like to see Nigel Farage on a panel where nobody asks about immigration or EU.

Partly that was because he had some deft debating moments, partly it was because he finished well (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/08/question-time-with-nigel-farage-grant-shapps-chuka-umunna-shirley-williams-and-caroline-lucas-bbcqt-live#block-536c06bae4b012a5c554bc17\"> 11.44pm),</a> partly it was because the first question (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/08/question-time-with-nigel-farage-grant-shapps-chuka-umunna-shirley-williams-and-caroline-lucas-bbcqt-live#block-536bf9eee4b06fa7540a6362\"> 10.43pm)</a> could not have been better phrased for Farage if it had been drafted in Ukip HQ (because the answer is clearly yes, if stopping EU immigration what you really want), but mostly it was because more than half the programme was devoted to Ukip's core subject. In politics, once you control the agenda, you're already well on the way to victory. That said, the panel did not give him an easy time. Dismissing Ukip as racist and extremist hasn't exactly been a success as a strategy recently, and mostly the other four panelists adopted a reasonable, emollient tone. Personally, I mostly liked what the four stay-iners had to say. But a good 40% of the electorate or so tell pollsters that they would like to leave the EU, and, if they watched that, they will have seen four parliamentarians ganging up on a non-MP saying things they probably applauded. For Farage, who is nurturing these grievances skilfully, that's where he wanted to be.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536c06bae4b012a5c554bc17\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T23:44:01.027+01:00\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Caroline Lucas says the government should be able to intervene.

Grant Shapps (who until now had been having a good run) sounded weaselly, Chuka Umunna was more convincing (it's his subject), Caroline Lucas was better still (because she was more specific), but Nigel Farage clinched it, partly by making the point that the EU ultimately decides how competition law operates in the UK (he was right - Vince Cable did make this point in the Commons on Monday), and partly because - by accident or design, I'm not sure which - he managed to make it look as if the rest of the panel was ganging up to silence him.</p><p>I will post a snap verdict in the moment, then some highlights from Twitter, and then the top news lines.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536c0652e4b06fa7540a6369\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T23:35:33.776+01:00\">11.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Chuka Umunna </b>says normally shareholders should decide.</p><p>But, with a company like this, of such importance to the economy, the government should have a role to play.</p><p><b>Grant Shapps</b> says in 2012 Umunna said Labour was opposed to having a broad public interest test.</p><p>Umunna says that is not what the party is proposing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536c05cfe4b012a5c554bc16\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T23:33:38.686+01:00\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pfizer and AstraZeneca</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Next question.</p><p><i>Q: Should shareholders or politicians decide if Pfizer is allowed to buy AstraZeneca?</i></p><p>Grant Shapps says the government wants to protect jobs and research.</p><p>But can the government block the bid, David Dimbleby asks.</p><p>Shapps starts to waffle.

Yes he is because we are a trading nation and his answer is to give up ...</p><p>He is wrong. The idea of turning your back on the world and saying we are going to try and build fortress Britain, we are going to leave Europe, we are going to shut the door to anybody coming here. It is a totally unrealistic, pessimistic vision about what this country can achieve.</p></blockquote><p>But<b> Jeremy Browne</b>, the Lib Dem former Home Office minister, was rather more complimentary about the Ukip leader in an interview in the House magazine. This is what he said.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think he’s an interesting politician who is too quickly dismissed in our Westminster debate. I think he benefits from having a clear message. On the central proposition of Europe, I have a much clearer idea of what Nigel Farage believes than I do what Ed Miliband believes.</p><p>I think the age of cleverly refined evasions being admired by the electorate has gone, and the age of boldness and principle is in the ascendency. People respond to politicians who they think are telling them what they believe in rather than what they calculate the public want to hear. Nigel Farage, in that way, is clearly a gifted politician. And politicians in the mainstream parties need to think about the nature of his appeal and what aspects of it may be divisive and problematic and should be challenged, but also which parts of it may be worthy of additional reflection ...</p><p>If people are protesting against the mainstream political parties, people need to ask themselves why, rather than just dismissing protest out of hand. I think there’s a detachment between Westminster politics and the mood in some parts of the country. I think Westminster politicians need to understand that and not dismiss it.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536bf236e4b012a5c554bc02\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T22:08:52.696+01:00\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Grant Shapps has already been tweeting about the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grantshapps/statuses/464509669734907904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bbcQT&amp;src=hash\">#bbcQT</a> now recorded &amp; on air at 10.35pm BBC1.

Farage adopted a more combative approach during the lively debate, but, although Clegg \"lost\" in the YouGov poll, Lib Dems believe they will benefit from Clegg being seen to champion the pro-European cause so prominently.

They wryly point out that Clegg hasn’t polled 36% in anything recently, so he goes home a winner in that respect. It is worth noting that in his closing statement, the Lib Dem leader quite explicitly asked pro-Europeans to lend him their votes in May’s European parliamentary election. This, ultimately, is the point of the exercise. His message: you may not like me or the Lib Dems but in this particular race we are the only way to express support for Britain’s EU membership. (I looked into Lib Dem thinking on this point in more detail <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/westminster-thrall-cult-farage-%E2%80%93-clegg-knows-most-voters-see-through-it\">here</a>.)</p><p>For Farage, the purpose of the exercise was to establish Ukip as a significant player in national politics whose leader debates on equal terms with top government ministers. He needed to retain some of the irreverence and forthright language that makes voters think of him as an outsider, while also presenting sufficient substance when standing next to the Deputy Prime Minister. By and large, he pulled that off. There will have been a few Tory MPs watching and listening tonight, asking themselves why David Cameron can’t bring himself to say some of the things the Ukip leader was saying. The main message that Farage’s team wants to project is that their man put himself “at the head of the Eurosceptic movement” in Britain. And he probably did; just as Clegg effectively projected himself as head of the pro-EU side of the debate. That’s what they each wanted. In all likelihood, very few minds were changed yet both sides go home satisfied.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2014-03-26/tom-bradbys-reaction-to-eu-debate/\">• Tom Brady at ITV says Farage did not have a great night.</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>For what it is worth, I don't believe Nigel Farage had an especially great night. He has a rather attractive public persona in general and comes across to floating voters as the kind of guy who might not bore you overly in the pub.</p><p>In this, he falls firmly into the same category as Boris. But Nigel was quite aggressive tonight and rather didactic and altogether less attractive than normal. And he was very shaky on some of the claims he and his party tend to spew out on the malign influence of Europe in every aspect of our lives.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100265163/nigel-farage-shows-david-cameron-how-he-might-lose-by-standing-on-the-sidelines/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">• Benedict Brogan at the Telegraph says Cameron could lose by not being in the Europe debate.</a><br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Where was David Cameron? Many Conservatives will wonder when their leader will make his appearance in this argument. Tory MPs in particular will have had their anxieties reinforced. Does the Prime Minister really agree with Nick, that Britain is \"better off in\"? What does he offer to those Conservatives who will have listened to Mr Farage and nodded along? It is possible to lose from the sidelines.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5333413de4b053cc1d015c6f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T21:34:43.908Z\">9.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the key quotes from the debate. </p><h2>Opening statements</h2><p>From <b>Clegg</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Make no mistake - if we cut ourselves off from Europe, from the countries that we trade with more than anyone else, then our hard-won economic recovery will simply be thrown away ...</p><p>We are better off in Europe - richer, stronger, safer - and that's why I will fight to keep us in, for the sake of jobs, for the sake of our clout in the world, for the sake of Britain.</p></blockquote><p>From <b>Farage</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>This debate is between a tired status quo defending a crumbling EU that frankly isn't working any more, and a fresh approach that says let's be friendly with Europe, let's trade with Europe, but let's not be governed by their institutions.</p></blockquote><p><h2>On a referendum</h2></p><p>From <b>Farage</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Why don't we trust the British people to make their minds up on what I think is the most important constitutional question we have faced in this country for 300 years: are we to be a self-governing nation or not?</p></blockquote><p>From<b> Clegg</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Nigel says let's have a referendum next Tuesday, next Wednesday, next Thursday - every time there's a decision taken somewhere else in the European Union. </p><p>It's really important to remember this is a decision which would have a huge effect, which would have massive consequences for our country for generations to come, for decades to come.</p></blockquote><h2>On immigration</h2><p>From <b>Clegg</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Actually people who come to our country, they create wealth, they pay taxes, they help sustain our NHS.</p><p>To pull up our drawbridge, we would destroy jobs for everybody in this country and that is something I am not prepared to see happen.</p></blockquote><p>Referring to  a Ukip election leaflet claiming that 29m Romanians and Bulgarians might come to the UK, Clegg said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There aren't even 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians living in Romania and Bulgaria.

Sometimes that's an unreasonable question - as explained earlier (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/26/nigel-farage-vs-nick-clegg-the-debate-for-europe-live#block-5333093ee4b095031dc616ac\"> 5.25pm)</a>, it's easy to see how Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg could both emerge as \"winners\" - but that won't stop people asking it at 8pm. </p><p>Here are the various benchmarks we can use.</p><p>1. The YouGov poll. This will be the one that that media will focus on. YouGov are polling for the Sun, and they expect to release their headline result at about 8.30pm. More detailed figures will be in the Sun tomorrow.</p><p>2. The Twitter worm. A firm called Blurrt produces Twitter analytics, looking at all tweets on a subject and assessing how many are positive and how many are negative. It will be using this data to produce a tracker \"worm\" showing what Twitter thinks about the two leaders as the debate is going on. <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/watch-lbc-leaders-debate-live---26th-march-87667#worm\">You can follow it on the LBC website. </a>It is a reliable guide to what people are saying on Twitter, but Twitter itself is not representative. Parties like Ukip tend to be disproportionally well represented on Twitter.</p><p>3. The Guardian worms. We have also got our own sentiment tracker worms, showing what Guardian readers make of what Farage and Clegg are saying. But, again, this has limited evidential value. Being infinitely wiser, Guardian readers are not representative of the public at large.</p><p>4. Commentariat reaction. I will produce a round-up of what the commentariat are saying.</p><p>And I will post my own take too, as the debate goes along and at the end. To assess who's won, I try to imagine what a fair-minded viewer would think, taking into account the strength of the argument and the skill with which it is expressed. But that's just a subjective judgment. You can decide for yourself equally well who you think has won.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53331ae5e4b0a76b80b40e7a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T18:23:15.467Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on Nigel Farage's pre-match preparations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/statuses/448886539708563456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Team Farage tell me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKIP\">@ukip</a> leader is limbering up in Westminster Arms ahead of Euro showdown with Nick Clegg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pintofYoungs&amp;src=hash\">#pintofYoungs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lbcdebate&amp;src=hash\">#lbcdebate</a></p>&mdash; norman smith (@BBCNormanS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/statuses/448886539708563456\">March 26, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And here's a picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samdwebber/statuses/448886200091574274\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage\">@Nigel_Farage</a> prepping for the big debate with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nick_clegg\">@nick_clegg</a> where else but Westminster Arms! : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NickvNigel&amp;src=hash\">#NickvNigel</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LBCdebate&amp;src=hash\">#LBCdebate</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/YhqzbPky2X\">pic.twitter.com/YhqzbPky2X</a></p>&mdash; Sam Webber (@samdwebber) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samdwebber/statuses/448886200091574274\">March 26, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53331915e4b0a76b80b40e77\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T18:18:57.542Z\">6.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier this week Paddy Power had Nick Clegg as the 4/6 favourite to win the debate (with the winner being determined by the YouGov poll).

There was almost universal agreement that Mitt Romney won the first debate in the US presidential elections in 2012. And in 2010 Nick Clegg went into the first leaders' debate as a relative unknown, and made such a good impression that the Lib Dems' poll ratings subsequently soared.</p><p>But more often people who watch a debate end up feeling much the same way about the protagonists as they did at the start.</p><p>So, what do people feel about Clegg and Nigel Farage? Here are five benchmarks.</p><p>The bad news for Clegg is that mostly they suggest that Farage will win. That does not mean he will win when the YouGov poll figure comes through at about 8.30pm. Clegg could put in such a good performance that he changes minds. But the statistics do suggest that he starts the match 3-0 down. </p><p><b>1. Attitude towards Europe</b></p><p>Lord Ashcroft recently published <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LORD-ASHCROFT-EUROPE-ON-TRIAL.pdf\">a report (pdf)</a> about attitudes to Europe, based on extensive polling and focus group work. <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2014/03/europe-trial/\">He concluded that, when it comes to Europe, there are five groups in the UK.</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A fifth of the country are in the “Committed Hostility” group who see nothing good about Europe and overwhelmingly want to leave – though immigration worries them more. Just over a quarter are “Discontented Sceptics”, thinking the costs outweigh the benefits but less certain that we should head for the exit. Another quarter of the population make up the “Relaxed Status Quo”, who are happy as things are and hardly give the subject a thought, while the smaller group of “Global Progressives” strongly support the EU and even welcome its influence on Britain. Finally there are the “Disengaged”, one in seven of the population who know little and care even less.</p></blockquote><p>Farage is the de facto leader of the \"Committed Hostility\". And Clegg is now setting himself up as Britain's leading \"Global Progressive\".</p><p>But Farage's group is bigger. Ashcroft concludes that 19% of the population belongs to \"Committed Hostility\". Only 12% are \"Global Progressives\".</p><p><b>2. State of the parties</b></p><p><a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/03/26/update-labour-lead-3/\">Today's YouGov polling figures have Ukip and the Lib Dems level pegging, both on 10%.</a> But over the last year Ukip has generally been ahead of the Lib Dems in national polls.</p><p><b>3. Attitudes to leaving the EU, or staying in</b></p><p><a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/03/26/eu-referendum-highest-lead-two-years/\">A YouGov poll released today shows 42% of the public in favour of staying in the EU (Clegg's position), and 36% in favour of leaving (Farage's position).</a> But, again, this is not what polls have generally been saying for the last two years. As <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/f5ou9rc5aa/YG-Archives-Pol-Trackers-Europe-100314.pdf\">this YouGov tracker (pdf) shows,</a> the \"outs\" have generally been ahead in recent years. </p><p><b>4. Trust on Europe</b></p><p>Recently YouGov conducted <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/yypjkq47tz/YG-Archive-140321-LBC.pdf\">a poll (pdf) to find out which of party leaders the voters trusted most on Europe. </a>Only 11% said Farage. But only 7% said Clegg.</p><p><b>5. Voter satisfaction</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemID=88\">Ipsos MORI conducts regular polls asking voters if they are satisfied with the way party leaders are doing their job.</a> In the two polls this year Clegg's net ratings have been -28 and -39. Farage's are much better, -2 and -10, which are the best ratings of all four party leaders featured.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T21:01:26.080Z\">at 9.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53330eb3e4b0a76b80b40e71\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T17:31:56.012Z\">5.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How the debate will run</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some notes from LBC explaining how the debate will be conducted. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>• Audience members - who will put questions to the leaders - are being recruited by ICM in line with a demographic profile of the wider UK population.

No prior knowledge of the questions will be given to either party.</p><p>• Some questions submitted via email by LBC listeners will also be allowed.</p><p>• Both leaders will make opening statements of one minute before the debate begins.</p><p>• Each leader will have one minute to answer questions from the audience before the moderator encourages free debate. </p><p>• Nick Ferrari will moderate the debate. He will ensure each leader has an equal amount of time across the hour in what will be a lively and free-flowing debate.</p><p>• The debate will end with closing statements lasting one minute by each of the party leaders.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5333093ee4b095031dc616ac\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T17:25:54.442Z\">5.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are less than two hours now until the first debate between Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg on Europe. Tonight's is being hosted by LBC, and it is being broadcast on Sky and BBC News too.</p><p>Farage, the Ukip leader, and Clegg, the Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister, are at opposite sides of the spectrum on the subject of the European Union. Farage wants to leave, while Clegg, a former EU official as well as a former MEP, has decided to fight the European elections on a platform of unashamed support for the EU. The Lib Dems have always been the most pro-European of the main parties, but in the past they tended to keep quiet about it. Now, though, Clegg has decided it's electorally advantageous to wave the EU flag (because the number of voters enthusiastic about the EU, though small, is larger than the number currently enthusiastic about the Lib Dems).</p><p>Farage and Clegg will not change each other's minds in their hour-long debate and most of those listening or watching will probably get to 8pm feeling much the same about the two men, and their views on Europe, as they did before. For that reason, it is going to be a hard debate to judge. As <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/adamboulton/article1390859.ece\">Adam Boulton explained in his column in the Sunday Times (paywall), </a>this could be an encounter with no loser.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The fascination of the Clegg-Farage face-off is that UKIP and the Liberal Democrats don’t have much to say to each other; they just disagree. Clegg and Farage won’t really be talking to each other or even trying to win over the same audience.</p><p>UKIP and the Lib Dems are not trying to steal voters directly from each other. UKIP is primarily taking its support from the Conservatives. The Lib Dems need to claw back from Labour and the Tories. Farage’s latest claim is that his core electorate will be the betrayed working class. The Lib Dems’ chances of harvesting a protest vote evaporated the day they went into government. Today they must be a party of principle or they are nothing. Anyway, except when swept up in a by-election tsunami, the “working class” has never been a heartland for the centre party. </p><p>While their Tory coalition partners grumble that Clegg has nothing left to lose by taking on Farage, the Lib Dems cheerfully acknowledge that the debates could be “a win-win” for both of them: a priceless opportunity to raise their profiles during an election campaign.  </p></blockquote><p>Boulton's right. But this doesn't mean that viewers and pundits won't form a view as to who has won. And whatever they think may turn out to be irrelevant, because the great polling oracle, YouGov, is going to pronounce too. YouGov has lined up a representative sample of voters who will be watching the debate and they will poll them electronically at 8pm. By around 8.30pm we will have their headline finding - and, hence, the name of the \"winner\".</p><p>The debate starts at 7pm. Before it starts, I will be covering the build-up, and providing more background information. I will then cover the debate in detail, and all the reaction afterwards.</p><p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>

It is difficult to make an exact comparison between the two years because all seats in the London boroughs, where Ukip struggles, were up for election.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, was fighting off a challenge to his leadership from the left of his party as Labour and the Tories moved to win back Ukip voters. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, said he aimed to halve the amount of time for which EU migrants can claim benefits.</p><p>The former shadow home secretary David Davis called on the prime minister to bring forward the date of his planned EU referendum by a year to 2016.</p><p>Frank Field, the Labour former welfare reform minister, warned his party would suffer permanent damage unless it acknowledged the concerns of voters on immigration as he said that Ukip could lead to a \"permanent balkanisation of the old two-party system\".</p><p>Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, will move to show he acknowledges the threat posed by Ukip on Tuesday when he visits the marginal constituency of Thurrock, where his party lost control of the council after a strong showing by Farage's party. Douglas Alexander, the Labour election co-ordinator, has faced criticism for playing down the Ukip threat on the grounds that a strong showing by the party would disadvantage the Tories.</p><p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, underlined the irritation in the shadow cabinet that the Labour leadership had failed to campaign on immigration early enough when he said the party needed to speak more loudly on the issue.</p><p>Field warned Labour could suffer permanent damage unless it reached out to voters attracted by Ukip's message on immigration.</p><p>He said: \"Ukip's success is a major signpost on the road to the permanent balkanisation of the old two-party system … We have yet to notice that Ukip has transformed itself in the last few months from being an anti-EU party to one opposed to the current scale of immigration. Labour has yet to convince its core vote or ex-core vote that it has an answer on this score.</p><p>\"Our [policy] review needs to present key policies that give us a new narrative that the centre-left voter wants to hear as opposed to what we want to tell them. If this chance is lost, to realign what Labour stands for, the outlook is grim. We will open up the possibility of a clear Tory win next year.\"</p><p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News on Sunday: \"We've got to do more to explain our policies and show them [voters] that we are on their side. And that is work in progress, more to do before the next election, but we are clearly moving in the right direction.\"</p><p>As part of the Tory response on immigration, Duncan Smith said he would halve – from six to three months – the amount time that EU migrants can claim benefits. He <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1414862.ece\" title=\"\">told the Sunday Times</a>: \"Before this year is out I intend to have reduced that six months to a three-month period of claim. That means you'll have to wait three months and you'll only be able to claim for three months. Then it's bye-bye. That's quite a significant tightening up.\"</p><p>But Theresa May, the home secretary, indicated on Sunday that the Tories had failed to win the agreement of their Lib Dem coalition partners, as she spoke of \"heated\" exchanges on immigration.</p><p>She told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: \"We're looking at a number of measures and it's no surprise to anybody that there have been some longstanding, possibly heated at times, discussions among the coalition on some of these issues on immigration.\"</p><p>The home secretary watered down the Tory commitment to bring down net migration to the tens of thousands by the general election, saying the proposal was now a long-term \"aim\".</p><p>May insisted progress had been made on reducing immigration, saying that 70,000 fewer people had emigrated to the UK last year than in 2010, when the coalition was formed. But she said the government was highly unlikely to meet the Tory target of cutting net migration by the time of the next general election because immigration had increased from within the EU.</p><p>\"We still have that aim of the tens of thousands, but of course it has become more difficult. Net migration is too high,\" said May. \"That is why I want to continue working to bring it down. What we see is in those areas which we can control, that is immigration from outside the EU, everything we have done as a government has been having an impact. And so we see that net migration from outside the EU is down to its lowest level since the late 1990s.\"</p>","headline":"Ukip media chief admits general election goal requires broader

The first minister of Scotland said people who didn't want to vote for any of the candidates would be perfectly entitled to write \"none of these clowns\" on the ballot paper.</p><p>Speaking at a Scottish referendum event at Dundee university, the Scottish National party leader was asked whether he supported compulsory voting after the recent European elections: turnout in Scotland was 33.5%.</p><p>\"I don't think it will happen, but it's one of my heresies that I like the idea of compulsory voting,\" he said during a question and answer session in the university's 5 Million Questions series on the referendum. \"I think there's a lot to be said for it.\"</p><p>He admitted few of his colleagues supported the policy. \"I raised this with colleagues but I didn't get very far.

But I don't think the Australians are wrong on this.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/faqs/voting_australia.htm\" title=\"\">Under the Australian system</a>, all voters are legally required to register and cast a vote in federal elections, byelections or referendums, or face a A$20 (£11) fine or up to A$170 if the case goes to court.</p><p>Salmond said he did not believe compulsory voting would be needed in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September, because many polls suggested the turnout will be at least 80%.</p><p>He said voting rates could be boosted with less controversial measures, including voter education and involving more under 18s. The Scottish referendum will give 124,000 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland the vote for the first time.</p><p>Salmond also admitted he had been unwise to be seen to praise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/30/alex-salmond-vladimir-putin-remarks\" title=\"\">Russian president Vladimir Putin</a> for restoring Russian national pride and praising aspects of his leadership in an interview with the former Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell in March for GQ magazine.</p><p>He told David Torrance, his biographer, that \"I should've maybe been more careful in my language\" in the interview with Campbell, but insisted his critics had deliberately misrepresented what he had said.</p>","headline":"Alex Salmond says he would support compulsory voting at elections","trailText":"Scotland's first minister revealed he would back the Australian model where people can be fined if they fail to vote","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401822644107/Alex-Salmond-visits-Scott-006.jpg","wordcount":"351","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"438474105","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9122374","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Severin Carrell, Scotland correspondent","internalPageCode":"2103610","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-06T19:27:05Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/03/alex-salmond-compulsory-voting","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/03/alex-salmond-compulsory-voting","tags":[{"id":"politics/alexsalmond","webTitle":"Alex Salmond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/alexsalmond","references":[]},{"id":"politics/electoralreform","webTitle":"Electoral reform","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/electoralreform","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/electoralreform","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/severincarrell","webTitle":"Severin Carrell","r2ContributorId":"19388","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/severin_carrell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Severin Carrell is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scotland\">Scotland</a> correspondent for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a>.

He said: \"When people see the comments I made, they will see that they're perfectly reasonable. I said I deprecated Russian actions in Ukraine and also its human rights record. I pointed out that the western press underestimated Putin and that's obviously true.\"</p><p>Salmond encountered a storm of protest after stating he admired \"certain aspects\" of Putin's politics and his restoration \"of a substantial part of Russian pride\" in an interview conducted on 14 March for the May edition of the men's magazine GQ with Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor.</p><p>Michael Ostapko, the Scottish chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said Ukrainians had made \"overwhelming comments [of] hurt, disgust, betrayal and astonishment\" and called for Salmond to retract his comments. In the Commons, his remarks were described as a \"gross error of judgment\" by William Hague, the foreign secretary, and as a \"dreadful blunder\" by Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616722/Now-Kremlin-expresses-delight-Salmonds-praise-Putin-Ukrainian-families-speak-disgust-betrayal.html\" title=\"\">Mail Online website</a> quoted Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, saying he \"agrees with the viewpoint of the Scottish first minister\".</p><p>Salmond said: \"When I was talking about the pride issue, it was in the aftermath of the Sochi [winter] Olympics, which was obviously a restoration of Russian pride. Those are reasonably balanced remarks.\"</p><p>He would reply to Ostapko in detail, he said, \"showing the comments were made specifically on Russia and Ukraine, which were comprehensive and unambiguous\".</p><p>The transcript of the Campbell-Salmond interview released in advance by GQ's publisher Conde Nast shows no mention of Ukraine or the Sochi Olympics, nor does the full text of the interview being published on Thursday.</p><p>In the days before the interview, pro-Russian paramilitaries seized key Ukrainian buildings in Crimea and work on the Crimean referendum had started. Nato had warned about a serious threat to European stability from Russia's actions.</p><p></p><p>In his GQ interview, Campbell sought to establish Salmond's view of the Russian president by asking: \"Putin?.\" Salmond replied: \"Well, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but he is more effective than the press he gets and you can see why he carries support in Russia.\"</p><p>\"Admire him?‚\" asked Campbell. Salmond replied: \"Certain aspects. There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the intermesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally; they are lovely people.\"</p><p>Asked on Wednesday whether he would give a different answer now, Salmond replied: \"If I was asked the same question today, I would go into detail on the annexation of Crimea, but that wasn't possible and indeed, of course, I have done that subsequent to it; it wasn't possible before it happened.

Nearly 20% had voted Lib Dem in 2010 and 15% Labour.</p><p>The poll also suggests that support for Nigel Farage may not survive into next year's general election - only 51% of Ukip voters said they would be likely to vote for the party in 2015. One in five Ukip voters is likely to vote Conservative, and one in 10 is likely to vote for Labour.</p><p>It follows an analysis of voting projections by the BBC that suggests Ukip support has dropped since last year's local elections, from 23% to 17%, throwing into question the scale of the \"earthquake\" predicted by Farage.</p><p>The poll by Ashcroft suggests that most people who chose Ukip did so in dissatisfaction with the main political parties. Six in 10 Ukip supporters described their vote as a general protest because they were \"unhappy with all established political parties at the moment\".</p><p>Before Thursday's election, Ukip leader Nigel Farage had urged voters to \"send a message to Brussels – and the whole political class\" by voting for his party.</p><p>\"I appreciate that many of you who intend to vote Ukip next week also intend to return to the Tory fold at the general election next year,\" he said. But he described a Ukip vote as a \"free hit against a deeply complacent and craven political establishment\".</p><p>On Saturday morning, George Osborne refused to comment on whether the Conservatives would make a deal with Ukip for the general election, but said he was \"not remotely complacent\". Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, he said he respected Nigel Farage, but said the Ukip leader did not have \"answers to the country's future\".</p><p>\"We take very seriously the fact that people voted Ukip; we respect that fact. We have to listen to people who voted Ukip. We have to listen to their anger and anxiety. We need to respond to that anger and anxiety with answers.\"</p><p>But he warned that Ukip voters would \"live with the consequences for years\" if they do not switch their support to the Tories. \"The job of myself and the Conservative party over the coming year is to really focus people's minds on that choice,\" he said. \"We have to make sure people are clear about the choice at a general election, clear that only two people [the leaders of the  two main parties] can be prime minister.\"</p><p>Commenting on the poll, which was published on the ConservativeHome website, Ashcroft said the Tories should \"reconnect with these supporters\".</p><p>\"This will probably mean a swallowing of pride with a sincere apology for the way gay marriage was introduced and, perhaps, an admission that HS2 is not the right policy, and immigration is not under control,\" he said.</p><p>Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher told Today that Labour had to \"fight much harder\" to tackle Ukip in the north of England. But he said the party had made \"extremely good progress\" and remained \"on course for a majority\" in the Commons.</p><p>\"We are winning in the areas we need to win,\" he said.</p>","headline":"More than half of Ukip voters were disenchanted Tories, Ashcroft poll finds","trailText":"Poll also suggests support for Nigel Farage may not last until general election, with only 51% of Ukip voters likely to do so again in 2015","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/24/1400929391604/Ukip-rosette-003.jpg","wordcount":"544","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"437700979","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9084097","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Williams","internalPageCode":"2098377","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-27T11:04:08Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/more-than-half-ukip-voters-disenchanted-tories-ashcroft-poll","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/24/more-than-half-ukip-voters-disenchanted-tories-ashcroft-poll","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/lord-ashcroft","webTitle":"Lord Ashcroft","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lord-ashcroft","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/lord-ashcroft","references":[]},{"id":"politics/polls","webTitle":"Opinion polls","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/polls","references":[]},{"id":"politics/european-elections","webTitle":"European elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/european-elections","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-williams","webTitle":"Martin Williams","r2ContributorId":"48256","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/site_furniture/2013/12/12/1386852267141/MW-002.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin is a freelance journalist.

We have more to do if we are going to really win the argument. Whether on Europe or immigration or on the economy, Labour has got more to do to show we can deliver the real fair change people want to see.\"</p><p>As part of the fallout, some shadow cabinet members say they were crowded out of a campaign that failed to project Labour as a team that includes strong women such as Harriet Harman and Yvette Cooper. There is also anger that Miliband focused too much on policy rather than projecting an empathy with voters' sense of alienation from the political class.</p><p>Harman said: \"People need more than policies. They need to be able to have confidence in their local and national politicians. We've got more to do.\"</p><p>The Labour inquest was taking place as the final results showed a mixed picture for all the parties. Ukip, long regarded as on the march, actually saw its projected share of the vote fall by six points compared with last year, from 23% to 17%, according to BBC calculations. Experts identified Ukip polling 20% in most of the country but just 7% in London.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat vote fell by one point to 13% while David Cameron's leadership was stabilised as the Tory vote increased by four points to 29%.</p><p>It was estimated that this would translate into 322 seats for Labour at a general election, 255 for the Conservatives, 45 for the Lib Dems and other parties, including Ukip, 28 seats.</p><p>Labour achieved nearly 300 council seat gains – well above its forecast of 200 – as it secured important victories by winning control of Hammersmith and Fulham, Croydon, Harrow and Amber Valley from the Tories. But the gain in seats was well behind the 490 identified by the psephologists Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings as the number required to show that it is a potentially winning force.</p><p>The Tories lost nearly 200 seats but managed to wrest control of Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems.</p><p>Nick Clegg faced a challenge to his authority when an e-petition was launched last night by grassroots Liberal Democrats urging him to resign \"so the party may once again get a fair hearing\". The petition is supported by the former Lib Dem MP for Romsey, Sandra Gidley and Bill le Breton, the former chair of the Association of Lib Dem Councillors.</p><p>A Guardian analysis showed that the Lib Dems are on course to lose 20 of their parliamentary seats – nearly a third of the total – in what would be a blow to the authority of the deputy prime minister. But it would avoid what is being described as the \"nuclear wasteland\" in which the party would lose two thirds of its seats to take it down to the 20 seats it won in 1992.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats were undertaking a damage limitation exercise arguing the  local election results showed the party could hold on in many of the parliamentary constituencies it currently holds.  But the figures for England also showed it was going to lose a  large  number of its seats where Labour is the challenger. The results due on Sunday may show how badly it is doing in Scotland and Wales.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats were likely to lose as many as 300 seats.</p><p>A Liberal Democrat source said: \"The results were a tale two elections. They are remarkably good against the Tories, but very bad against Labour especially in London.\" The source added \"the bottom line is that a hung parliament is still the most likely outcome\".</p><p>John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the surprise was Ukip's less than inspiring performance. Curtice said: \"They did pretty well but we shouldn't exaggerate it. Actually the performance is not quite as good as last year's stupendous performance. Given that these elections were taking place at the same time as Euro elections, which we know from previous experience tends to help Ukip to win votes at local elections, one might say: good but not brilliant.</p><p>\"There was one big lacuna in this performance and that was London. London, with its much younger, more highly educated and much more ethnically diverse population, very clearly illustrated the limits of Ukip's appeal which is primarily to older, white, working-class people.\"</p><p>Nigel Farage declared that Ukip had broken the political mould and was on course to win seats in parliament next year. \"The Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house. There are areas of the country where now we have got an imprint in local government. Under the first-past-the-post system we are serious players.\"</p><p>Cameron said he understood the message from the voters, who he said wanted the government to work harder on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. \"We will be working flat out to demonstrate that we do have the answers for hardworking people,\" he said.</p><p>The prime minister rejected calls from Eurosceptic Tories to form a pact with Ukip before next year's general election. He told Sky News: \"We are the Conservative party. We don't do pacts and deals. We are fighting all-out for an all-out win at the next election.\"</p><p>But the greatest soul-searching was in the Labour party. John Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, condemned what he called Labour's \"so-called strategists\" for failing to exploit Farage's admiration for Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>Mann told the Guardian: \"It was a tremendously ill-judged campaign, in particular the deliberate decision made not to attack Ukip.</p><p>\"Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron. Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world.\"</p>","headline":"Ed Miliband told: raise your game","trailText":"Labour tops vote in local polls but campaign

We hope the party leadership reviews these comments as a matter of urgency.\"</p><p>A Ukip spokesman said the party's national executive committee would look into the posts and decide what action to take. Similar offences in the past have seen members kicked out of the party.</p><p>The spokesman said: \"All Ukip members and councillors are expected to uphold the values of the party. Where there are allegations that that has not been the case, there is an established disciplinary procedure, which is under the auspices of the national executive committee. We will certainly look at this case.\"</p><p>The spokesman added that there were already \"quite a few cases pending\".</p><p>Small's Ukip colleague Stuart Cross, who represents Redditch South on Worcester county council, said Small was \"not wanted\" and should resign over the comments. He tweeted: \"If the new cllr has said that. Then he gets no support from me. He should resign without hesitation as those views are disgraceful.\"</p><p>In a post on his Facebook account last June entitled Britain used to be for the British, Small wrote: \"Our once great country has become the dust bin for all the world wide money grabbing scum.\"</p><p>He added: \"Why on earth is this useless Goverment pandering to Puffs? I refuse to call them gays, as what has gay to do with Perverts like Elton John and Clair Balding who get their jollies in such disgusting ways. to sum up, they should not allowed to be married, they should go back to the closet.\"</p><p>In February 2013, he referred to gay people as \"perverts\" and expressed opposition to \"poofs and dykes\" being allowed to marry. And he predicted that \"thousends mor scroungers\" would soon arrive in the UK from Mali as a result of a range of coalition government policies.</p><p>Small also complained in a November 2012 post that he was not allowed to use the term \"Paki\". And, in June that year, he wrote: \"I visiting the city of Birmingham recently and felt like a foreigner in the city of my birth, all around me I could hear the sound of jabbering in an alien voice&nbsp;… we also have the Pakistani' and the Somali's. Tell me Mr Cameron Why? the men wear their Pyjamas.\"</p><p>His comments are just the latest to cause problems for Farage. In February this year, Ukip councillor David Silvester was kicked out of the party for saying that gay marriage was to blame for the storms that lashed Britain last winter.</p><p>Farage himself faced criticism after insisting that people would be justified in worrying about Romanians moving in next door. And, in April, Ukip donor Demetri Marchessini told Channel 4 News that a man could never rape his wife because \"once a woman accepts, she accepts\".</p><p>Last week, BBC News' Jasmine Lawrence was removed from the corporation's election coverage after tweeting a derogatory comment about Ukip as the country was about to go to the polls.</p><p>The party made gains in the local elections, prompting Farage to claim that the \"Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house\". But the BBC's projected national share figure showed Ukip got less than the 23% it had in council elections last year. Moreover, the party does not control any local authorities.</p><p>Anti-Ukip campaigers Still Laughing at the UK Independence Party said Dave Small was \"another example in a long list of Ukip candidates who, having just been elected as a councillor, reveals himself on Facebook as a racist and a homophobe\".</p><p>Small did not respond to a request for comment.</p>","headline":"Ukip councillor under investigation over racist and homophobic comments","trailText":"Newly elected Redditch councillor Dave Small referred to gay people as perverts and African immigrants as scroungers","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/24/1400936090544/A-man-wearing-a-Ukip-badg-006.jpg","wordcount":"701","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"437704264","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9084484","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kevin Rawlinson","internalPageCode":"2098398","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-27T12:56:18Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-councillor-investigation-racist-homophobic-facebook-comments","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-councillor-investigation-racist-homophobic-facebook-comments","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/nigel-farage","webTitle":"Nigel Farage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/nigel-farage","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevin-rawlinson","webTitle":"Kevin Rawlinson","r2ContributorId":"58554","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Rawlinson is a freelance reporter who writes for the Guardian and other publications.

(An average poll features around 1,000 voters.) He found Labour had a 10-point lead, or a 12-point lead when voters were asked about their particular constituency. The 6.5% swing to Labour was larger than the 5.5% swing it currently enjoys in national polls. Ashcroft said that, if people voted on this basis at the general election, Labour would gain 83 seats. These results could give Labour a majority of around 70. But he also pointed out that, despite voters backing Labour, only 29% of those surveyed preferred the idea of Ed Miliband as prime minster to David Cameron.

In today’s poll ComRes found current support of CON 33%(-4), LAB 35%(-2), LDEM 8%(-10), UKIP 17%(+14). That’s a swing from Conservative to Labour of just one point, far lower than the swing shown in ComRes’s GB polls (it would be the equivalent of a national poll showing a Conservative lead of five points) suggesting Labour are doing worse in key marginals than in the country as a whole.</p><p>ComRes also break down the figures for the Conservative held and Labour held seats (though given the sample was only 1000 to begin with, caveats about sample size obviously kick in here). In the Tory held seats the Conservatives have a lead of 2 points (no change since the election), in the Labour held seats Labour have an 8 point lead (up 6 since the election). What that means is if these figures were repeated at the general election none of these Con/Lab seats would change hands at all – the Tories would hold theirs, Labour would hold theirs. In practice it wouldn’t work like that of course, there isn’t a uniform swing and some seats would probably switch in both directions, but it’s a suggestion that there isn’t really a swing to either Lab or Con in the key marginals.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53807d44e4b0be668b586bff\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T12:56:28.004+01:00\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>• George Osborne has said Labour is vulnerable in the north of England and that this presented an \"opportunity\" that the Conservatives should exploit.</b> For years the Conservatives have polled very badly in northern urban areas (they do better in northern rural areas), and some Tories tend to write off the party's prospects on this battleground.

We need to develop a convincing economic answer to the disparities between north and south in our country.

And that is the message we have to make clear to people over the next year. There are only two people who can become prime minister after the next election, David Cameron or Ed Miliband. If you don't want Ed Miliband, then you have to vote Conservative. That is an incredibly clear message. It's a message [the public] understand. And, by the way, I think after the last few week's they are even less convinced that Ed Miliband is the right answer. </p></blockquote><p><b>• He has said the Tories will never belittle people who voted Ukip.</b> Instead the Conservatives would instead respond to the rise in the Ukip vote with a strategy of \"listen, respond and deliver\", he said.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The modern Conservative Party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent.</p><p>We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too those who cast their vote for another party.

For an opposition aspiring to win the election next year, Labour had a miserable set of results.</p><p>Not just because their leader does not appeal; not just because their campaign was poorly run; but because what they are offering the British people is a return to more borrowing, more spending, more debt that plunged Britain into economic crisis – and the British people don’t want that; they don’t want to go back to square one.</p></blockquote><p><b>• Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, has said that the Tories should become a party of \"social justice\". </b>This is what he said in a speech opening the ConservativeHome conference.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Redistribution, the minimum wage, [tackling] low pay, supporting trade unionism, affordable housing, none of these things we should be against. In fact, we should be positively working towards, because if we are ever to win a general election with a proper majority, we need to convince working people on low incomes that we are on their side and that we are a party of social justice. None of this means that I'm leftwing. What it does mean is that we are prepared to understand the issues that people on low incomes face in their daily lives.</p></blockquote><p>He said he admired Labour because everyone knew the party had a moral mission. The Tories should be clear that they had one too, he said. It was promoting aspiration. To show that, the party should adopt a ladder as its emblem.</p><p><b>• Michael Dugher, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, has said that \"Farage-mania on the telly every night\" was party responsible for Ukip doing well in the local elections. </b>Speaking on the Today programme, he said that Labour had to \"fight much harder\" to tackle the Ukip threat in traditional northern heartlands. But he said Labour had made \"extremely good progress\" and remained \"on course for a majority\" in the Commons.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In many parts of the country, Labour spoke to that anger and we were the party of change and we did win those elections. In other parts of country we didn't, which means we do have more work to do and that's what we are going to be doing every week for the next 11 months.</p></blockquote><p><b><a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/lutfur-rahman-wins-knifeedge-vote-and-is-reelected-as-mayor-of-tower-hamlets-9430118.html\">• Lutfur Rahman has been relected as independent mayor for Tower Hamlets.</a></b></p><p><b>• The Democratic Unionist party is ahead in Northern Ireland, where the votes from the local elections are still being counted. </b>My colleague Henry McDonald has sent me this.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In Northern Ireland's local elections the Democratic Unionist Party this morning still have their noses out in front in the race to be the biggest political force in the region.

Two thirds of Thursday’s Ukip voters think David Cameron is the best available Prime Minister, compared to a quarter for Ed Miliband. And nearly seven in ten trust Cameron and Osborne more than Miliband and Balls when it comes to running the economy. (Indeed, one in ten Labour voters trust the Tory duo more than their own two Eds).</p><p>Just over half of Ukip Euro voters supported the Tories at the 2010 election. One in seven voted Labour, and a fifth were Lib Dems. As for next May, only half of them expect to stay with Ukip. One fifth already say they will go back to the Tories, one in ten will vote Labour, and 14 per cent say they don’t know what they will do.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53805484e4b0be668b586be7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T10:26:16.553+01:00\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Conservatives are meeting in London today, with one set of election results now finally in, and the European election results coming tomorrow.

Parties can win an election without winning. </b>On paper, Labour clearly won. They have gained more than 250 seats (the BBC figures have been ahead of the ones on our result chart, but that's because our figures only get updated when full council results come in), and they are easily ahead on projected national share. If Britons voted like this in a general election, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. But it hasn't felt like a victory for them. If you want to know who feels as if they've won an election, ignore what politicians say, turn the volume down and look at their faces on TV. Who's happiest? It's definitely Ukip first, then probably the Conservatives, then Labour, then Ukip. That's because, given the likelihood of the gap between Labour and the Conservatives closing between now and 2015, Labour know this isn't good enough to offer a strong chance of victory.</p><p><b>2. Ukip's chances of winning the European elections don't look as good as they did this time yesterday. </b>Their national vote share is down six points compared to last year, and, although there must be some people who voted Ukip in the Euros and for another party in the locals, there must be a chance that the polls saying Ukip would win have got it wrong.</p><p><b>3. Labour now fully realise that Ukip presents them with a serious electoral threat. </b>This shouldn't be a surprise. Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin have written a very good book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/09/nigel-farage-hosts-phone-in-on-lbc-politics-live-blog#block-536c83c6e4b012a5c554bc6a\">(which I keep plugging) </a>making this very case. But it has taken a while for the message to get through.</p><p><b>4. Labour's post-election inquest will probably be more serious than the Conservatives'.</b> Journalists expected these elections to trigger a mini crisis in the Conservative party. But there has been no evidence of that at all. A few Eurosceptics have renewed their call for a pact with Ukip, but this is an absolute non-starter, and they know it. Generally, the Eurosceptics have decided not to cause trouble. But the public comments from Labour figures suggest the party is going to conduct a proper post-mortem, not into Ed Miliband's leadership (they are stuck with him, for better or worse), but into whether their Ukip strategy is correct. And that's because ...</p><p><b>5. None of the parties have a clue what to do about Ukip.</b> Politicians from all the main parties have been saying much the same thing: that voters have sent them a message, and that they must listen. But there is no real agreement what the message is, or what they should do about it.</p><p><b>6. A second hung parliament looks increasingly inevitable.</b> Four-party politics is increasingly entrenched in English politics (as in Scottish and Welsh politics, only they have a different four parties), and that makes it harder for any of them to win outright.</p><p><b>7. The Lib Dems are vulnerable even in their strongholds. </b>Last year they thought they had hit rock bottom in the local elections. They hadn't. Although they are holding on in some Lib Dem areas, in others they are losing seats. The BBC say even Vince Cable would lose his seat on the basis of today's results.</p><p><b>8. London really is a different from the rest of the country electorally.</b> It seems to be the only place in England impervious to Ukip's charms. Like Scotland. (Perhaps if Scotland goes independent we Londoners could join up with them, share the pound, and leave the rest of England with something Ukip-ish, like the groat?)</p><p>That's all from me. Ben Quinn is now taking the controls.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T18:50:46.975+01:00\">at 6.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-537f7e4ee4b0be668b586bc1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T18:01:50.622+01:00\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lib Dems could be on course for a wipeout in Islington, according to the Mirror's James Lyons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MirrorJames/statuses/469880423078965248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Lib Dems heading for wipeout in Islington?

Even last year he was suggesting treaty changes and an intergovernmental conference. His latest foray in a piece for the Sunday Times seemed a little bit less ambitious.</p><p> Our Bloomberg proposition might seem a little more persuasive if we did not water it down. And having one or two officials in Number 10 considering renegotiation who actually believe in the need for substantial change might help, too ...</p><p>If David Cameron is as serious about an In/Out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel Farage is as serious about Brexit as he claims, the two of them need to do a deal. The law already allows joint candidates. We have a list of MPs on both sides of the House who in October 2011 showed that they are serious about securing an EU referendum ...</p><p>The Sunday papers will be thick with column inches from pundits, many of whom will now be overnight experts on why people vote Ukip. “Carry on” many will say. “Let’s just carry on like before”. Those in charge of sales at HMV music probably once felt the same way when they heard that some folk had started to buy music online. Some things we have to carry on. But some things we need to change.</p></blockquote><p>From <b>Jacob Rees-Mogg</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With the promise of the referendum the Conservative Party and Ukip are moving in exactly the same direction that is offering the British people a final decision on whether we have continued membership of the European Union and that surely pushes towards a coupon of some kind.</p></blockquote><p>From <b>Peter Bone</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What we mustn't do [is] have the right-of-centre vote poll more than fifty per cent at the general election and and let Miliband and Co in - that would be a disaster.

And they will become our target seats in 2015 for the general election and I should have thought this particular seat would be quite high on the list.</p></blockquote><p>Ukip have gained almost 100 seats so far - already exceeding one prediction made by election experts - and they seem to have gained almost a quarter of the projected national share of the vote. On TV Ukip figures are the only ones who seem genuinely pleased with their performance. But it is not clear that they will beat the 139 net gains they made in local elections last year, when only 2,363 seats were up for election (this year it's 4,216) and their share of the vote seems to be about the same, even though having local elections coincide with European elections this year should have provided them with a boost. <b>John Curtice</b>, the BBC's psephologist, told the World at One just now: \"It's probably the case that actually the performance is not quite as good as in last year's stupendous performance.\" </p><p><b>• Politicians from the three main parties have all accepted that Ukip's success shows that politicians need to listen more to the concerns of the electorate.</b> But, beyond that, there seems to be little agreement as to what lessons they should be learning.</p><p><b>• Labour has won control of six councils so far, and gained more than 150 seats. </b>But it's also been losing seats to Ukip, and it is not clear that the result would deliver Labour a majority at the general election. Some figures have already started to publicly criticise the quality of the party's campaign. There have been some barbed remarks about Ed Miliband's leadership, but the more important debate seems to be about how the party tackles Ukip. Douglas Alexander has suggested that Ukip's rise could help the party beat the Tories, but some in the party think this approach is complacent. John Curtice said the results \"do not provide Labour with much comfort\". He said Labour's share of the vote (the projected national share, or PNS) was only three or four points up on 2010, which suggests they are on 30% or 31%.</p><p><b>• The Lib Dems have already lost more than 130 seats and, according to the John Curtice, they may be heading for \"their worst set of results yet this parliament\".</b> He told the World at One just now that they were 13 points below their vote in the 2010 local elections, which suggests that they are heading for a projected national share of 13%. </p><p><b>• David Cameron has again ruled out a pact with Ukip following the Conservatives' disappointing performance.</b> They have lost more than 130 seats, and some Eurosceptics have been renewing their call for an electoral pact with Ukip. Cameron said that was unacceptable (although he did not rule out the Tories working with Ukip at local council level). However, the only MPs speaking out are relatively marginal figures, and no one is publicly attacking Cameron's leadership. John Curtice said they were three points below their performance in 2012, suggesting they are on course for a PNS of  28%.</p><p><b>• The Greens are on course for getting 10% of the vote, according to Curtice. </b></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537f3650e4b020b0f5edac8f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T12:56:41.876+01:00\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Nigel Farage</b> has been visiting Thurrock, where Ukip gained five seats. </p><p>But he ruled out standing as a candidate in Essex himself at the general election.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>No, that's not for me to do.

Since then, however, the grip has loosened  a little, with one member becoming independent after falling out with the party over plans to build on green spaces and the Tories pinching a seat in a by-election. </p><p>This time round, half the seats are up for grabs with the Lib Dems defending 12 of them. And the Ukip factor will play a bigger part than ever before. Nigel Farage's party won three Gloucestershire county council seats last year and is fielding 11 candidates in these local elections – more than Labour. </p><p>But the Lib Dems in regency Cheltenham are experienced, clever campaigners. They have worked very hard here not just to make sure they hang on to control of the council but so they will be battle-ready for next year's general election when it will probably be a straight fight between the Lib Dems and the Tories. </p><p>From a standing start it looks as if Ukip has done well. They may not win any seats but they reckon they are creating a solid base from which they will build. </p><p>Christina Simmonds, the Ukip branch chairman, said the party had focused on local issues – complaints over changes to the road system in the centre of town, car parking, leisure facilities. But she said the party's core messages on Europe and immigration were chiming with voters. </p><p>“I think people are also realising that we are not the idiots the other parties and the media want to make us out to be,” she said. “They patronise us and try to make out we don't know what we're talking out just because they don't agree with us.

As I write the BBC suggest they are getting about 25% of the vote in wards they contest (though much worse in London) and have gained about 100 councillors. Two things to put this in context though – the first is that this is roughly the same level of support as they got at the local elections last year. I don’t really know if that’s good or bad for them. At one level they’ve sustained last year’s advance, it’s not a flash in the pan and they are more firmly establishing themselves as a major force. On the other hand, these are local elections <i>on the same day as the European election</i>… shouldn’t they be improving on last year? Second caveat, their vote is still very evenly spread. They are getting many more votes than the Lib Dems, but far fewer councillors. As was the case last year, UKIP are doing fantastically well at coming second in many places and that doesn’t build the council base they need to build support in target seats for the general election.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/ukip-success-local-elections-two-party-system-crisis\">• John Harris at Comment is free says we should stop sneering at Ukip.</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\">local election results come in and Ukip's numbers continue to look remarkable</a>, the rest of us should maybe pause for thought and realise that something rather sobering is afoot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/04/ukip-farage-local-election-results\">as happened in the 2012 county council elections</a>, only more so.

Moreover, if people are supporting Ukip in such large numbers – even after the media's massed guns have been rattling at it for weeks – it is probably time to drop all the sneering and think about why.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jameskirkup/100272837/local-elections-six-things-you-need-to-know-about-ukip-labour-and-the-tories/\">• James Kirkup at the Telegraph lists six lessons from the elections.</a><br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/05/local-elections\">• Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says David Cameron will be \"quietly pleased\" with the result.</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Labour did well to take Cambridge, Croydon, Redbridge and, in particular, Hammersmith and Fulham (where the socio-economic and demographic tide has been working against the party over past years). Still, it is hard to avoid the impression that the party’s success was limited to metropolitan pockets, while it did much worse in more blue-collar areas. Its loss of control in Thurrock, a typical example of these, will particularly smart as the seat holds second place on the party’s ranking of its 106 general election targets.</p><p>The best that can be said about the Lib Dems’ dismal performance is that it was largely expected. At the time of writing the party had lost 64 seats. More damaging to the party’s morale, however, will be its results in leafy areas like Cambridge (where it was previously the largest party), Kingston and across south-west London in general. Lib Dems are resigned to losing parliamentary seats in less prosperous parts of the country, where the spending cuts of the past years have hit hardest, but had hoped to hold the line in wealthier places where their coalition with the Conservatives is less controversial.

Here are the key points.</p><p><b>• Curtice said that Labour were doing worse than they were two years ago.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>When it comes to local elections, we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve because we basically say, if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections, even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time. The truth is, by that test at least, Labour have not done well enough.</p><p>Most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election. And if you compare Labour's performance vote for vote with 2010, the advance is just 3% point - 3% on what was the day in which Labour recorded its second worst result. And if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago, which we can also compare most of these places with, Labour's vote is clearly well down, something like nine points.</p><p>So the truth is, modest progress, Labour not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament, and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the British electorate regard Labour as a clear alternative.</p></blockquote><p><b>• He said Ukip were doing much better than expected.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Certainly what these local elections demonstrate is that anybody who thought that the Ukip bubble was going to be easily deflated should now be disabused of that notion. They have managed to maintain most of the support they have had over the last 12 months and repeated it at these local elections. To that extent at least they have done remarkably well.</p><p>We have already found Ukip gaining over 80 seats. That was as much as anybody expected them to make [see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live#block-537ed4cde4b0e732c16db8a8\">6.01am],</a> even if they did well, and we've only had a third or so of the results actually in yet.

The Conservatives and the Lib Dems were saying earlier this week that they expected to lose seats, and Labour claimed they were only expecting to gain around 150 seats. But polling experts do produce more objective figures, based on how well the parties are doing in the polls, and I'm aware of two different “forecasts”.</p><h2>Rallings/Thrasher</h2><p>Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher are professors of politics at University of Plymouth who specialise in studying local elections.<a href=\"https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/PSA%202014%20Local%20Elections%20Media%20Briefings%20-%20Slides%2029-04-14jl.pdf\"> In a briefing for the Political Studies Association last month</a>, they produced some figures for the number of seats they expect the main parties to win in these local elections based on how well they have been performing over the last three months in local council byelections.<br></p><p>According to Rawlings and Thrasher, those byelections suggest produce following national equivalent vote (NEV). NEV is what the national vote share would be if the results in places that did vote were replicated in wards all over the country.</p><p>Labour: 33%<br></p><p>Conservatives: 30%<br></p><p>Ukip: 16%<br></p><p>Lib Dems: 14%<br></p><p>According to Rallings and Thrasher, a strict application of this NEV would see Labour gain 500 seats, the Lib Dems lose 340, and the Conservatives lose 160. And Ukip would not win a single seat. But they recognise that it is hard to assess Ukip, because they are a relatively new party that has only started winning council seats, and so they revised their figures to take into account the likelihood they would win some seats.

The Conservatives have lost control of several councils as a result of the Ukip advance. And the Ukip surge has also hit Labour, which has been picking up seats, but perhaps fewer than expected, and which has lost control of Thurrock following Ukip gains there. The Lib Dems are doing particularly badly.</p><p>Here are some of the results in detail. I've taken the information from the Press Association.</p><p>• Ukip have gained 11 seats in Basildon, Essex, meaning the Conservatives lost control of the council.<br></p><p>• Ukip gained five seats in Thurrock, Essex, meaning that Labour lost control of the council.</p><p>• The Conservatives lost control in Southend-on-Sea after a Ukip surge saw them gain five seats.</p><p>• The Tories lost control of Tamworth in Staffordshire, where no party now has overall control.</p><p>• The Lib Dems have lost control of Portsmouth.</p><p>• Ukip won four seats in Maidstone in Kent, costing the Conservatives control of the council.</p><p>• Labour has claimed it has seized control of \"David Cameron's favourite council\" - Tory-run Hammersmith and Fulham.</p><p>• The Conservatives lost four seats in Peterborough, which meant they lost overall control of the council.</p><p>• The Conservatives have lost control of Brentwood in Essex.</p><p>•  The Conservatives have lost control of Castle Point, which covers Canvey Island in Essex, following Ukip gains.</p><p>• Mike Hancock, the MP elected as a Lib Dem who now sits as an independent, has lost his council seat in Portsmouth.</p> </div>

But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-election-ukip-nigel-farage-labour-tories-lib-dems\" title=\"\">results of Thursday's elections</a> make you wonder: is London another country too?</p><p>Even to ask the question prompts embarrassment. It plays to the very case Ukip has long been making, that the media is part of an out-of-touch metropolitan elite concerned chiefly with itself. But the figures speak for themselves. The UK Independence party surged across England, grabbing 23% of the vote – a figure that may well rise with Sunday's European results. Only in one part of England did Ukip tank, shrugged off like a no-hoper fringe party  rather than the coming force in British politics. And that place was London.</p><p>In the capital Ukip scarcely reached double figures. That was never going to be the lead headline on a night that brought delight to Nigel Farage, muted disappointment to Ed Miliband, relative relief to David Cameron, and further kicks to the groin of Nick Clegg. But that London difference is significant all the same – for what it says not only about the political landscape, where it poses a dilemma for both Tories and Labour, but about the changing face of these islands.</p><p>Asked to explain the party's failure in London, Ukip's Suzanne Evans was asked if she agreed with the Kipper who had said the problem was that the capital was too full of the \"cultured, educated and young\". She did not dismiss that view, conceding that, yes, there was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite\" title=\"\">\"more media-savvy, well-educated population in London\"</a> who were more likely to have swallowed press lies about the Faragistes.</p><p>Put aside the fact that if they're so media-savvy, Londoners should have been less, not more, susceptible to a conspiracy of disinformation. It was an arresting admission, but it was incomplete. For the stats say that Ukip voters are indeed less likely to be graduates than others, but they are also older and whiter. Londoners are, by contrast, more likely to be graduates, younger and less white.</p><p>No wonder Ukip couldn't succeed in the capital. London is the place that Ukip warns about, the realisation of its worst nightmares. As the 2011 census revealed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/21/flight-minorities-london-suburbs-white-flight\" title=\"\">white Britons are now a minority in London</a>, accounting for only 45% of the city's population. More than 40% of Londoners were born overseas. Christians form the largest religious group, but they are no longer a majority. The highest proportion of Muslims (and every other religion) in Britain is to be found in London, where (often African) churches, mosques, temples and synagogues thrive.</p><p>It's not just that the capital is uncongenial for someone who, like Farage, feels uncomfortable hearing languages other than English. It also undermines Ukip's entire argument about immigration and modernity. For if Ukip's core message is that Britons cannot take too much diversity, London stands as a rebuttal. It is the most mixed, diverse place in Britain – but it is also the place apparently least troubled by that variety, a sentiment eloquently expressed in its collective rejection of Ukip.</p><p>What to make of this difference? For some Londoners, it's grounds for smug superiority, as if the capital and its citizens have reached a higher level of sophistication than the neanderthals in the rest of the country. Such thinking might work on Twitter, but it's a political dead end. For the London difference poses the three main political parties a serious problem. If the capital and its attitudes are at such variance with the rest of the country, then the three established political parties are literally in the wrong place. Headquartered in London, they cannot help but be identified with a metropolitan class out of step with everyone else.</p><p>Some in Labour see opportunity here. Town hall gains in the London suburbs of Merton, Redbridge and Croydon suggest that, as an area becomes home to younger voters and more people of colour, the Labour vote rises. For the party's optimists, that's a trend that can only get bigger. For surely the entire country, not just London, is heading in that direction. Look at that 2011 census again, which showed a five-point fall in the proportion of white people in Britain since 2001, or at this month's Policy Exchange report – which estimated that between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/06/ethnic-minority-voters-identity-politics\" title=\"\">20% and 30% of Britons will be black or minority ethnic</a> (BME) by mid-century.</p><p>If the pattern shown this week is repeated, cheerful Labour folk conclude, then the party's base is set to expand in coming decades. They cite the changing US electorate, which has left Republicans relying on an ever-shrinking white vote while Democrats are boosted by expanding minority communities as well as younger, educated Americans who like, rather than lament, their country's changing face. Were that dynamic to be repeated here, and Birmingham or Manchester go the way of London, then the future is Labour's.</p><p>That leaves the Conservatives with a serious strategic dilemma. To woo the urban – and now suburban – vote from Labour, they would have to modernise further. Equal marriage would have to be more than a one-off: it would have to be typical Tory policy. Yet Conservatives are itching to go in the opposite direction, to chase those voters they're losing to Ukip by promising ever redder meat on welfare and immigration. The party needs to head left and right at the same time – a feat that is near impossible.</p><p></p><p>The sharpness of this dilemma helps one Tory, though. Boris Johnson's 2012 win in London looks like an even greater achievement now than it did then. He managed to assemble a winning majority from both diverse, right-on London and its more homogeneous, whiter outer boroughs. His maverick persona – however confected it might be – seems to appeal to Ukip types. Expect several rattled Tories to insist that if these elections have posed a question, Boris is the answer.</p><p>But the conundrum presses in on Labour too. Glad though it will be to have the votes of what the LSE's London guru <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tonytravers\" title=\"\">Tony Travers</a> calls \"Shoreditch hipsters\" and BME suburbanites, they're not plentiful enough to win a general election. Travers notes that Ukip's base – older, whiter and non-graduate – used to be Labour's core vote. In Rotherham and elsewhere, Ukip made serious inroads. Labour needs to win back that traditional base; yet the more it appeals to its new metropolitan backers, the more it risks alienating the old-time heartlands.</p><p>So Ukip has driven a wedge into both established parties, dividing their coalitions down the middle. As London drifts apart from the rest of the country, as Scotland considers breaking away, and as Labour and Tories alike find themselves torn in two, Britain stands as a country pulled in radically different directions – wondering when we will <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\" title=\"\">follow the poet and conclude that the centre cannot hold</a>.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@freedland</em></a><em> </em></p>","headline":"London is Ukip's worst nightmare","trailText":"<strong>Jonathan Freedland:</strong> The local election results highlight how out-of-step London attitudes pose a serious dilemma for Labour and Tories","newspaperPageNumber":"41","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400873098924/Shoreditch-bohemians-006.jpg","wordcount":"1133","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437675042","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9081042","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Freedland","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2098291","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T19:44:26Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/london-ukip-nightmare-labout-tories-local-elections-farage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/london-ukip-nightmare-labout-tories-local-elections-farage","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanfreedland","webTitle":"Jonathan Freedland","rcsId":"GNL042070","r2ContributorId":"15904","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749333991/JonathanFreedland.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733740842/JonathanFreedland.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Freedland is the Guardian's executive editor, Opinion, overseeing Comment is free, editorials and a forthcoming section devoted to long-form journalism.

The canary may even be asphyxiated in the coal mine. Whatever the chosen metaphor, four-party politics has arrived in Britain, and the only question is whether it will ever go away.</p><p>Labour can fairly claim that as Friday dragged on, it did better than the first local election results had indicated on Thursday night. But Farage can also reasonably say that Ukip now has an imprint in local government under a first-past-the-post system. And the Ukip leader is promising that the imprint will deepen, and provide the basis to win constituency seats in a general election.</p><p>Thursday's elections, concentrated in Labour areas, have also confirmed, if confirmation was needed, that Ukip can damage Labour as much as it can the Conservatives, meaning both main parties need to throw out the old methods to project swings and to forecast the marginal seats they can gain.</p><p>In Rotherham, a Labour heartland, Ukip came first in 10 and second in 11 of the 21 seats it fought. But in such cases the Ukip insurgency does not yet look powerful enough to threaten Labour seats in 2015.</p><p>More worryingly, in some target seats in the north-west and the West Midlands, a strong Ukip performance has meant Labour has not made the gains for which it had hoped, for instance in Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall. \"Worcester man\" has also not gone&nbsp;Labour.</p><p>But that is not the whole picture. The most obvious exception seems to be London. The capital has its own house prices, a multicultural population and now, almost, its own political cycle.</p><p>The city that spawned the recession seems to be the part of the country least hit by its consequences, and most willing to back Labour. Even in Barking, Labour held every seat. There were many gains, too: an impressive achievement that reflects the strength of the activist base in the capital where its \"get out the vote\" operation had some successes. In Hornsey and Wood Green, the party is 1,500 strong.</p><p>One Labour strategist, speaking as the second wave of results emerged, said: \"I would rather be where we are this morning than where [Conservative party campaign consultant] Lynton Crosby is. There is a massive wave sweeping over politics called four-party politics. But there is also a strong current to Labour. We think we will make over 250 gains.\"</p><p>Labour with growing credibility insisted it was winning in the marginals where it mattered and pointed to victories outside London, in Cambridge, Lincoln, Amber Valley, Ipswich, Peterborough and Carlisle.</p><p>But there is also an acknowledgement that it did not do as well as it hoped, with disappointment in Trafford.</p><p>By the time of the general election next year, senior Labour strategists accept the Ukip vote will not shrink back to the 3% it polled in the 2010 general election, but still believe the bulk of the Ukip damage then will be inflicted on the Conservatives.</p><p>Still, there will be an inquest into the Labour campaign, and why it has been as much the victim of the anti-politics mood as the governing parties.</p><p>Some Labour MPs, such as John Spellar, John Healey, Peter Hain and John Mann, have long been arguing for the party to go on the front foot against Ukip, exposing them as modern-day Thatcherites bent on flat taxes and NHS privatisation. It has been said that Douglas Alexander, the party's chief election strategist, rejected pleas, including from his MEPs,  to put an attack on Ukip centre-stage.</p><p>But he did sanction market-tested literature attacking Ukip, and has a clear analysis of what is driving Ukip support. He has argued that Ukip is not fuelled by dislike of Europe, but by a hatred of the political class. In some alienated communities, there is a sense that people have been ignored by Westminster, and simply cannot see their place in the future. Alexander has argued this predates George Osborne's 2010 budget, and even the financial crash in 2007.</p><p>Coming from Scotland, Alexander is unlikely to underestimate the importance of four-party politics.</p><p>Miliband also insists he understands the discontent that led people to vote Ukip, and his choice is to patiently offer practical policies to address the anger with politics. It is the approach Barack Obama took with the Tea Party in the US. It means no name-calling, but instead addressing the causes of the discontent.</p><p>Many MPs close to their working class communities bluntly disagree with this analysis and think it is time to do more to call Ukip out, rather than spending time attacking the self-immolating Liberal Democrats. They argue that Miliband put out a lot of policy in this campaign designed to appeal to potential Ukip supporters, but it was drowned out by immigration, welfare and Farage.</p><p>But the doorstep issue of Miliband himself does exist. Parts of the campaign malfunctioned: if you are planning to take Swindon council, you need to know the name of the Labour leader on said council; if you are campaigning on the cost of living, you need to know the cost of living. Miliband struggled to credibly estimate his weekly shopping bill, reckoning it at very modest£70 to £80 a week.</p><p>But Labour says the campaign was deliberately intensive and a dry run for the 2015 general election. Better to mess up now and fine tune, rather than mess up in 2015, they argue.</p><p>Labour insists Ukip supporters are more likely to be won over by the Miliband message in the next year, than by David Cameron's claims that the economy has recovered. It means the test for the Alexander team now is how far they can deflate the Ukip bubble. It hopes these Labour sympathisers will recoil at the thought of a second term for Cameron, and Ukip's appeal to older, white, working-class men will wane.</p><p>Cameron, by contrast, thinks he has two decisive weapons – a rapidly improving economy, and Miliband. The next year will reveal the truth.</p>","headline":"This is now four-party politics, and Labour paid its share of the tab","trailText":"Ukip is as much of a problem for Miliband as for the Tories,

estimate Ukip has polled just 7% in the capital, compared with more than 20% in the rest of the country","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-08-04T17:30:58Z","body":"<p>A deep geographical split has emerged in Ukip's popularity, after the party built new strongholds in coastal and market towns in local elections but failed to win more than a handful of seats in London.</p><p>Experts estimated that Ukip was polling more than 20% in most of the country, helping to unseat at least five Conservative, three Labour and one Liberal Democrat local authorities. But its polling was at 7% in London, where Labour gains were dominant and turned four of the outer suburbs red.</p><p>Nigel Farage declared he had unleashed a \"Ukip fox in the Westminster henhouse\" and continued to predict a victory in the European elections, the results of which are due on Sunday. However, the party's poor showing in the capital may have helped push the party's overall share of the vote below 17%, significantly lower than its 23% share in local elections last year and well below both Labour and the Conservatives.</p><p>One prominent Ukip candidate, Suzanne Evans, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite\" title=\"\">attributed Ukip's failure to gain ground in London to its \"more media-savvy and educated\" population</a>, in contrast to the rest of the country.</p><p>The former Tory Merton councillor who defected to Ukip but lost her seat, told the BBC: \"[In London, voters] are more likely, I think, to have read some of the negative press that's been about us, and I think they'd be more likely to believe it, whereas people outside of London have, I think, been fairly cynical about the media campaign and the campaign that the other parties have waged against us.\"</p><p>She suggested the \"educated, cultured and young\" in the capital were less likely to vote for Ukip and claimed the party was unlike the \"metropolitan elite\" in being able to understand the \"heartache\" felt by the rest of the country.</p><p>Professor John Curtice, a psephologist at Strathclyde University, said the results showed the share of the vote going to Farage's party had dropped since last year, but \"anybody who thought that the Ukip bubble was going to be easily deflated should now be disabused of that notion\".</p><p>\"They have managed to maintain most of the support they have had over the last 12 months and repeated it at these local elections. To that extent at least they have done remarkably well,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>In London, Ukip did not pick up a single councillor in Redbridge, Merton, Richmond, Sutton, Enfield, Haringey or Wandsworth, with only a couple of seats in Bexley. However, its decision to field candidates across London boroughs may have helped Labour to victory by splitting the rightwing vote in places such as Croydon, which Miliband's party took off the Conservatives.</p><p>Mike Fisher, Croydon borough's ousted Tory leader of eight years blamed Ukip for the loss. Although Labour increased its vote in key wards and delivered turnouts of close to 50% in some cases, Ukip consistently came second and third in many wards.</p><p>\"When we were canvassing nobody was saying they were for Ukip because it's still a guilty secret,\" Fisher said. \"But the level of support has come out today. Voters are using this as an opportunity to rebel and I hope that when it comes to the general election people will look at the policies of the main parties. The annoying thing here is that Ukip have lots of votes but no seats. Many of those Ukip voters are Conservatives and they will be horrified to wake up this morning to a Labour council.\"</p><p>In the rest of the country, a stronger picture emerged for Farage's party with 28 new Ukip councillors helping to topple the Tories in Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Maidstone, Peterborough and Castle Point. Malcolm Buckley, the former leader of Basildon council who was ousted by Ukip, criticised David Cameron for \"not getting it\" on the issues of immigration and the European Union.</p><p>Ukip's gain of six new councillors in Portsmouth meant the Liberal Democrats lost control of the authority, ejecting their longstanding councillor and MP Mike Hancock who was suspended by the party in January following a leaked report into claims of sexual misconduct, which he denies, towards a female constituent. However, Farage's party failed to replicate this success in nearby Eastleigh, where it nearly won a byelection in 2010. Instead, the Lib Dems increased their dominance by one seat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Labour lost its majorities in Great Yarmouth, because of 10 new Ukip councillors; Thurrock, due to five new Ukip councillors; and North East Lincolnshire, because of another five Ukip gains. However, two of these areas have Conservative MPs with very small majorities – Brandon Lewis in Great Yarmouth and Jackie Doyle-Price in Thurrock – suggesting the rise of Ukip in these areas actually poses just as much of a threat to the Conservatives at the general election. In Lincolnshire's Great Grimbsy, the Labour seat of retiring MP Austin Mitchell, Curtice predicted there could be a Ukip win at the general election.</p><p>Labour held on in Rotherham by a large majority, but Ukip became the official opposition after winning seven seats from Labour, two from the Conservatives, and holding the one seat it won in a byelection last year.

It also has the support of a number of younger party activists, but it is not clear if it will sway the minds of instinctively loyal Lib Dem MPs.</p><p>The Lib Dems lost nearly 300 council seats and took a terrible pasting in London, Manchester and Liverpool.</p><p>Overall the BBC had the Lib Dem share of the vote at 13%. Some of the projections based on the local elections suggest a slew of Lib Dem MPs would lose their seats, including the business secretary, Vince Cable, Cambridge MP Julian Huppert and the justice minister, Simon Hughes.</p><p>The fate of the party in its Scottish and Welsh seats will only be clear when the European election results are announced on Sunday.</p><p>Clegg's aides say the local election results represent a tale of two elections: one in which the party did relatively well against the Conservatives, such as in Eastleigh, and one in which it did very badly when competing against Labour, especially in London.</p><p>They say a second hung parliament still looks the most likely result in 2015.</p><p>The petition states: \"The devastating results on Friday have made it clear that even the best Liberal Democrat candidates, councillors and councils have come up against a brick wall. It is simply impossible for the party to make any headway so long as it is led by Nick Clegg.</p><p>\"There is a serious trust deficit – rightly or wrongly. Nothing Clegg says can be taken seriously by the electorate. Even when he was articulately expounding the case for Europe against Nigel Farage no one believed him.\"</p><p>Last week's ComRes poll gave Clegg an approval rating of 56% – exactly the same score as the very worst rating of Michael Foot when he was the leader of Labour, who was himself the least popular party leader since polling began.</p><p>\"Clegg has alienated almost two-thirds of the party's former voters, many of them drawn from its core support,\" the petition continues.</p><p>\"These elections represent our last chance to take stock and make the right decision in renewing the party to present a robust platform in 2015.\"</p><p>The petition will at least serve the purpose of resolving his leadership. A loss of 20 seats, which would cut the number of Lib Dem MPs by more than a third from the 57 elected in 2010, would be a blow to Clegg's authority. It would take the party well below the 46 seats won at the 1997 general election – the year of Paddy Ashdown's breakthrough.</p><p>Both Cable and the party president, Tim Farron, the two most likely candidates to replace Clegg, went out of their way to express their loyalty to him.</p><p>The local election results suggest that in Sheffield Hallam, Clegg's constituency, the party leader would have been re-elected, taking 53% of the vote, up 3.7%, with Labour on 32% and the Conservatives on 14.7%. But t The Lib Dems also said they won Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Eastleigh – scene of a Lib Dem byelection win in February last year when Mike Thornton held the seat, stabilising Clegg's leadership.</p><p>But the projections show the party will face a battle to hold on to vulnerable seats such as Hornsey and Wood Green in north London, Solihull in the West Midlands, Burnley, Bradford and East Manchester Withington.</p>","headline":"Lib Dem local election results suggest party could lose 20 parliamentary seats","trailText":"Party on course to lose third of MPs, but could hold

Based on voting in English councils, the BBC estimated that Labour would get 322 seats, the Conservatives 255, Liberal Democrats 45 and other parties including Ukip 28. Sky News calculations also project a House of Commons with Labour on 322 seats, which is 64 up on 2010 and just four short of the 326 required for a working majority.</p><p>It estimated that the Tories would drop back 45 to 261, very close to Labour's 258 last time, suggesting that a general election today would produce a near mirror image of what took place four years ago. However, Sky predicted a bigger difference for the Lib Dems, which would shed 20 MPs to just 37.</p><p>Projecting general election results from local election polls is fraught; turnout would probably be double the local showing of 36%. Within that, mostly urban and English parts of Britain had a council vote this time around.</p><p>The European ballot boxes, which will be opened on Sunday night, are a sounder basis for projection as the whole of Britain had MEPs to elect. However, the remote Euro-parliament has always been prone to protest voting, which disappears in the real contest. People vote differently in local, European and general elections.</p><p>A Guardian analysis of local voting in the most marginal Westminster constituencies shows a mixed picture for Labour; the party has taken some wards in its 106 crucial battleground areas, but failed to gain ground or retreated in others.</p><p>However, Labour aides claimed the party finished top in 29 of its general election target seats. One of its  biggest coups was taking Amber Valley from the Conservatives, where Tory MP Nigel Mills has the 27th-slimmest majority in Labour's 11th most important target seat. Labour also won  Redbridge, the borough containing Tory MP Lee Scott's Ilford North seat, which is 83 on Ed Miliband's list.</p><p>Labour won two extra wards in Bury, where Tory David Nuttall is defending Bury North – 40th on the target list. The party also got five extra councillors in Enfield, where the north of the town is defended by another Conservative, Nick De Bois, and the 29th Labour target. The party also gained two wards to take Crawley from the Conservatives.</p><p>However, it failed to take several councils with no overall control that contain desirable Tory constituencies, including Simon Reevell's Dewsbury, which is 21 on the list, Stroud held by Neil Carmichael, which is 16th on the list, Gloucester defended by Richard Graham, at 38 on the list, and Swindon held by Robert Buckland and Justin Tomlinson at 55 and 102 on the list. Labour also lost control of Thurrock, its second best hope of a gain from Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price, and Great Yarmouth, the seat of Tory Brandon Lewis, which is 73 on the list.</p><p>Some of Labour's most impressive gains were in Lib Dem areas, suggesting it is in a good position to take Sarah Teather's seat in Brent Central, Simon Hughes's in Bermondsey, Lynne Featherstone's in Haringey and Julian Huppert's in Cambridge.</p><p>But the most striking feature of the forecast concerns the minor parties. These would get some 30 seats, only one more than last time, despite Ukip appealing to a slice of the electorate.</p><p>Psephologist Rob Ford, of Manchester University, said: \"People vote differently in local and national elections, so you have to be careful. But we can get some sense of the relative standing of the parties based on real votes.\"</p>","headline":"Labour likely to fall just short of Commons majority in 2015, experts say","trailText":"Projections suggest general election could produce a near mirror image of 2010, with Tories dropping back 45 seats and Labour up 64","newspaperPageNumber":"11","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400871782508/Ed-Miliband-greeted-by-su-006.jpg","wordcount":"605","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437674260","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9082835","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason and Tom Clark","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2098287","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T19:04:15Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labur-likely-short-commons-majority-general-election","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/labur-likely-short-commons-majority-general-election","tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rowena-mason","webTitle":"Rowena Mason","r2ContributorId":"58040","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowena-mason","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tomclark","webTitle":"Tom Clark","r2ContributorId":"19161","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/16/1308240664690/tom_clark_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Clark is a leader writer for the Guardian.

Mann says Labour leader failed to attack Nigel Farage in misguided belief that Ukip's rise would only harm Tories","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T01:51:07Z","body":"<p>Ed Miliband ran a \"tremendously ill-judged campaign\" in which he failed to attack Nigel Farage on the mistaken grounds that Ukip would only damage the Conservative party, the Labour backbencher John Mann has said.</p><p>In a sign of rumblings in the Labour party over its mixed performance in the local elections, the MP for Bassetlaw condemned what he called the \"so-called strategists\" for failing to exploit Farage's admiration for Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>Mann told the Guardian: \"It was a tremendously ill-judged campaign, in particular the deliberate decision made not to attack Ukip. Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron. Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world.\"</p><p>The backbencher spoke out as the leaders of Britain's three main political parties woke up to the uncomfortable fact that England had caught up with the devolved nations and now had four main parties.</p><p>By lunchtime Ukip had made nearly 100 gains and deprived Labour of control of Thurrock council in the marginal parliamentary seat the party hopes to recapture from the Tories in next year's general election. The party won around 25% of the vote in wards it contested.</p><p>Farage declared that Ukip had entered the \"Westminster hen house\" and was on course to win seats in parliament at next year's general election. His party performed strongly across England in the local elections.</p><p>Labour received major setbacks in its northern heartlands, where Ukip appeared to eat into its support, prompting the former minister Graham Stringer to warn that Miliband lacked \"immediate appeal\". By lunchtime, with counting continuing, Labour had gained 153 seats – well short of the 490 gains expected by the psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher.</p><p>But Labour pulled off coups by winning David Cameron's favourite London council, Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as Redbridge, Merton and Cambridge.</p><p>The Conservatives are set to lose control of at least eight councils. But they captured Kingston-upon-Thames from the Lib Dems.</p><p>David Cameron said he understood the message from the voters, who he said wanted the government to work harder on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. \"We will be working flat-out to demonstrate that we do have the answers for hard-working people,\" he said.</p><p>The prime minister rejected calls from Eurosceptic Tories to form a pact with Ukip before next year's general election. He told Sky News: \"We are the Conservative party. We don't do pacts and deals. We are fighting all-out for an all-out win at the next election.\"</p><p>The strongest internal party rumblings were in the Labour party as veteran figures raised questions about the leadership's campaign for the European and local elections. A debate that had been taking place behind closed doors burst into the open when Mann said the leadership should have done more to attack Ukip.</p><p>He told the Guardian: \"We should be attacking Ukip over their policies on the economy, on taxation, on their policies on the NHS and, in particular in the north of England, we should have billboards at this election with Nigel Farage with his Margaret Thatcher mug. It was not an accidental strategy, it was a deliberate strategy and the strategists have got a hell of a lot of explaining to do. They called this wrong.\"</p><p>The leadership insisted Miliband had attacked Ukip and had highlighted Farage's admiration for Thatcher. But the leadership took a deliberate decision to follow Barack Obama's approach to the insurgent Tea Party in the US.</p><p>A source said: \"You do not deal with an anti-politics party by calling them names. What you should do is call them out.\"</p><p>But Mann said he and other critics felt excluded from decision making. He said: \"There is a section of the Labour party whose views are not being listened to and the broad coalition that forms the Labour party is too narrow. Those of us who are oiks are not invited to contribute and are not listened to. If we continue to be sidelined then Labour can't win the election – our appeal is too narrow.</p><p>Farage travelled to the swing seat of Thurrock in Essex where Ukip deprived Labour of control of the council. \"The Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house,\" the Ukip leader said. \"There are areas of the country where now we have got an imprint in local government. Under the first-past-the-post system we are serious players.\"</p><p>But Farage admitted Ukip had struggled to make an impression in London. \"London is a younger demographic but the real reason we are not as strong in London as we are just on the other side of the M25 is political parties rely very heavily on voluntary structure and our voluntary structure is 12 to 18 months behind the rest of the country. There is absolutely no reason why, in many parts of London, we can't do better next year than we have done this year.\"</p>","headline":"Local elections: Miliband attacked by Labour MP for letting

But outside the capital, it struggled to make expected gains in key targets such as Swindon, Walsall, Tamworth and Portsmouth, while losing Thurrock to no overall control because of Ukip votes.</p><p>Farage also ate into Conservative strongholds, causing the party to lose control of eight councils, including Maidstone, Southend-on-Sea, Castle Point, Basildon and Brentwood – the constituency of the local government secretary, Eric Pickles.</p><p>By 7am on Friday, with more than 100 of the 172 councils up for election in England and Northern Ireland still to declare, the Tories had lost 102 seats, Labour had gained 94, the Lib Dems had lost 83, Ukip had gained 86, the Greens had gained one and other parties were up seven.</p><p>The results of the European parliament elections, which also took place on Thursday, will be announced on Sunday, but the swell in votes for Ukip indicated that it was likely to have been a closely run contest with Labour for first place.</p><p>The biggest collapse in the share of the vote for the local elections appeared to be for the Liberal Democrats. The party lost Portsmouth council and looked set to lose Kingston to no overall control.</p><p>Ukip did not appear to have broken through in London, where it was polling in single digits, but the party took more than a third of the vote across some wards in Essex and big cities including Birmingham and Hull, where it previously had little or no presence. In Rotherham, Ukip is the official opposition after winning 10 seats and ousting several prominent Labour councillors including the deputy leader of the council.</p><p>Farage said it was a \"very good night\" as the party was now making an \"imprint\" in local government. He said the Ukip \"fox\" was now in the \"Westminster hen house\".</p><h2>Wakeup call for Labour </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609938'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400767026532/23e5f605-b4c9-467a-922f-024d95d2427a-460x276.jpeg' alt='Ed Miliband in Bloxwich' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ed Miliband campaigning in Bloxwich leisure centre, Walsall. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The early results indicated that the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, would face intense criticism during the next 48 hours, including over his personal performance and his appeal to working-class voters. Questions within the party are likely to focus on whether his campaign strategists realised early enough that Ukip posed a threat to Labour as much as to the Conservatives.</p><p>Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and Labour election co-ordinator, said there were \"grounds for optimism\" in key target seats and that the party was well-placed to win the general election next May.</p><p>But the night was described as a wake-up call for the main political parties by John Healey, Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne.</p><p>\"People are angry. They are saying they aren't hearing enough of what they feel in what we politicians are saying,\" he said. \"For me today was compounded when I was out knocking on doors and one man, a lifelong Labour voter, said to me: 'John, I'm voting for Ukip today. You all need a kicking.'\"</p><p>In Labour target seats further south and east, such as Portsmouth, a strong Ukip vote was destroying the party's hopes of making more than 400 council gains.</p><p>The leader of the Labour group in Portsmouth, John Ferrett, said Ukip's performance was \"causing mayhem\". Labour also suffered a blow in a key election battleground after the Conservatives held on to Swindon, days after Miliband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/20/ed-miliband-suffers-bad-day-on-campaign-trail\" title=\"\">embarrassingly failed to recognise the name of the party's group leader in the borough</a>.</p><p>But the man in question, Jim Grant, said Miliband's gaffe had not had an impact on Labour's disappointing showing in the Wiltshire town.</p><p>\"That's a big media event. I don't think it has affected what has happened here. I'm a big fan of Ed but we have all got to work harder to get our message across.\"</p><p>Labour had hoped that the council would at least slip into no overall control. In fact, the Tories ended up with 30 seats to Labour's 23 and the Lib Dems' four.</p><p>Both the Conservatives and Labour will have to think deeply about whether they can win back the Ukip vote, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/tories-ukip-pact-david-cameron-local-elections\" title=\"\">some rightwing Tory backbenchers urging Cameron to think how they can reunite the centre-right through some form of Ukip-Tory pact</a>.</p><p>The Labour MP Graham Stringer, a longstanding critic of party leaders, issued a savage attack on the quality of the Labour campaign, saying it was \"unforgivably unprofessional\", and asked why his aides had been unable to tell Miliband the price of bread.</p><h2>Liberal Democrat wipeout </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609939'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400772163317/73c50ab0-c8f0-4c2e-8cb8-940489a1314f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Clegg votes in Sheffield' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nick Clegg on his way to vote in the elections in Sheffield. Photograph: John Giles/PA</figcaption></figure><p>The Lib Dems were also braced for a poor performance, in a sign of how the burden of pain is being shared across Westminster. The business secretary, Vince Cable, admitted it was going to be a difficult night for the junior party in the coalition.</p><p>He said the Lib Dems would take a \"kicking\" for being in government as he appeared to distance himself from Nick Clegg by saying the party leader had decided to focus the Lib Dem campaign on the EU. Speaking on Sky News, Cable said: \"The party leader took the gamble of fighting a European election on the issue of Europe, which is a very unusual thing to do in the UK. We'll see.\"</p><p>Cable said that all the main parties would suffer poor results. But he added: \"We are in government. We take a kicking for the things that government does that are unpopular. It does reflect on us.\"</p><p>He said he had not been comfortable about forming a coalition with the Tories. \"We put personal preferences aside and deal with it professionally … We have done massive things in government. We have risen to the challenge.\"</p><p>One longstanding critic of Clegg, the former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, called for him to go as the very first results showed the party's vote had collapsed, even though it was holding some wards in Lib Dem constituencies in Birmingham and Redcar.</p><p>Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem international development minister, said Ukip's \"stunning success\" was a protest at the dissembling of the political class. She added: \"We are so guarded and so on message that we have lost our humanity. We are the whipping boy of the coalition.\"</p><h2>Tories look towards Newark byelection </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609940'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400746193874/9fde0cae-9521-49fa-bd4b-8d15647715b6-460x276.jpeg' alt='David Cameron and his wife Samantha.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>David Cameron and his wife Samantha.

that the Ukip bubble could be burst.</p><p>But the prime minister will have to endure the possibility that Ukip will be able to claim on Sunday night that it has achieved its main political objective

That surely pushes towards a coupon of some kind.\"</p><p>The MP for north east Somerset was referring to the general election of 1918, dubbed the \"coupon election\" in which the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George and the Conservative leader issued a letter of endorsement to candidates who supported them.</p><p>But Shapps rejected a pact out of hand. He told the BBC: \"We are not going to have pacts or joint candidates. It can't happen on a technical basis because we do not allow joint candidates to stand.

We are the best chance of offering an in/out referendum.\"</p><p>The Tories agreed a pact with the Ulster Unionist party in 2010.</p><p>Shapps spoke out after Douglas Carswell, a leading Eurosceptic who favours a UK exit from the EU, suggested that Ukip could decide not to stand against Tories who voted in favour of an EU referendum in a Commons vote in 2011.

If David Cameron is as serious about an in/out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel Farage is as serious about an exit as he claims, the two of them need to do a deal.</p><p>\"The law already allows joint candidates.

Labour finished with 35 to the Tories' 25 and the Lib Dems' surviving three.</p><p>The men and women in red rosettes who prowled and huddled on the floor of the Grade-II-listed town hall in Ilford, where the count took place, kept their lips tight throughout the night except to say that it was going to be close. But now the council's new leader-in-waiting, Jas Athwal, can take his party into new governing territory, proving that the fringes of the metropolis, its more diverse parts at least, are increasingly ready to embrace it.</p><p>Labour is putting its success in Redbridge down to old-fashioned doorstep campaigning, listening hard and offering radical and practical policies.</p><p>Wes Streeting, Athwal's young deputy and parliamentary candidate for the Labour target of Ilford North, stressed nitty-gritty issues such as residents' dissatisfaction with cuts to street cleaning services and his party's promise to put that right. \"We offered clear and specific pledges that we know we can honour. There was a huge lack of trust in the previous administration,\" Streeting said.</p><p>He said Athwal's administration would demonstrate dynamism in the face of impending central government cuts: \"Redbridge has a reputation for not being very forward thinking. We need to recreate local government here.\"</p><p>Visiting Ilford as the count got under way, Sadiq Khan, the MP for Tooting who is running Labour's London campaigns, spoke of \"bold policies and speaking directly to Londoners\". He said that with local newspapers disappearing and most of the national press not on Labour's side it was vitally important to campaign well on the ground and make the best use of social media.</p><p>\"People here in Redbridge are finding that the council here has not been on their side,\" he said, noting that Labour had won three Redbridge seats that had seemed solidly Conservative. \"The Tories are going backwards and we are going forwards.\"</p>","headline":"Local elections: Labour wins control of Redbridge council for first time","trailText":"Conservative-Lib-Dem coalition is overthrown in east London borough as Labour gains majority of seven","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400837445463/Wes-Streeting-006.jpg","wordcount":"367","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"437618806","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9078683","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dave Hill","internalPageCode":"2097751","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T09:38:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-elections-labour-wins-redbridge-council-east-london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-elections-labour-wins-redbridge-council-east-london","tags":[{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davehill","webTitle":"Dave Hill","rcsId":"GNL064289","r2ContributorId":"21999","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/29/Dave_Hill.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dave Hill is a novelist, blogger, occasional broadcaster and long-standing writer for the Guardian.

From a standing start, Ukip made progress, not winning any seats but pushing the Tories into third place in four of the 19 wards up for grabs. To complete an unsatisfactory day for the Tories, the party's leader, Rob Garnham, was ousted after 18 years as a councillor.</p><p>The Cheltenham Liberal Democrat MP, Martin Horwood, expressed delight at the result. \"I think it shows we're in the right place for next year's general election,\" he said.</p><p>Horwood said he believed the general election in the town would still be a two-horse race between the Tories and Lib Dems and partly blamed the media's \"obsession\" with Farage for Ukip's success. \"Anyone who gets that sort of coverage is going to have a surge,\" he said. \"But I think this will be their high water mark.\"</p><p>Steve Jordan, the leader of the council, said the borough election campaign had been a \"dry-run\" for next year's general election battle. \"We have a hard-working MP and a council that people think is doing the right thing most of the time.

But she said the party's core messages on Europe and immigration were chiming with voters.</p><p>\"I think people are also realising that we are not the idiots the other parties and the media want to make us out to be,\" she said. \"They patronise us and try to make out we don't know what we're talking about just because they don't agree with us. But what we're saying is making sense to good, ordinary people.\"</p><p>Garnham, the ousted Tory leader, claimed the Lib Dems had gunned for him because they wanted to show they could reverse the national trend against Nick Clegg's party. \"They targeted me from day one; they wanted me out.

In 2010, Tory Zameer Hussain Shah won with 2,357 votes (36.6% share).</p><p>Whitaker said of the loss: \"It's Asian politics, I'm afraid. In Bradford we have a lot of politics based on family membership or clan membership.\"</p><p>Despite high hopes of walking away with five or more seats in Bradford, Ukip only gained one, in the Keighley West ward, which it took from Labour with a majority of 166.</p><p>The anti-Eu party hoped to dislodge the Conservative opposition leader Glenn Miller, but he clung on to his Worth Valley seat with a 215 majority.</p><p>Ukip were also optimistic in Bradford's Queensbury about dethroning Paul Crombie, an ex BNP councillor who left the far-right party in 2011 after becoming a Christian and becoming disillusioned with party politics. He and his wife, also originally elected on a BNP ticket, both turned Independent a few years ago. But on Thursday he increased his majority after vowing to fight purely on local issues.</p><p>Labour now has 46 seats on the city council, giving them a majority of one and overall control. They won two seats from the Tories (<a href=\"http://www.bradford.gov.uk/asp/elections/resultsDetailL.asp?id=117&amp;eid=10\">Thornton and Allerton</a> and Bowling and Barkerend), and one from the Peace party (Heaton), lost Keighley West to Ukip and held the rest.</p>","headline":"Labour gains control of Bradford as Respect fails","trailText":"Two years on from the Bradford Spring, George Galloway's anti-war party walked away empty handed at local elections which left Labour in overall control - and the Tories licking their wounds, blaming 'Asian' clan politics for their poor show","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400863203163/4cb3c1b4-0a8b-44f5-a514-664913b205e5-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"604","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437663794","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"537f7892e4b0be668b586bbe","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Pidd northern editor","internalPageCode":"2098195","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T18:15:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/may/23/labour-gains-control-of-bradford-george-galloway-respect-fails","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/may/23/labour-gains-control-of-bradford-george-galloway-respect-fails","tags":[{"id":"uk/the-northerner","webTitle":"The Northerner","description":"The Guardian brings you news and views from the north of England","type":"blog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/the-northerner","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"uk/bradford","webTitle":"Bradford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bradford","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/bradford","references":[]},{"id":"politics/georgegalloway","webTitle":"George Galloway","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgegalloway","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/georgegalloway","references":[]},{"id":"politics/respect-party","webTitle":"Respect party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/respect-party","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/respect-party","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399294395431/Helen-Pidd-byline-NEW-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

But on Friday morning, Nigel Farage was credited with an act of even greater political absurdity for a rightwing leader: helping drive out the Conservatives and paving the way for a Labour victory.</p><p>Long after dawn broke in the south London borough, the Conservative leader of eight years, Mike Fisher, conceded a crushing defeat to Labour, saying it had not won the vote but Ukip had lost it for the Conservatives. It was not entirely true – Labour increased its vote in key wards and delivered turnouts of close to 50% in some cases. But with Ukip consistently coming second and third in wards there was truth in the Conservative warning of \"Vote Ukip, get Labour\".</p><p>\"When we were canvassing nobody was saying they were for Ukip because it's still a guilty secret,\" said Fisher. \"But the level of support has come out today. Voters are using this as an opportunity to rebel and I hope that when it comes to the general election people will look at the policies of the main parties. The annoying thing here is that Ukip have lots of votes but no seats. Many of those Ukip voters are Conservatives and they will be horrified to wake up this morning to a Labour council.\"</p><p>That annoyance at Ukip's \"cranks and gadflies\" disruption of the normal order of politics threatens to turn into something more serious if Ukip's momentum is maintained into the 2015 election. All around the counting hall, beleaguered Tories muttered about Ukip's destructive impact, taking their votes if not their seats. Deep sighs could be heard from the defeated candidates, many of whom seemed dazed by the scale of the beating.</p><p>\"My hope is the Ukip bubble won't last that long,\" said Tim Pollard, outgoing deputy leader of the council. \"It seems people feel entitled to vote a little irresponsibly. That's just the rough and tumble of politics.\"</p><p>Labour has been out of power in Croydon since 2006 and came back with a bang, taking a 10-seat majority, overturning a four-seat deficit at the 2010 election. It campaigned hard in key areas on housing and employment opportunities and won seven seats from the Conservatives, wiping them out completely in two wards. It was a blow for Gavin Barwell, the Tory MP for Croydon Central who oversaw the campaign and who had to watch as marginal wards in his marginal constituency fell to Labour. Labour's candidate for the general election, Sarah Jones, was left buoyed with confidence for next May.</p><p>\"We are going to have a historic victory for Labour here in Croydon,\" said the Labour leader Tony Newman as he won his own seat early on Friday morning. \"We have to make sure that we start next week to clean up Croydon. We took the decision early on to fight on a positive manifesto and to bring back the decency to politics and we faced a negative campaign from our opponents. I think this victory is not down to Ukip. It may have had some impact, but I think it is voters coming out and backing our plans for Croydon.\" Among the victorious Labour candidates was Emily Benn, 24, granddaughter of Tony Benn and the fifth generation of her family to have entered politics.</p><p>Ukip stressed it had also taken votes from Labour, notably from what it terms \"the left-behinds\" – older working-class voters.</p><p>\"The Conservatives sounded their own death knell by running an administration that lacked transparency and accountability,\" said Peter Staveley, chairman of Ukip for south and central Croydon. Ukip had targeted Croydon with 42 candidates, including nine black candidates in an effort to reinforce Farage's insistence that his party is not racist. It was also a response to the fact that Croydon has one of the UK's fastest-rising ethnic minority populations. In 2001 70% of the south London borough's population was white. By 2021 the council predicts that will be almost halved to 40%.</p><p>But Ukip's organisation was chaotic and one of its black candidates, Herman Lyken, who had appeared with Farage on stage at a major Ukip rally, admitted he hardly campaigned.</p><p>\"I only joined the party the other day,\" he said. \"I didn't do much campaigning. It has been very low-key.\"</p><p>Winston McKenzie, Ukip's candidate for South Norwood, said its campaign in Croydon had been holed by allegations the party was racist.</p><p>\"This has been one of the worst elections I have ever known in terms of people saying Ukip is racist,\" he said. \"Croydon has really taken it on board and this has really damaged Ukip. All sections of the media and all three main parties have come together to devise a way to demean Ukip and divide the people.\"</p>","headline":"Ukip vote helps hand Croydon to Labour","trailText":"Conservatives blame Ukip as they concede crushing defeat in south London borough where Nigel Farage's party held 'carnival'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400842483796/Croydon-vote-count-006.jpg","wordcount":"789","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437627576","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9079331","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Robert Booth","internalPageCode":"2097823","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T10:57:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-vote-croydon-labour-conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-vote-croydon-labour-conservatives","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertbooth","webTitle":"Robert Booth","r2ContributorId":"19584","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Robert Booth is a news reporter on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a>.

I'm a big fan of Ed but we've all got to work harder to get our message across.\"</p><p>Swindon is an important battleground . The Tories began the night in control of the council with a majority of just one (Conservative: 29, Labour 23, Lib Dem four, Independent one). Labour hoped that the council would at least slip into no overall control, but the Tories ended up with 30 seats to Labour's 23 and the Lib Dems' four.</p><p>The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, did not visit Swindon during the local election campaign but his party made strong gains, finishing in second place in some Tory and Labour stronghold wards.</p><p>John Short, the leader of Ukip in Swindon, said the party had made huge progress in the town. \"Locally and nationally, people are looking for a change.\" he said.</p><p>Conceding Ukip had done well, Grant said: \"Ukip's good performance shows that the voters are disaffected with the mainstream political parties. We really do need to look at a way of reaching our core voters. We have to reconnect with working people in a way that clearly we're not doing at the moment.\"</p><p>Grant added  that the Tory vote had held up while Labour seemed to have suffered in marginal seats. \"There's a lot of work to be done before next year's general election,\" he said.</p><p>Short, a former council deputy chief executive, said Ukip party membership had increased by 50% during the campaign as the party fought on local issues including the shortage of council houses. Concerns about immigration were also a frequent subject of conversation on the doorstep, he said, adding: \"We aren't against immigration; we want to control it. We're not racist, we're not fascist, we're not homophobic.\"</p><p>The result in Swindon is important because it is regarded as a barometer town – whoever wins in its two seats at the general election wins power at Westminster.</p><p>It was also particularly important for Labour to do well because it would be an encouraging sign that they could win seats in the south of England at next year's general election.</p><p>But although the Tories have introduced some unpopular policies, such as charging £40 a year for green waste collections, and are planning to lease out all their leisure centres and golf course, Labour accepted it had failed to make enough progress.</p>","headline":"Labour fails to oust Tories in Swindon","trailText":"Conservative party retains control of the town hall, days after gaffe by Labour leader Ed Miliband","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400806426087/Ed-Miliband-006.jpg","wordcount":"459","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437595115","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9078498","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Steven Morris","internalPageCode":"2097642","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T00:54:21Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-conservatives-swindon-council-election","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-conservatives-swindon-council-election","tags":[{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/swindon","webTitle":"Swindon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/swindon","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/swindon","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stevenmorris","webTitle":"Steven Morris","rcsId":"GNL004769","r2ContributorId":"16487","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/steven_morris_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Steven Morris is a reporter for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">Guardian</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevenmorris","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/stevenmorris","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-437595509","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400806419383/Ed-Miliband-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Andrew Yates","altText":"Ed Miliband","suppliersReference":"530020970","height":"54","credit":"Andrew Yates/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Ed Miliband at Sutton village hall, Yorkshire after voting on 22 May.

The assertive victory was seized on by the anti-EU party as proof that it appeals to working-class Labour voters as well as disaffected Tories. The results far exceeded Ukip hopes and Labour's worst fears.</p><p>The anti-EU party won seven seats from Labour and two from the Conservatives and held the one seat it won in a byelection last year. It also scooped up votes from the disintegrating British National Party, which had two councillors in its 2008 peak. Labour will keep control of the council it has run for 80 years, but Ukip is now the official opposition.</p><p>Deputy leader Jahangir Akhtar, first elected in 2000, lost his seat after being embroiled in Rotherham's child sex grooming scandal. He was accused of covering up abuse by his cousin – a charge he has always denied. He stepped down for several months while police investigated and was reinstated late year when detectives decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute.</p><p>He will lose his £21,443 salary after being ousted in his Rotherham West ward by Maureen Vines, whose husband, Caven Vines, held his seat in Rawmarsh. Last year's byelection saw Vines become Ukip's first directly elected councillor in Rotherham.</p><p>Another high-profile victim was Richard Russell, the Labour member for Rother Vale and cabinet member for waste. Responding to the defeat, John Healey, Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne, said: \"It's a message for all the political parties: wake up. People are angry. They are saying they aren't hearing enough of what they feel in what we are politicians are saying.\"</p><p>He added: \"For me today was compounded when I was out knocking on doors and one man, a lifelong Labour voter, said to me: 'John, I'm voting for Ukip today. You all need a kicking'.\"</p><p>Roger Stone, the leader of Rotherham council, said Ukip's victory was part of a national trend rather than something particular about Rotherham. \"Most of the things Ukip were saying were about immigration and Europe, which they can do nothing about [at a local council level],\" he said.</p><p>Asked whether it was good for democracy that Rotherham would have a proper opposition for the first time in a while, Stone disagreed, saying: \"We've always had opposition.\"</p><p>Until Thursday Labour had 57 councillors in Rotherham, with the Conservatives on four and one Independent and one Ukip.</p><p>One of the new Ukip councillors, local businessman John Turner – who served as a Tory councillor before quitting David Cameron's party a few years ago after a row involving his reselection – said Ukip had done so well because people were fed up of Labour in Rotherham, regularly singled out as a \"Rotten Borough\" in Private Eye.</p><p>He said: \"We won for two reasons. Immigration issues. And a common enemy: the Labour party in Rotherham. They have been in power for 80 years. They feel they own Rotherham. They've got in debt, they are doing everything wrong. They don't allow even a degree of democracy in the council chamber: no videoing, no proper minute keeping, no recording of meetings. We are going to try to force Rotherham council to become more democratic. We still expect to be treated with ignominy but hopefully as a consolidated group we will be able to fight for a glimmer of democracy.\"</p><p>Ukip's local party has grown in size and confidence since coming a strong second in a byelection at the end of 2012 (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/30/labour-rotherham-byelection-ukip). Labour held the seat following the resignation of Denis MacShane over his expenses, but Jane Collins – who is top of Ukip's list in Yorkshire for the european elections – managed 21%, a steep increase on her party's performance in the seat in the 2010 general election.</p><p>But even local organiser John Wilkinson admitted Thursday's haul of ten wins far exceeded expectations.

The first tremors of the political earthquake have been felt. The canary may even be asphyxiated in the coal mine. Whatever the chosen metaphor, four-party politics has arrived in Britain, and the only question is whether it will ever go away.</p><p>Labour can fairly claim it is doing marginally better than the first local election results indicated on Thursday night, but Nigel Farage can reasonably say now that Ukip has an imprint in local government under a first-past-the-post system. And he is promising that the imprint will deepen, and provide the basis to win constituency seats in the general election.</p><p>The results have also confirmed, if confirmation was needed, that Ukip can damage Labour as much as the Conservatives, meaning both main parties need to throw out the old methods to project swings and to forecast the marginal seats it will gain.</p><p>For instance, in the West Midlands a strong Ukip performance has meant Labour has not made the gains it had hoped in Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall. \"Worcester man\" has also not gone Labour.</p><p>In traditional Labour heartlands, such as Rotherham, Ukip came first in 10, and 2nd in 11 of the 21 seats it fought. Equally, Ukip's performance in the east of England suggests some of the gains the Tories need to secure an overall Commons majority will be elusive. Thatcher's \"(South) Essex man\" is morphing into Ukip man. Thurrock, Basildon and Castle Point are all in play for the UK Independence party.</p><p>The exception for the moment seems to be London. The capital has its own house prices, its own multi-cultural population and now, almost its own politics. The city that spawned the recession seems to be the part of the country least hit by its consequences, and most willing to back Labour. There will be exceptions, such as Barking, where the former BNP vote is likely to head to Ukip.</p><p>The impressive Labour gains in London also reflect the strength of the activist base in the capital where its \"get out the vote\" operation had some successes.</p><p>One Labour strategist insisted: \"I would rather be where we are this morning than where [Conservative party campaign consultant] Lynton Crosby is. There is a massive wave sweeping over politics called four-party politics. But there is also a strong current to Labour. We think we will make over 200 gains.\"</p><p>The sources continued to insist that Labour was winning where it mattered and pointed to good results outside London in Cambridge, Lincoln, Amber Valley Peterborough and Carlisle.</p><p>Labour accepts that by the time of the general election next year the Ukip vote will not have shrunk back to the 3% it secured in the 2010 general election, but it still believes that the bulk of the Ukip damage then will be inflicted on the Conservatives.</p><p>Still, there will be a deep inquest into the Labour campaign, and why it has been as much the victim of the anti-politics mood as the governing parties. The doorstep issue of Ed Miliband exists. Parts of the campaign malfunctioned: if you are planning to take Swindon council, you need to know the name of the Labour leader on said council; if you are campaigning on the cost of living, you need to know the cost of living.</p><p>But Miliband insists he understands the discontent in the communities that have voted Ukip and is assembling the practical policies to address an anger with politics that has been building for decades. It is the approach Barack Obama took with the Tea Party in the US. It means no name-calling, but addressing the causes of the discontent instead.</p><p>That said, Miliband put out a lot of policy in this campaign and it seems not to have had enough of an effect on the doorstep. The Labour backbench will now demand a much more explicit attack on Ukip.</p><p>Some Labour MPs, such as John Spellar, John Healey, Peter Hain and John Mann, have long been arguing for the party to go on the front foot about Ukip, exposing them as modern-day Thatcherites bent on flat taxes and NHS privatisation. At one point, there was a plan to go after Ukip at the start of the campaign, but it was shelved.</p><p>Miliband has only a year to win over this disillusioned vote.</p><p>The chair of the British Future thinktank, Sunder Katwala, has already divided Ukip support into three groups, each of broadly similar size: \"tactical Ukip\", \"engage-able Ukip\" and \"rejectionist Ukip\".</p><p>Tactical Ukip was simply lending its vote to Farage for the purposes of the European campaign, he says. Rejectionist Ukip is irreconcilable with the political class. Engage-able Ukip voters, he says, \"are those who could vote for a major party in 2015 which is still making a credible pitch for a broad enough electoral coalition to seek to govern. These are the voters who will make the difference between Ukip scoring 6% or reaching 10-12% or higher in the general election, and may determine the success or failure for their major rivals too\" .</p><p>Cameron thinks that by pointing to the threat of Miliband in Downing Street he has the secret weapon to win back defectors to Ukip. Equally, Miliband thinks traditional Labour voters will recoil at the thought of a second term for Cameron, and Ukip's appeal to older white working-class men does not mean Labour will lose heartland seats.</p><p>The next year will reveal the truth.</p>","headline":"Election results prove Ukip can damage Labour as well as Tories","trailText":"<p>Both parties need to rethink their campaign

live blog</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:05Z","body":"<p><strong>1.</strong> Parties can win an election without winning. On paper, Labour clearly won. They have gained more than 250 seats, and they are easily ahead on projected national share. If Britons voted like this in a general election, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. But it hasn't felt like a victory for them. If you want to know who feels as if they've won an election, ignore what politicians say, turn the volume down and look at their faces on TV. Who's happiest? It's definitely Ukip first, then probably the Conservatives, then Labour, then the Lib Dems. That's because, given the likelihood of the gap between Labour and the Conservatives closing between now and 2015, Labour know this isn't good enough to offer a strong chance of victory.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. </strong>Ukip's chances of winning the European elections don't look as good as they did on Thursday evening. Their national vote share is down six points compared to last year, and, although there must be some people who voted Ukip in the Euros and for another party in the locals, there must be a chance that the polls saying Ukip would win have got it wrong.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong> Labour now fully realise that Ukip presents them with a serious electoral threat. This shouldn't be a surprise. Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Revolt-Right-Explaining-Extremism-Democracy/dp/0415661501/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399622168&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain\">have written a very good book</a> making this very case. But it has taken a while for the message to get through.</p><p></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Labour's post-election inquest will probably be more serious than the Conservatives'. Journalists expected these elections to trigger a mini crisis in the Conservative party, but there has been no evidence of that at all. A few Eurosceptics have renewed their call for a pact with Ukip, but this is an absolute non-starter, and they know it; generally, the Eurosceptics have decided not to cause trouble. But the public comments from Labour figures suggest the party is going to conduct a proper postmortem, not into Ed Miliband's leadership (they are stuck with him, for better or worse), but into whether their Ukip strategy is correct. And that's because ...</p><p></p><p><strong>5.</strong> None of the parties have a clue what to do about Ukip. Politicians from all the main parties have been saying much the same thing: that voters have sent them a message, and that they must listen. But there is no real agreement what the message is, or what they should do about it.</p><p></p><p><strong>6.</strong> A second hung parliament looks increasingly inevitable. Four-party politics is increasingly entrenched in English politics (as in Scottish and Welsh politics, only they have a different four parties), and that makes it harder for any of them to win outright.</p><p></p><p><strong>7.</strong> The Lib Dems are vulnerable even in their strongholds. Last year they thought they had hit rock bottom in the local elections. They hadn't. Although they are holding on in some Lib Dem areas, in others they are losing seats. The BBC say even Vince Cable would lose his seat on the basis of today's results.</p><p></p><p><strong>8.</strong> London really is different from the rest of the country electorally. It seems to be the only place in England impervious to Ukip's charms. Like Scotland. (Perhaps if Scotland goes independent we Londoners could join up with them, share the pound, and leave the rest of England with something Ukip-ish, like the groat?)</p>","headline":"Eight things we

Ukip may have prevented my Conservative colleagues and me from winning seats last week – the margin of my defeat was narrower than the Ukip vote – but watching the count there were a surprising number of votes split between Ukip and the Liberal Democrats, and Ukip and Labour.</p><p></p><p>I am sure the voters I spoke to were not racist or frustrated by political correctness. They were not intolerant of all migrants, or desperate to criticise Romanians. Call it electionitis, call it a desire to use ammunition against an opposing political party – but I rushed to call out every example of bigotry that hit the national headlines. I couldn't have been more eager to criticise Nigel Farage for racism, and in doing so I made a fundamental mistake.</p><p></p><p>Until we understand Ukip voters and until we respect the motivations behind their choices, they will continue to rise in the polls. People do not vote for Ukip in such numbers because they are racist. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/24/george-osbornes-speech-at-conservativehome-conference-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">Lord Ashcroft's polling</a> shows that 24% of the people who voted Ukip on 22 May would prefer Ed Miliband to David Cameron as prime minister. Eight per cent had previously voted Liberal Democrat.</p><p>This isn't a party fuelled by racism but one that taps into the feeling of disenfranchisement among the less well-off. Ukip's tone resonates with those who might have been traditional working-class Labour and Conservative voters. Support for Ukip on the doorstep was voiced as support for a party that understood the concerns of ordinary voters, and the three main parties need to learn this lesson.</p><p></p><p>Southwark used to be a Lib Dem stronghold. I was astonished by the numbers of doors opened by people who previously voted Lib Dem but were going to vote Ukip. When asked to unpack that, the ones who generously gave their time explained that their concern was about immigration. They said that the area had been filled with migrants pushing up the cost of housing  and preventing their children from finding homes. Southwark's popularity as a place to live, because it's near the City, has brought in large numbers of young professionals – many of whom I spoke to, who had come to work in London from abroad. More established working-class residents don't feel squeezed out culturally by immigration but economically.</p><p></p><p>There is an argument raging about why London doesn't reflect the national polls when it comes to Ukip support. The party didn't do anywhere near as well in the capital as it did elsewhere. Some claim it shows how ethnically diverse London is, and how tolerant. I don't believe that London is any more tolerant than any other parts of Britain. What it has is wealth, and a property market that has pushed out working-class residents. Thus in London Ukip has both smaller networks of activists and fewer people likely to vote for it.</p><p></p><p>When the main parties are able to unveil policies that assure the least well-off that they are on their side, when the housing market doesn't make people scared that their children will never own homes, then support for Ukip will collapse. When Ukip supporters cite immigration, it's not because they don't like the faces of people moving in down the road, it's because they fear the road is now unaffordable for their children to live on.</p><p></p><p>I made the mistake of calling Ukip racist on the basis of the party's incompetence at selecting good candidates, but demonising its supporters means alienating them further from the political establishment. We would do better to get behind them and bring them back to parties that don't just reflect their concerns, but have the competence to do something about them.</p>","headline":"Ukip supporters I met

is not easy to extrapolate from local election results, but these ones could suggest Labour falling just short of a working majority","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:03Z","body":"<p></p><p>\"Now this is just a bit of fun,\" Peter Snow used to say as he wielded his swingometer after each sensational byelection, to reveal the House of Commons stuffed with 500 Lib Dem MPs or whatever it was that would result if Britain as a whole voted the same way in a proper election – which, of course, this was not.</p><p>Extrapolating from the council elections to next year's general election is not quite such a silly exercise, seeing as large parts of the country were voting at once, and the real concerns that people have with their town halls mean a protest vote is not quite the same free hit that it can be in a parliamentary byelection.</p><p>Projecting general election results from local election polls is fraught because an expected 36% turnout is little more than half what is likely next year, and that is only within that (mostly urban, and exclusively English) half of Britain that has a council vote.</p><p>The European ballot boxes, opened on Sunday night, are a sounder basis for projection in the sense that the whole of the UK had MEPs to elect, but seeing as the Euro-parliament is so remote and poorly understood, these elections have been heavily prone to protest voting, from the great Green surge of 1989 onwards, which disappears by the time of the real contest.</p><p>Sky News calculations using the share of vote so far project a House of Commons with Labour on 322 seats, which is 64 up on 2010 and just four short of the 326 required for a working majority. The Tories would drop back 45 to 261, very close to Labour's 258 last time around, suggesting that a general election today would produce something of a mirror image of the one that took place four years ago.</p><p>There would be a bigger difference for the Lib Dems, who would shed 20 MPs, more than a third of their total, being reduced to 37. From Berwick to Birmingham and on to Bude (in North Cornwall), Nick Clegg's party would suffer defeats on this sort of a result, if the swing were uniform. But then the patchy nature of the town hall results strongly suggests the swing would not be uniform, making it hard to make confident projections of a loss in anything but the most marginal seat.</p><p>The most striking feature of the forecast of all, however, concerns the minor parties. The assorted parliamentary \"others\" would come back with just 30 seats, only one more than last time, a reminder that despite the great slice of the electorate that Ukip appealed to, the voting system for the Commons – which requires parties to concentrate enough votes to come out ahead in particular locations – still represents a formidable obstacle in the way of insurgent parties seeking to break the mould.</p><p>The psephologist Rob Ford, of Manchester University, says: \"We know that people vote differently in local and national elections, so you have to be careful. But we can get some sense of the relative standing of the parties based on real votes, which is always interesting.\"</p><p>In particular, Ford – who has co-authored a new book on Ukip – believes that the geography of the council results can tell us something about the battleground for 2015. \"There is an increasingly stark contrast between diverse metropolitan England and particularly London on the one hand\", he says, \"and what we might call 'middle England' small towns on the other. Labour is shoring up well big cities, but is – just like the Tories – being squeezed by Ukip elsewhere.\"</p><p>For 2015, Ford believes, this suggests there are at least large parts of the country where Ukip's strength in voting for councils could play an important role in 2015.</p>","headline":"What do the council results mean for the 2015 general election?","trailText":"It is not easy to extrapolate from local election results, but these ones could suggest Labour falling just short of a working majority","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400857656826/Ukip-supporters-006.jpg","wordcount":"622","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437651848","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9080130","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Clark","internalPageCode":"2098081","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T15:11:24Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/what-council-results-mean-2015-general-election","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/what-council-results-mean-2015-general-election","tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"politics/liberaldemocrats","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tomclark","webTitle":"Tom Clark","r2ContributorId":"19161","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/16/1308240664690/tom_clark_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Clark is a leader writer for the Guardian.

It was almost as unpleasant as some of the views of the Ukip leader and the out-there candidates who were crash-landing in the news – a collective outbreak of sneering, which started to transcend the party itself and blur into a generalised mockery of anyone minded to support it. You could see it most clearly in the rash of satirical(ish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhyImVotingUkip?src=hash\" title=\"\">#WhyImVotingUkip tweets</a> that are piling up even now (eg \"Because our true British maypoles are set to be completely replaced by foreign gay Poles within 5 years\" or \"Because I'm uneducated,uncultured, white and old\") and it's not pretty: an apparent belief that to vote UKIP is to be an idiot of some description, either bigoted or duped, and worthy of little more than contempt.</p><p>If you remain of that opinion, you should stop reading and go somewhere else. As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\" title=\"\">local election results come in and Ukip's numbers continue to look remarkable</a>, the rest of us should maybe pause for thought and realise that something rather sobering is afoot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/04/ukip-farage-local-election-results\" title=\"\">as happened in the 2012 county council elections</a>, only more so.

Moreover, if people are supporting Ukip in such large numbers – even after the media's massed guns have been rattling at it for weeks – it is probably time to drop all the sneering and think about why.</p><p>So far, neither side of politics has even the beginnings of an adequate response. Listening to senior Conservatives this morning (Michael Gove on BBC Breakfast was a good example), you would think they simply need to further turn the screw on welfare and immigration and everything will be OK. Equally, when the left pipes up about Ukip voters' worries being reducible to either the \"cost of living crisis\" or a tangle of concerns around job markets and public services, they get nowhere near the whole story.</p><p>The truth is that the Ukip surge is built around a multitude of factors that wrong-foot both left and right. And on my side of politics, the most difficult stuff to process is about things from which the left tends to avert its eyes: notions of identity and belonging, anxiety about accelerated change and the fact that that leftie hooray-word \"community\" can actually have chewy connotations. Crudely put, when you meet a Labour-Ukip switcher who expresses worries about immigration, you can't simply reduce what they say to falling wages and the lack of social housing.</p><p>Immigration and people's responses to it are complex beyond words: they test just about every article of faith across the political spectrum.</p><p>I am writing this piece in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/ukip-little-england-east-anglia-lincolnshire-elections\" title=\"\">Great Yarmouth, where the borough council count has yet to start</a>, but a few hours spent talking to people outside polling stations underlined all those themes, and more. What was most telling, though, was the fact that so many people were engaged with what was happening and under precious few illusions. Given that Ukip is a non-story in London, the metropolitan media will presumably continue to misunderstand it and patronise its voters, but one misapprehension needs to be corrected, and fast: Ukip voters do not form some blind personality cult and neither are they unaware of the often unpleasant views of the party's people. Mention Farage and you hear things such as, \"I don't trust him either\". Yet again, \"complicated\" doesn't even begin to describe it.</p><p>This is not some bolt from the blue. The two – no, three – party system is in deep crisis. It looks like there is no way back to the world where either Labour or the Tories compete to break through the magic 40% barrier and all is largely well. The Liberal Democrats look to have had it. Meanwhile, Scotland is threatening to pull away from the UK and the result of next year's general election, let alone what will happen in its aftermath, is anyone's guess.</p><p>In my hotel room – at a ring-road Travelodge, in case anyone was wondering – a succession of Westminster faces are blathering on the television and I have just received a text message from an activist friend in response to one I sent which read, \"I love the smell of toast in the morning\". He wrote: \"We can all smell the coffee. Ed, Cameron et al refuse to act because it's all about them. How long can it last?\"</p>","headline":"Ukip's success is no false dawn – it's time to stop sneering","trailText":"<strong>John Harris: </strong>The local election results show that Nigel Farage's

They are the biggest demographic <br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/may/16/non-voters-photography-felicity-mccabe\" title=\"\">Felicity McCabe's pictures of non-voters</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:05Z","body":"<p>I do hope you're sitting down, because as political slogans go, the following is likely to excite you. So hold on to your hats, and here goes: we need a new kind of apathy. With just a year to go before the general election, I can think of no single more achievable boost to our democracy than having a none-of-the-above box added to every 2015 ballot paper, and an amendment to media regulations insisting that the disaffected be formally represented in all TV studios and other forums in the runup to polling day. They may well be the biggest political demographic.</p><p>At the time of writing, it was unclear how many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\" title=\"\">people voted</a> in the local and European elections, but one thing was crystal: the vast majority didn't. It doesn't look to have been a historically low showing, estimated at about 36%. But with predictions that next year's big one could rival the philosophically illegitimising depth of Labour taking 35% of a 61% turnout in 2005, how long should politicians be ethically permitted to ignore such a vast constituency?</p><p>A very long time indeed, were they to get their way. It is notable that the more obvious apathy seems to have become, via social media and so on, the more perversely inward looking politicians have got. They pretend they haven't noticed it; they refuse to conduct anything remotely resembling proper research into why it might be happening; they talk in ever more weird language. The only thing more pronounced than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-election-chief-politics-as-usual-douglas-alexander\" title=\"\">voter apathy</a> has been the politicians' utter apathy towards doing anything about it.</p><p>So, yes, I keep reading that our politics is broken – but our apathy seems more pressingly knackered, because it's evidently so easy to discount it. You would scarcely know it existed from the election coverage, which valiantly discusses Thursday's minority activity the only way people seem to know how.</p><p>Even now, and in the coming days and weeks, the talk will be about how Cameron can alter his attack, or what Miliband must tactically rethink, or the meaning of Nigel Farage. It's the same incestuous, bubblicious way of talking about a world that appears to mostly ignore earthlings that has turned so many of those people off or driven them into the arms of protest voting. Behold our incredible shrinking politics, where the parties apparently see nothing wrong, practically or morally, in pursuing 35% strategies or dividing a few key marginals into titchy subgroups, and lavishing untold resources on targeting those voters almost personally with marketing as micro-sophisticated as it is a macro screw-you to everyone else.</p><p>Why do we need a none-of-the-above box when people are already perfectly entitled to spoil their ballot papers? My gut feeling is that for many perfectly nice British voters who feel they ought to turn out, spoiling a ballot is a graffiti-ish act of rebellion with which they would feel reflexively uncomfortable in a way that they wouldn't with putting a cross in a legitimised none-of-the-above box. And if you think that makes the Great British public sound preposterously meek, then do consider that this is a country whose most prominent so-called rebels are the tweed-jacketed Farage and the prime ministerial tennis partner Jeremy Clarkson.</p><p>Without wishing to crush anyone's self-image, it may be time to accept that Britain doesn't really \"do\" rebellion at this stage in its national journey. There's always Russell Brand, I suppose, and I occasionally picture him planning his revolution of a weekend, perhaps having motored down with his girlfriend, Jemima Khan, to her £20m Oxfordshire estate. But with the best will in the world, it's not exactly Wat Tyler.</p><p>For all that Brand's message of total disengagement from conventional politics speaks swiftly and seductively to many, it is disingenuously simplistic. He is an eloquent man, but I imagine his suggestion that all governments are exactly the same could be demolished in seconds by anyone whom coalition disability cuts have forced to scrimp on incontinence nappies.</p><p>For those without the luxury of time to wait until Russell's revolution coagulates, but who have really had it with voting with nosepegs, or tactically, or for people whose patio furniture or baroque home improvements they were stung for via the expenses racket, a none-of-the-above box would offer an alternative and considerably less ignorable way to be actively counted, and now.</p><p>At the very least, we might learn something. As the American psephological guru Nate Silver noted after he tried and failed to forecast the 2010 UK election with the same laser-like accuracy he brought to the US polls, the paucity of data about UK voting patterns is staggering. Silver contrasted the \"abundance of data\" collected before and after American votes with the failure to do even \"the bare minimum\" in the UK.</p><p>We aren't close to understanding many things about the way we decide how we're governed, and our overlords and ladies apparently don't care to assist us.

No. Not if the <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband-tucks-into-a-bacon-sandwich-on-a-morning-trip-to-buy-flowers-for-his-wife-9407561.html\" title=\"\">guy in question wants to be prime minister</a>, anyway. The cameras are always on and every mouthful will be judged. The personal is political, even at 6.30 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>The blurring of talent show contests and politics continues, with celebrity status sometimes counting for more than some of the traditional virtues of political leadership. Affability, or the appearance of it, beats seriousness. Jokes beat speeches. Soundbites beat policy.</p><p></p><p>Every Wednesday at noon, when parliament is sitting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/17/john-bercow-prime-ministers-questions-commons-speaker-mps\" title=\"\">prime minister's questions</a> confirms the extent to which political leadership has become a branch of showbusiness. It is like an open mic session at a not very good comedy club, with coachloads of sixth-formers in attendance. It is all very retro. And the script needs some work.</p><p></p><p>Which is odd, really, because out there in the real world the theory and practice of leadership are changing quite fast. There is nothing very retro about it. The interesting discussions about leadership, and the interesting exemplars, have little in common with the strutting and posing that goes on at the House of Commons and in politics generally.</p><p></p><p>Take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/zappos-shoes-profits-happiness-business\" title=\"\">Zappos</a>, for example, the American online retailer. It has embraced something known as \"<a href=\"http://holacracy.org/how-it-works\" title=\"\">holacracy</a>\", which means abandoning traditional hierarchy and abolishing managers' usual roles and job titles. Instead, employees form themselves into self-governing and interlinking circles based around core tasks. There are still leaders and leadership, of course, but not of a kind that many in London SW1 would recognise.</p><p></p><p>A similar, non-directive approach has existed at WL Gore, the engineering firm (and makers of Gore-Tex), for years. Here no one crudely tells anyone else what to do. \"Want to know if you're a leader?\" a WL Gore employee explained to the management guru Gary Hamel. \"Call a meeting and see if anyone shows up.\"</p><p></p><p>And at Google, leadership has also displayed some unconventional characteristics. In its early years of rapid growth employees were encouraged to spend up to a fifth of their time working on new ideas that interested them. When Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of the company, first started attending meetings there he said he could not tell the difference between graduate interns and the most senior staff: you led with ideas and argument, not rank. Google has become more conventional as it has grown to its current all-conquering position. But the origins of its success lie in the rejection of many elements of old-school leadership.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2826.Jim_Collins\" title=\"\">Jim Collins</a>, author of the best-selling business books Built to Last and Good to Great, argues that some of the most effective leaders eschew \"charisma\" and instead adopt a quiet, relentless, purposeful approach. \"Force of personality is not an argument,\" he told me once. \"It's not facts, it's not evidence, it's not data … Charisma is irrelevant. It's not good or bad, it's irrelevant.\"</p><p></p><p>Well-founded confidence, required by political or business leaders, is one thing. Braggadocio is another. Collins has a test for anyone who says that he or she is a leader. \"I ask them: 'What are you in it for?'\" Some people are in it for themselves. Others are trying to build something that will last, for the benefit of others. This is the test to apply to Messrs Cameron, Clegg and Miliband – and Osborne, May and Johnson too.</p><p></p><p>Politics is not supposed to be showbiz. Soundbites, \"jokes\", bullying and broadbrush statements may get you though PMQs, panel shows or shorter broadcast interviews. But something serious is supposed to be at stake. Fitness for office should really not be determined by how you eat a bacon sandwich at 6.30 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Of course the personal is political. We prefer interesting people to boring ones. Jokes can help. Public speaking is a skill that has too few capable exponents.</p><p></p><p>But the degeneration of our politics has led to a situation in which Nigel Farage can command the undivided and often unquestioning attention of much of our media and wider public. And this is what passes for leadership.</p><p></p><p>I do not follow.</p>","headline":"If bacon-sandwich charisma defines political leadership, only Nigel Farage wins","trailText":"<strong>Stefan Stern: </strong>Politics is not supposed to be about showbiz affability.

Where is the voice of the Labour party and why is it not supporting, loud and clear, the agenda Polly Toynbee has been advocating in your newspaper for so long? Where is the political anger about rising inequality in this country? Who is articulating the benefits of membership of the EU and the importance of our role in making it a force for good? Who is defending public services and utilities against the ravages of mass privatisation? Who is prepared to ignore short-term political and economic gain and say clearly that, unless addressing climate change becomes our number-one priority, the very future of our planet is in question?</p><p>We live in depressing times, with no political vision or leadership to capture the imagination. In this climate, Ukip and their like flourish.<br /><strong>Mike Worthington</strong><br /><em>Hexham, Northumberland</em></p><p></p><p>• On Thursday evening at the polling station there were no fewer than eight mad-frothing-at-the-mouth, little-England parties. It was like a two-legged thesaurus of how many different ways to say we hate foreigners, the EU, and we're scared. Even the polling officers could barely keep straight faces at all this madness. Yet one of these groupings, the kind we used to laugh at, Ukip, has made electoral gains.</p><p>I voted Green. And I will keep voting Green until Labour unites with it to form a progressive \"green\" coalition. I voted Green because I believe Labour will get nowhere much with progressives and the disillusioned until it seriously and openly takes on the Green agenda. That \"going green\" is the only project that offers hope and progress for our society and the world. The only system that offers real jobs and hope as we build a new infrastructure for a better kind of society. Caroline Lucas risked arrest for her principles and I admire that. That strength of purpose matters.</p><p>A sustainable, renewable world is our only hope. Forget Ukip – it's a symptom of despair, not an answer. Ed Balls fiddling with taxes is a boring and unimaginative anti-answer. Fighting climate change and saving ourselves and the creatures and plants of the world is the only progressive answer. The only possible answer. You can only reply to madness with sanity.<br /><strong>Olivia Byard</strong><br /><em>Witney, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Why can't politicians learn from history? If they want to win the next general election, they should learn from Ted Heath's big mistake. He called an election on the basis that the people should decide whether an elected government or the miners should run the country. He had to win on that basis, but in the last week he backed off and the rest is history. The only politician to learn from this was Margaret Thatcher; she set out her policies based on what she believed in and defended them through thick and thin. Likewise, Ukip has done well in these elections because everyone knows what they stand for.</p><p>The problem for the three main parties is that they either don't stand for anything or if they do you cannot be sure they mean it. The worst offenders are the Lib Dems, who will say anything they don't mean to get votes (tuition fees) and the Tories, who are being blown about in Ukip's wind. Labour, on the other hand, has some great policies that will appeal to the majority (keeping energy costs down, fair rents and tackling zero-hours contracts), but it backs off immediately they are attacked. They need to come out fighting and make it clear they will stick to their guns. To win a general election is a simple matter: set out your policies, defend them to the death and stick to them.<br /><strong>Malcolm Howard</strong><br /><em>Banstead, Surrey</em></p><p></p><p>• Ukip has explained it dismal electoral performance in the capital on the grounds that London is \"media-savvy\" and \"well-educated\". This says volumes about what Ukip really thinks about their voters. I think there's a stronger explanation why London proved resistant to Ukip's racist propaganda. London's glory is its diversity – 7 million people, 14 faiths and 300 languages – it's the most multicultural city in the world. In London, the abstract \"migrant\" and \"Romanian\", which Ukip tried to demonise and scapegoat have names and faces. They are neighbours and workmates, lovers and friends.</p><p>London's diversity, not its \"media savvy\" or the education of its citizens, inoculated it from Ukip's racist populism. London's rejection of the politics of hate gives hope for the future everywhere.<br /><strong>Sasha Simic</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>• On Friday morning I was exposed to MPs from the alleged major political parties saying that Ukip gains are a \"protest\" vote. How patronising is that? It assumes that voters do not have independent opinions nor actually think about who they are voting for. They just do not grasp what they are saying about themselves when they adopt these avoidance strategies. I voted for a \"marginal\" party for the first time and here are some reasons why: Conservatives cutting student nurse recruitment, while lying that they haven't but paying huge bonuses to senior managers at the same time; Labour refusing to state their position on EU membership nor providing credible opposition; as for the Liberal Democrats and their actions, there are too many u-turns and compromises to mention (tuition fees being possibly the first notable one) while they demonstrate utter self-delusion as to their actual importance.</p><p>Like many people I simply do not trust younger career politicians: talking to journalists with big, wide eyes, trying desperately to convince us of their integrity no longer works now we all know how corrupt many of them are. After the expenses scandal they no longer have the same status, nor do they deserve to: hypocrisy is not an endearing human trait. Their behaviour during PMQs says it all really – braying, name calling, not listening, avoiding answering questions. Such professionalism.<br /><strong>R Kimble</strong><br /><em>Leeds</em></p><p></p><p>• Polly Toynbee asks \"Why didn't people vote for at least modest reform in the alternative vote referendum three years ago?\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/dismal-eu-ballot-corrupt-electoral-system-safe-seats-rotten\" title=\"\">The British electoral system is corrupt – let's change it</a>, 23 May). She gives the answer: \"Mainly this was a case of voters wreaking revenge on what was a Lib Dem project.\"</p><p>She didn't go on to ask why Labour failed to promote this reform, nor did she ask why voters wanted vengeance so badly, despite thinking that first-past-the-post is unfair. Perhaps she didn't ask because it is she who stokes the flames of anti-coalition hatred so vigorously,  just as David Blunkett poured so much venomous bile on the possibility of a Labour-Lib Dem coalition back in 2010.</p><p>Had they been less consumed by enmity, we might by now have had four years of progressive government – and a less corrupt system of voting.<br /><strong>Peter Davis</strong><br /><em>Bath</em></p><p></p><p>• The national image of our political parties has become dominated by professional public relations people who insist that how they say the parties should present themselves is what will them win more support. If this were true, wouldn't our political parties be more popular now than ever? As Suzanne Moore tells us (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/21/never-mind-ukip-electorate-anger-alienated\" title=\"\">Never mind the threat of Ukip, the electorate has been consumed with anger and alienated for years</a>, G2, 22 May), it is the opposite. The PR people are just a bunch of snake oil salesmen with the most successful product they promote being themselves.</p><p>In the case of the Liberal Democrats, the PR people have insisted that the path to success is to banish all traces of the old \"beards and sandals\" local activist image, and to go on and on about being \"in government\". Every fall in the Liberal Democrat vote is then taken by them as a mark of their success because it is \"expected at this point in the electoral cycle for a governing party\".</p><p>The way the people voted in 2010, and the distortions of the electoral system the people backed by two-to-one in 2011, forced the Liberal Democrats to agree to a coalition which, with just one-sixth of its MPs, was bound to be dominated by the other party. The Liberal Democrats are not, then, \"in government\" in the conventional sense of the term, meaning in complete control of government policy. Their influence goes no more than to be able to swing the balance to the more liberal side of the Conservative party on issues where there is an even split in the Tories. We have a Tory government, and the four-year insistence of the PR people and the Lib Dem leadership that we must keep using words which imply it is a Lib Dem government is electoral suicide.</p><p>Every time Nick Clegg, and party president Tim Farron, who has been a great enthusiast for this line, use those words \"in government\" of the Liberal Democrats, they are telling Lib Dem voters, most of whom voted for the party because it was the local opposition to the Tories, that a Lib Dem government and a Tory government are the same thing. If the Liberal Democrats are to recover, all these people at the top must be got rid of and replaced by those who know how to win votes, even if they do sport beards and wear sandals.<br /><strong>Matthew Huntbach</strong><br /><em>London</em></p>","headline":"Ukip signals great chance for Labour","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> Where is the political anger about rising inequality in this country?

local elections have shown that voters like leaders who are perceived to stand up for what they believe in","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T01:51:12Z","body":"<p>Yesterday's local and European elections bore all the hallmarks of a dress rehearsal for next year's general election. So what do they tell us about how ready Labour is for opening night in May 2015?</p><p>Estimates by politics professor John Curtice put the party's share of the vote up three percentage points on 2010 to 30%, but down from 38% two years ago. As he argued this morning: \"If a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections – even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time. The truth is, by that test at least, Labour has not done well enough.\"</p><p>In the face of the Tories' ability to outspend it, one of Labour's great strengths is its volunteer army, which – as it did in 2010, when organisational effort allowed the party to win a 1992 share of the parliament on a 1983 share of the vote – played a key role in its advances yesterday. But the elections also underlined three weaknesses that it must now seek to address.</p><p>First, the election campaign saw a positive tsunami of new announcements from Labour: on increasing the minimum wage, capping rent increases, and giving people the right to see their GP within 48 hours. Each of these policies is undoubtedly popular. A <a href=\"http://www.comres.co.uk/poll/1182/independent-political-poll.htm\" title=\"\">ComRes poll shortly before the elections</a>, for instance, found that 32% of people said Labour's policies for government such as freezing energy prices and increasing the top rate of tax made them more likely to vote for the party.</p><p>However, popular policies alone are not sufficient to guarantee electoral victory. As <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/02/03/why-labours-popular-tax-policy-backfired/\" title=\"\">Peter Kellner of YouGov has suggested</a>, \"history offers plenty of examples of the dangers of interpreting the public mood too simplistically\". In 1992, Neil Kinnock took the supposedly popular policies of higher child benefit and state pensions funded by an increase in national insurance contributions on the better-off to the electorate and was buried by John Major. Similarly, policies on crime, immigration and Europe, which scored well in the polls, did nothing to save William Hague in 2001 or Michael Howard in 2005. The Tories' chances then were sunk by its lingering \"nasty party\" image. Labour's problem is somewhat different. As in 1992, its failure to <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/04/22/labour-loses-ground-economy/\" title=\"\">convince the electorate that it can be trusted with the economy</a> undermines much else it tries to do.</p><p>Second, the elections highlighted the limit to Labour's focus on the cost of living crisis. As wage increases begin to outstrip prices there is a question mark over whether this campaign will reach its sell-by date before May 2015. However, the proceeds of the recovery are not yet being felt by all and the Tories have shown scant interest in ensuring they do. This presents an opportunity for Ed Miliband, but to seize it Labour needs to develop an agenda focused on future prosperity: one that is as much about growing the overall size of the cake as it is about sharing it out more fairly.</p><p>Third, some of Nigel Farage's comments during the campaign – about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/may/21/romanian-nigel-farage-westerham-kent-neighbour-video\" title=\"\">undesirability of having Romanians as neighbours</a>, for instance – reeked of 1960s Powellism. While there were some honourable exceptions, Labour's leadership appeared strangely unwilling to call out Farage's racism and tackle head-on the lies about Europe and migration that Ukip has been allowed to peddle for too long.</p><p>There are legitimate concerns about immigration – principally the exploitation of migrants and the impact on low-paid Britons – which need to be addressed (and, to his credit, Miliband has focused much attention here). And there is a rich agenda around reform of the EU which supporters of Britain's membership need to do more to advance. But basic principles – that migration benefits Britain socially, culturally and economically and that to cut ourselves off from the world's largest single market would be an act of absolute folly – must be defended vigorously.</p><p>Labour not only lags the Tories on economic competence, it also lags on leadership. There is still time for Labour to address both. Miliband has previously indicated his desire to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/16/ed-miliband-labour-margaret-thatcher\" title=\"\">reshape the landscape of British politics in the manner of Margaret Thatcher</a>. She was, in part, able to do this because voters respected the fact that she stood up for what she believed in, even when they disagreed vehemently with those beliefs. Workshops conducted by <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2013/12/01/meet-the-swing-voters/\" title=\"\">BritainThinks for the Labour pressure group Progress in four key marginal constituencies</a> last autumn found a desire and willingness to hear hard truths, even unpopular ones, from the party. A staunch defence of both immigration and Europe by Miliband might fly in the face of public opinion, but in so doing it may give the Labour leader's ratings just the fillip he needs.</p><p>Miliband will receive much advice in the light of the results from David Axelrod, who helped steer President Obama to two landslide victories in America. But perhaps fictional American political drama has something to offer too. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Bartlet_Be_Bartlet\" title=\"\">\"Let Bartlet be Bartlet\"</a>, suggests a staffer in The West Wing. On immigration and Europe we all know where Miliband's instincts and values would lead him. Someone needs to tell him they may make good politics too.</p>","headline":"Popular policies alone are not enough – Miliband must win voters' respect","trailText":"<strong>Robert Philpot: </strong>The

A pity – they might learn something.</p><p>Actually, we know what Blair would do because he has already done it. He would largely ignore the European issue as presented by Ukip itself. All polls confirm that it is low on the list of most voter concerns compared with bread-and-butter problems such as rewarding jobs or the state of the NHS. Europe is shorthand for alienation from the political process and dismay at the pace of change in our globalised world – including immigration, carelessly handled by Blair's complacent government.</p><p>As Tory leader in 2001 William Hague, a true child of Margaret Thatcher, decided to run his election campaign on xenophobic themes – Britain as \"a foreign land\" and the like. Blair ignored it. Watching Labour candidates defending marginal seats that year in Kent, exposed as it is to some downsides of immigration, I heard voters complaining about jobs, schools and the poor state of some local hospitals, not about \"saving the pound\". New Labour creamed Hague (and Gordon Brown saved the pound).</p><p>That does not mean Blair or his team would ignore Farage completely. When the Ukip leader slips up the old pro would be on him like a tiger. Vladimir Putin as an admired international statesman? Both Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage, Little Britain nationalists (different bits of Britain), have expressed respect for Putin's reassertion of Russian national pride. So have other rightwing populists across Europe (Salmond's genius is to be both right and left). It is a mistake Blair would have hammered.</p><p>Putin runs a lawless, authoritarian state, overdependent on oil and gas, heading the wrong way in the modern world. You can hear Blair saying it, can't you? Cheeky chappie that he is, he might even add that, for all its woes, post-war Iraq is struggling not to do the same – in the face of religious fundamentalism and thin-skinned nationalism.</p><p>As a matter of fact, largely forgotten, Blair and Farage have clashed directly.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT--RnOYORI\">Reading on mobile? Link to video of Farage v Blair in 2005</a></p><p>It happened at the Strasbourg parliament in 2005 after Blair cut a compromise deal on Britain's EU rebate – Maggie's famous handbag rebate in Tory-speak. He did so in return for reform of the bloated agricultural budget (it's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11216061\" title=\"\">happening, though painfully slowly</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT--RnOYORI\" title=\"\">Farage complained</a> that he had been completely outclassed (\"game, set and match\") by President Jacques Chirac of France, this in the year – irony alert – that Chirac won the 2012 Olympics bid for Paris.</p><p>Watch that clip again. For once Farage turns up and fights his corner. It can't have been easy in a hostile setting like that. Good for Nigel. You may think he came out of the exchange best. What is not in dispute is that Blair had a coherent answer which sounds like a man doing a man's job instead of pandering to Ukippery as David Cameron does.</p><p>He did it to win the Tory leadership in 2005 (he foolishly promised to leave the conservative group in Strasbourg and did) and has done again too often since. Fat good it has done Cameron since every concession leads to more \"transitional demands\" – as the left comrades would put it. The anti-EU camp and its backers in the oligarch press want us out. Not since they helped force a vengeful peace at Versailles in 1918 have they done such harm to British interests (unless you count pre-war appeasement in 1938).</p><p>Here's what Blair told Farage. For all the feebleness and folly of EU leadership since then, for all Blair's own greedy excess, it remains the correct answer:</p><blockquote><p>Let me just tell you, sir, and your colleagues: you sit with our country's flag; you do not represent our country's interests. This is the year: 2005, not 1945. We're not fighting each other any more. These are our partners. They're our colleagues and our future lies in Europe. And when you and your colleagues say: 'What do we get in return for what we contribute to enlargement?', I'll tell you what we get. We get a Europe that is unified after years of dictatorship in the east. We get economic development in countries whom we have championed. We get a future reform that allows us – once and for all – to put an end to discussion about rebates, common agricultural policy, and get a proper budget for Europe. That's what we get if we have the vision to seize that opportunity.</p></blockquote><p>Of course by 2005, Blair, though re-elected for a third time, was mired in the legacy of the bloody Anglo-American occupation of Iraq, and much enfeebled at home by his own civil war with Brown. Unwisely persuaded by Jack Straw, he had promised a referendum on the EU constitution which the French and – of all people – the saintly Dutch torpedoed on his behalf when they voted it down.</p><p>Never glad confident morning again for Blair or the EU, which staggers on preoccupied with its internal economic problems, overextended and unable to say boo to the Faragiste pin-up in the Kremlin as he unleashes forces he may not be able to control in Ukraine.</p><p>Love him or hate him, do we really think Blair, the wannabe global plutocrat with a flair for elective politics, would not have made a better fist of coordinating EU policy if he, not Herman Van Thingy, had been in charge? Or a better fist of sticking it to good old Nigel? Go on, admit it, you know he would have been better.</p>","headline":"Faced with Nigel Farage, what would Tony Blair do?","trailText":"<p>Admit it – Labour's triple election winner would have known how to handle the threat from the Ukip leader</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"8","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400852534540/Tony-Blair-006.jpg","wordcount":"957","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"437645403","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9080703","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Michael White","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2098002","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-30T13:52:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/faced-nigel-farage-tony-blair","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/faced-nigel-farage-tony-blair","tags":[{"id":"politics/tonyblair","webTitle":"Tony Blair","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/tonyblair","references":[]},{"id":"politics/nigel-farage","webTitle":"Nigel Farage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/nigel-farage","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/blog","webTitle":"Politics blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on politics, politicians and political news","type":"blog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelwhite","webTitle":"Michael White","rcsId":"GNL004718","r2ContributorId":"16139","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336544/MichaelWhite.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733744420/MichaelWhite.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael White is assistant editor and has been writing for the Guardian for more than 30 years, as a reporter, foreign correspondent and columnist.

Even before the latest election results have been fully digested, the three main parties have launched new attempts to win back the 4.3 million Britons who voted for Nigel Farage in the European elections. The Conservatives are turning up the volume on their promise of a EU referendum and hostility to immigration, hoping this will be enough to convince a sufficient number of Ukippers to return to the fold by 2015. While some in Labour also advocate tough talk on immigration,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/labour-ukip-anti-immigrant-vote-ed-miliband-election\" title=\"\"> Ed Miliband has charted a different course</a>; he wants to reconnect with Ukip's left-behind voters but sees little point in trying to out-Ukip the party. And Farage faces his own challenge: how to retain his new voters who after every previous set of European elections swiftly abandoned Ukip.</p><p>But to what extent will Ukip's revolt crash and burn before 2015 and what messages are there for the main parties? We can gain unique insight by looking at the latest wave of the <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/\" title=\"\">British Election Study</a>, a key resource for academics who study elections.</p><p>Let's first consider the widespread assumption that Ukip is about to collapse. As shown below, the reality is more complex. Ukip will certainly lose some support; 36% of those who voted Ukip in the European elections are already planning to abandon the party in 2015. Of these defectors the largest number (25%) will switch to the Conservatives, 8% will vote Labour and 3% for another party. So there is evidence of an exodus from Ukip to the Conservatives, but the figure is far lower than Conservatives would like. In fact almost two-thirds (64%) of Ukip's European election voters plan to stay loyal in 2015. If we include Ukip voters who are undecided about who to support in 2015 then this figure drops to less than 60% – but the message is clear: Ukip will have a stronger base heading into 2015 than at any previous election.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438093388'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401381014404/Ukip-bar-chart-1-004.jpg' alt='Ukip bar chart 1' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ukip voters' intentions as a percentage.</figcaption></figure><p>So who are these Ukip loyalists? First, they are more likely to be women. Ukip struggles to win over women, but when it does, they are more likely to stay loyal. We are not sure why this is, but one implication is that Farage's strategy of promoting women as candidates and spokeswomen might help him retain support. It also suggests that the selection of the older, white male, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/06/roger-helmer-selected-as-ukip-candidate-for-newark-byelection\" title=\"\">Roger Helmer, as its candidate in Newark</a> is a lost opportunity for Ukip. Second, Farage's shift to northern areas is paying off; the most loyal Ukip voters are found in the north-east and north-west where 70% plan to stay loyal (compared with less than 60% in Scotland).</p><p>Third, while Ukip voters in general are disadvantaged, its loyalists are the most left behind. Those planning to stay loyal are the most likely to have no qualifications and the lowest incomes, while those who will leave Farage in 2015 have more skills and income (though remain less well-off than most voters). How can Farage ensure his disadvantaged loyalists turn out, and how can the main parties target these two groups? These are the key questions in 2015.</p><p>Finally, how do the outlooks of these two groups compare? This is where the picture gets really interesting. Those who plan to leave Ukip are significantly more concerned than the loyalists about the economy. The most plausible explanation is that they are being won back by perceptions of Conservative party competence in running the economy and that Ukip is not a safe pair of hands. But remember that defectors are a smaller group, while the more numerous loyalists are animated by a very different issue.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438093389'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401381193691/Ukip-bar-chart-2-004.jpg' alt='Ukip bar chart 2' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Ukip's loyalists are concerned less about the economy than immigration; 73% of them see immigration as the main problem facing Britain but only 27% of defectors think so. Ukip is only likely to retain around half of its supporters who feel that the economy is the most pressing issue, but stands a much greater chance of sustaining its core, disadvantaged base who feel far more strongly about immigration. This suggests that Farage's shift to immigration will help him inflict damage in 2015, but only so long as the issue remains important in the minds of his core voters. For Labour and the Conservatives, the message is clear: the more they focus on immigration, the more they risk heightening its importance among left-behind voters, and the greater the chance that Farage will lock them into his revolt until 2015.</p>","headline":"The battle is on to poach Ukip's voters – but they're a loyal bunch","trailText":"<p><strong>Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo: Ukip matters: </strong>Don't bank on a collapse in support for Nigel Farage and co between now and 2015, despite Labour and Tory siren calls</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401376160716/Ukip-struggles-to-win-ove-006.jpg","wordcount":"737","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"438082997","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9102591","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo","internalPageCode":"2101051","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-01T16:45:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/ukip-voters-loyal-nigel-farage-2015-labour-tory","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/ukip-voters-loyal-nigel-farage-2015-labour-tory","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","webTitle":"Ukip matters","description":"A regular look at Ukip and the political divides emerging as Britain moves towards the 2015 general election, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthew-goodwin\">Matthew Goodwin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/caitlin-milazzo\">Caitlin Milazzo</a>","type":"series","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","references":[]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/matthew-goodwin","webTitle":"Matthew Goodwin","r2ContributorId":"30580","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/19/1345392425163/Matthew-Goodwin.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Matthew Goodwin is associate professor at the University of Nottingham whose latest book Revolt on the Right: Explaining Public Support for the Radical Right in Britain is published by Routledge.

His point concerning London's \"difference\" is interesting but partial. A review of council seats gained, lost and held across much of England reveals a much more complex, less London-centric, picture.</p><p>In the major cities and large towns across England, it is clear that with only one major exception Ukip failed. Not one of the following councils returned a single Ukip candidate: Birmingham, Coventry, Exeter, Ipswich, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Norwich, Preston, Southampton, Stockport, Sunderland. Ukip holds one seat in each of Bradford, Bristol and Wolverhampton, three in Plymouth and Sheffield and, here's the major exception, six out of 42 in Portsmouth.</p><p>Of course, the failure to capture seats on these councils does not mean that Ukip is absent; the party clearly has support. However, it begs the question of why Ukip is so strong in other areas such as Adur, Basildon, Cannock Chase, Dudley, Great Yarmouth, Kirklees, Newcastle-under-Lyme, North East Lincolnshire, Rotherham, Southend-on-Sea, Thurrock and the Wyre Forest. Taken together, Ukip has 89 seats in these councils. That is more than half of its entire holding.</p><p>At first glance these places do not have a lot in common. First glances, however, are not enough. My guess is that poverty and unemployment will be found to be two major underlying reasons why people have abandoned the three established parties. It will be interesting and important to see how these reasons and others are refracted through the prism of national identity and individualism set in place by Mrs Thatcher 35 years ago.<br /><strong>Derek Mckiernan</strong><br /><em>Leeds</em></p><p>• Despite Zoe Williams' excellent article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/green-party-support-media-ukip\" title=\"\">Support for the Greens is surging – haven't you heard?</a>, 21 May) pointing up the Green party's invisibility in the media commentary leading up to the election, the Guardian and the rest of the media have continued to ignore the Greens and to present an extraordinary counterfactual account of the local election results. Ukip's share of the poll actually fell from 23% last year to 17% this year and it is the Conservative seats that have suffered most at their hands. The aggregation of voting into London and the rest ignores major variations throughout the country: Havering elected their seven existing Ukip councillors while Liverpool, Manchester and Preston elected none. The north-east similarly ignored Ukip.</p><p>It would be hard to discover in the coverage that Labour took over half the council seats up for election and gained control of five councils while Ukip gained none and its 160 seats are so scattered they will have very little power, especially as they are mainly complete political newcomers with no knowledge of how to be most effective as the only Ukip representative. Will we see a Ukip member joining the non-aligned group and working with a Green? It was very difficult to discover that the Green party had 20 seats before the election, of those seats being contested this year. We won 23 more seats with almost no press coverage. The Greens now have 162 councillors on 56 councils, including six in Bristol, six in Oxford, 15 in Norwich and 10 in Solihull. Is none of that even worthy of a brief footnote.<br /><strong>Ruth Funnell</strong><br /><em>Great Torrington, Devon</em></p><p></p><p>• Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/editorial-local-elections-small-earthquake-england\" title=\"\">24 May</a>) states Ukip support is strong in the east of England. The BBC's Nick Robinson has also invented a myth that \"Essex man has gone Ukip\". Following the local election results you published on the same day, this is hard to justify. In Colchester, not a single Ukip councillor was elected. In other cities in the east, in Cambridge, Norwich and Ipswich, the latter having long been as cosmopolitan as London, again Mr Farage has failed. I suggest Ukip flourishes only on the fringes of the region. This is often in declining seaside resorts where retired people have been persuaded Bulgarians are out to snatch their pensions.<br /><strong>Michael Munt</strong><br /><em>Bredfield, Suffolk</em></p><p></p><p>• Another local election staggers past the finishing post. Thanks to voter apathy and demographic chance, the winning party in my borough has a dictatorial majority of 59 out of 63 seats, based on the votes of less than one in six of the electorate. Ukip's share of the vote has gone down from 23% to 17% nationally, and yet they have gained 128 more council seats. Will this finally persuade the major parties to accept a fairer voting system (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/dismal-eu-ballot-corrupt-electoral-system-safe-seats-rotten\" title=\"\">The British electoral system is corrupt – let's change it</a>, 23 May)? If we don't find a better way soon of making elections mean something to more people, we may as well outsource all the decisions to Serco.<br /><strong>Pauline Gaunt</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p>• I was appalled to read (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ed-miliband-labour-ukip-change\" title=\"\">Miliband told: raise your game</a>, 24 May) that there is anger in the Labour party \"that Miliband focused too much on policy rather than projecting an empathy with voters' sense of alienation from the political class\". To my mind, one of the major reasons that the public feels alienated from politicians is that we are treated by the likes of David Cameron and Nigel Farage as mindless idiots who can only absorb one idea at a time, and at that one designed to appeal to unnecessary xenophobia stirred up by the media. I would like our politicians to explain more about their policies on all subjects, not less.<br /><strong>Wendy Churchman</strong><br /><em>Birmingham</em></p><p></p><p>• In 1956, Pierre Poujade, a French demagogue whose declared aim was to defend the \"common man\" against the French establishment and fight any foreign influences that might alter the French traditional way of life, got elected to the Assemblée Nationale together with the leader of his party's youth branch, a jeune-homme called Jean-Marie Le Pen. Two years later, Poujade's party, the Union de Défense de Commerçants et Artisans, faded into oblivion. I wonder why I suddenly remembered all this.<br /><strong>Eduardo de Benito</strong><br /><em>Cley next the Sea, Norfolk</em></p><p></p><p>• Marina Hyde is right (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/apathetic-general-election-none-of-the-above\" title=\"\">Come my revolution, the apathetic will get their say</a>, 24 May). People who don't support any of the candidates on their ballot forms need a \"none of the above\" option. That is why I started <a href=\"https://notabradford.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">NOTA – None of the Above</a>, a campaign registered with the Electoral Commission to encourage voters to write those words on the ballot. She is right, too, to say people are resistant to spoiling their ballot in this way. That was the feedback we received when we leafleted the People's Assembly in March, which is why we are supporting the online petition to include this option in all future elections.</p><p>Signatures may be placed at <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/51127\" title=\"\">epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/51127</a>.
