Do you remember when it was a sign of being really fond of someone, knowing their phone number off by heart? Now you have to be kind to them and stuff. </strong>Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, and you had to dial numbers on an actual dial, remember? Round it went, thrrrrrrr-up, then tickatickaticka … Calling people with too many 0s and 9s in their number used to take for ever and be really annoying!</strong> Halcyon days. Not everyone is so nostalgic about them, though.</p> <p><strong>Oh, really? Who could possibly have a different opinion?</strong> Facebook.</p> <p><strong>The gigantic website owned by that billionaire child and full of all the annoying people whose phone numbers I can’t remember? </strong>That’s right. Or Facebook’s Messenger app, anyway. The site has made its 2016 trend predictions, and top of the list is “<a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/01/heres-to-2016-with-messenger/\" title=\"\">the disappearance of the phone number</a>”.</p> <p><strong>Eh? Why would phone numbers disappear this year? Other than because Facebook wants them to? </strong>“Just like the flip phone is disappearing, old communication styles are disappearing, too,” says David Marcus, VP of messaging products. “With Messenger, we offer all the things that made texting so popular, but also so much more … You can make video and voice calls while at the same time not needing to know someone’s phone number.”</p> <p><strong>But I do that already. My phone remembers it for me.</strong> What if you want to call someone whose number you don’t know?</p> <p><strong>I look it up, or they tell me. </strong>Ah, but imagine if you could use their email address or other contact details instead.</p> <p><strong>What if I didn’t know their email address or other contact details? </strong>You’d look it up, or they’d tell you.</p> <p><strong>That doesn’t sound like a radical step forward. I mean, maybe landlines will disappear and everything will converge eventually, but it’s ridiculous to predict it for this year. What else do they say will happen?</strong> “Threads are the new apps … We’re all social beings … Innovation matters … It’s all about delight …”</p> <p><strong>Is that just gibberish or do they give some kind of explanation?</strong> “We’re seeing a paradigm shift in how people engage,” it starts …</p> <p><strong>Let’s make it stop there, too. </strong>With pleasure.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Facebook is the new astrology.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “It’s all about cash.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11143545","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2435646","internalRevision":"59","publication":"The

It’s being marketed as a way for women to communicate like men in the workplace.</p> <p><strong>Do they need that?</strong> There is a sense – and patchy formal linguistic evidence – that women use more circumlocutions, self-negating words and diffident phrasings in speech and writing that can lead others to misperceive what is being asked or required of them.</p> <p><strong>But what if you are sorry about something? </strong>Then you may ignore the red underline.</p> <p><strong>Can women do that?

Well done.</p> <p><strong>OK then – how about: what if suddenly leaping eight rungs up the authoritarian ladder induces more hostility than respect? </strong>How so?</p> <p><strong>Well, language is a delicate dance, innit?

Humphries: tactless bigot or another satirical creation?","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-05T14:48:45Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Barry Humphries.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 81.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>The hilarious, ironically offensive alter ego of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/dame-edna-everage\" title=\"\">Dame Edna Everage</a>.</p> <p><strong>Are you sure you’ve got that the right way round?</strong> Pretty sure, yes. Dame Edna is the performer, and Barry Humphries is her wildly overcooked caricature of spluttering rightwing outrage.</p> <p><strong>I don’t think that’s right.</strong> Of course it’s right. Haven’t you read the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/barry-humphries-caitlyn-jenner-is-a-publicity-seeking-ratbag/\" title=\"\">interviews to promote his new radio show</a>? They’re a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/borat\" title=\"\">Borat</a>-level masterclass of sustained satire, skewering the backwards attitudes of conservative blowhards who spend their lives railing against the perceived threat of political correctness. It’s tremendous.</p> <p><strong>Really? What did he say?</strong> He called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner\" title=\"\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> a “mutilated man” and a “publicity-seeking ratbag” for starters. Brilliant.</p> <p><strong>OK, what else?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/05/barry-humphries-bbc-cameron-corbyn-edna-everage\" title=\"\">He asked the Radio Times</a>, “Why do you think Downton Abbey is so popular in the States?” before answering: “Because there are no black people in it.” Take that, conservatives!</p> <p><strong>Is that everything? </strong>He has also hilariously dismantled the idea of BBC bias by claiming that an unnamed producer asked him to balance out jokes about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> in a recent routine by adding jokes about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a>.</p> <p><strong>Are you sure these aren’t just his own personal views?</strong> Oh, hardly. Dame Edna is one of the most perfect creations ever to spike the trend of empty celebrity. This new Barry Humphries character is simply doing the same thing, but aiming his laser at the outdated beliefs of tedious old men.</p> <p><strong>Last time I’ll ask: are you absolutely positive that this is a gag, and not just the desperate ravings of someone who’s clearly losing touch with the world?</strong> Absolutely. After all, he spoke about a Nazi friend of his, whose dying words were: “Zat Barry Humphries, ze Führer would have adored him.” You don’t invoke Hitler’s name in a funny accent to praise your own work unless it’s a joke, right?</p> <p><strong>Um … </strong>Oh God, did he mean it? Was Barry Humphries being sincere? Is he really proud that Hitler would have liked his comedy?</p> <p><strong>Look, there’s a chance.</strong> And the Caitlyn Jenner thing? Holy christ! The man’s a monster!</p> <p><strong>Unless he was joking.</strong> Oh God! I’m so confused!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Everyone is entitled to their opinions.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Unless those opinions are awful and demonstrably wrong.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11131215","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-01-06T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2433334","internalRevision":"32","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Dame Edna Everage’s hilariously offensive alter ego is back with an overcooked caricature of rightwing outrage.

Tunnock's</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Are we talking about Scotland’s most iconic biscuit maker? </strong>That depends how you assess the competing claims of, among others, Walkers shortbread and McVitie’s.</p> <p><strong>I’m going to pretend you said yes. </strong>Fine.</p> <p><strong>So, what has Tunnock’s done?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/tunnock-s-drop-iconic-lion-branding-to-be-more-british-1-3990374\">Dropped the Scottish symbol of a lion rampant</a> from its logo for a new teacake advert on London Underground.</p> <p><strong>Is this to appease its English overlords?</strong> Essentially. It’s complicated, though: there has always been a version of the logo without the lion, and the lion appears on the pack shot in the corner. However, the ad carries the headline “The Great British Teacake”, which is a provocative phrase.</p> <p><strong>How so? </strong>Britishness doesn’t appeal to a large minority of Scots, who nearly rejected it in 2014.</p> <p><strong>Maybe it’s best to stay away from emotive nationalism when you’re selling biscuits?</strong> Maybe. But it isn’t easy. Company patriarch Boyd Tunnock says his son-in-law Fergus Loudon, who came up with the campaign, only meant to riff on the success of the Great British Bake Off. He also says that many English people don’t even realise that Tunnock’s is Scottish.</p> <p><strong>Those English! They don’t deserve to have Scotland stuck to them. </strong>However … Tunnock’s also admitted that it won’t use “Great British” in Scotland. “We’d just say teacakes.”</p> <p><strong>“Tunnock’s. The Teacakes”? </strong>I suppose so. At this point, it may be worth noting that Boyd Tunnock is a prominent and longstanding supporter of Scotland’s union with England.</p> <p><strong>I’m confused. Is this deliberate biscuit agitprop or isn’t it?</strong> Who knows. Politics is everywhere in biscuits. When <a href=\"http://www.cyansub.com/tunnocks\">the design agency Super Cyan Submarine</a> was making brochures to promote Tunnock’s in China, it had to take great pains to avoid any reference to that country’s past oppression by Japan.</p> <p><strong>What? </strong>“The worry [was] that the Tunnock’s teacake design could be confused with the very stereotypical rising sun emblem of Japan, due to the red and white striped graphics. We had to be extremely conscientious and considerate of this concern throughout the design process.”</p> <p><strong>Oh good grief. </strong>I said it wasn’t easy.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Do KitKats think we should renew the Trident nuclear missile programme?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I don’t know, but Penguins definitely want faster action on climate change.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11128928","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2432785","internalRevision":"45","publication":"The

don’t know?</p> <p><strong>I had a pretty big 2014 and I’ve been detoxing in bed ever since. Were there awful disasters and atrocities? </strong>I’m afraid so. Especially an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/may/12/nepal-earthquake-74-tremor-hits-near-mount-everest-live-updates\">earthquake in Nepal</a> that everyone has forgotten about.</p> <p><strong>I’m sorry to hear that.

Who else had a good year? </strong>Tories.</p> <p><strong>Also sad. Did they somehow form another coalition? </strong>Nope. They won an outright majority then watched Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\">elect Jeremy Corbyn as their new leader</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who?</strong> Jeremy Corbyn. He’s a lefty from the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>Wait, but … I mean how did … </strong>No one really knows what happened, OK? Ed Miliband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/the-ed-stones-fate-resting-in-peace-in-a-south-london-garage\">just turned up one day with a giant gravestone</a>, then lost, then everything went crazy, and at the end Corbyn was doing prime minister’s questions.</p> <p><strong>Blimey. What else did I miss? </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras\">Greece finally defaulted on its debt</a>.</p> <p><strong>So are they out of the euro now?

mistletoe.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> About 150 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Increasingly rare.</p> <p><strong>Don’t tell me. Because of climate change? No mistletoe, plus everyone is too paralysed with fear of the impending apocalypse to want to get the snogs in.</strong> For once, no. Nowt to do with terrifying, unseasonally warm weather and its intimations of doom.</p> <p><strong>What’s happening, then?</strong> A new survey by the impeccably qualified and unimpeachable team of researchers at Morrisons supermarket – which is in no way manufacturing a story that then allows it to give away sprigs of mistletoe to customers as a sales gimmick, as they happen to be doing at the moment – says that while 62% of over-55s have been kissed under the mistletoe at Christmas, 75% of people under 35 have not.</p> <p><strong>They have in my office. I sprayed on extra Lynx and made sure of it.</strong> Yeeesss … you see, this is part of the problem.</p> <p><strong>What is?</strong> The tradition that says any woman standing under mistletoe can be kissed –</p> <p><strong>And will be dogged by bad luck if she refuses. Don’t forget that part. I never do. It will seal the deal.</strong> You are a delight. Yes, there’s that part too – but it all sits increasingly uncomfortably with modern mores.</p> <p><strong>Which are?</strong> That women get quite enough unwanted kisses in life without the encouragement of Victorian traditions and viscum album.</p> <p><strong>Now wait – no one said anything about introducing viscum album into the proceedings. Even I wouldn’t go that far. </strong>No, that’s the proper name for mistletoe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/07/mistletoe-vanish-20-years-national-trust\">Mistletoe could vanish within 20 years, says National Trust</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Thank God. So, what’s to be done?</strong> Well, mistletoe sales have been declining for the past 20 years, but growers say 2015 has yielded a bumper-berried crop.

You people must live like animals. </strong>No, I’m talking about the last day of the parliamentary year.</p> <p><strong>Oh, so when all the politicians leave the building – that’s like taking out the trash, except it walks out by itself? I get it. It doesn’t really work, but I get it. </strong>No, again – it’s the day when they release lots of bad news in the hope that, in the Christmas rush, there will be fewer MPs and journalists around to scrutinise it and fewer media outlets willing to kill the festive buzz by publishing it.</p> <p><strong>Ah, I see. An ultra-good day to bury ultra-bad news, you mean? </strong>Exactly.</p> <p><strong>How much bad news has the government got left?

<p><strong>Age: </strong>170.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Two bits of concrete and a picket fence.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, sounds nice. But I’ve never heard of Shippea Hill.</strong> Don’t worry, nobody has. Shippea Hill has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35105105\">just been named as Great Britain’s quietest train station</a>.</p> <p><strong>How quiet are we talking? </strong>There were only 22 passenger entries and exits in the whole of 2014. That’s less than one a fortnight.</p> <p><strong>That is quite quiet. </strong>Are you kidding? Compared with 2013, when there were only 12 entries and exits, it’s a throbbing metropolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/comment.transport\">David McKie: Ghost trains to Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>It sounds great! How do I get there? </strong>Travel to Cambridge, then change on to the Abellio Greater Anglia service to Norwich. Shippea Hill is two stops in.</p> <p><strong>That sounds easy enough.</strong> One caveat, though. There’s only one service a day, and if you were travelling from the capital you would need to be on the 5.43am train out of London to get there.</p> <p><strong>I can probably manage that.</strong> Also, trains out of Shippea Hill are so infrequent that you would be stuck there until half past seven the following morning.</p> <p><strong>Fine, I’ll soak up some of the nightlife. What’s around?</strong> Well the charming cathedral city of Ely, the nearest conurbation of note, is a quick two-and-a-half hour walk away, so there’s that. Plus you get to pass a village called Prickwillow on the way. Instagram will love that.</p> <p><strong>Walk? Why can’t I drive there?</strong> Because the Shippea Hill station car park was sold off when British Rail went private in the 1990s. You could always try sleeping in the nearby Wings hostel instead.</p> <p><strong>That sounds nice.</strong> I’m not sure. Judging by Google Maps, the hostel is just a load of portable buildings. It has received only one Google review, a description-free missive from a man named Piotr six months ago. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Wings+Hostel+shippea+hill&amp;lrd=0x47d83e1902417c95:0xa589bad76084d575,1\">He gave it one star</a>.</p> <p><strong>So if Shippea Hill is the quietest station in the country, what’s the busiest?</strong> London Waterloo, which had 99m passenger entries and exits last year.</p> <p><strong>Jesus, no thanks. I’d rather try my luck with Shippea Hill.</strong> Me, too. See you there in a fortnight.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Come to Shippea Hill for the sprawling fields and huge skies.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Stay for the eight-hour walk to the nearest Pret.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11083721","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2425339","internalRevision":"51","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"There’s a picket fence, a nearby hostel and a village that’s ripe for Instagramming.

</strong>Once a year.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> All of them.</p> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Well, obviously, this time it’s a Wednesday, but what’s so special about it?</strong> It’s the 350th day of most years. It was the date of the Boston Tea Party in 1773. It’s also, apparently, the worst day of the year to have a birthday*.</p> <p><strong>What’s all this* business*? </strong>What? Oh, it’s just my way of saying there are a few provisos.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, I love a good proviso. Like what?</strong> Well, one thing that makes it a bad birthday is that the days are dark and cold.</p> <p><strong>So, if you like being cosy indoors, or you live in the southern hemisphere or the tropics, then it’s OK?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>What else? </strong>The main problem with 16 December, according to researchers*, is that it’s very close to Christmas, which means people are too busy with other parties to bother with yours. You also get “combined presents”. Worse still, your present may be wrapped in Christmas paper.</p> <p><strong>That’s a disgrace.</strong> Although, obviously, if you don’t celebrate Christmas or live in a Christian country, it’s largely irrelevant.</p> <p><strong>Yes. And even if you agree that it’s bad to have a birthday close to Christmas, why is 16 December worst of all? What about the 17 days that are closer still? </strong>The study* doesn’t say. It was done by an <a href=\"http://www.interflora.co.uk/content/how-good-is-your-birthday\" title=\"\">attention-seeking flower company</a> that got its results by gathering data from 2,000 people who told it how many birthday presents they got, how many people came to their parties and so on.</p> <p><strong>Two thousand people? So each day’s data is based on an average of five?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>And natural variation means that some days probably only have data from one or two people, if any? </strong>Yes.</p> <p><strong>Who actually has a birthday on 16 December? A bunch of losers? </strong>Not unless you think that describes Jane Austen (1775), Wassily Kandinsky (1866), Noël Coward (1899), Arthur C Clarke (1917), Philip K Dick (1928), Quentin Blake (1932), Christopher Biggins (1948) and Bill Hicks (1961).</p> <p><strong>There’s no arguing with a list like that.</strong> Every one a heavy-hitter.</p> <p><strong>So, people can still enjoy 16 December birthdays? </strong>Probably … I did say it was a study*.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>Happy birthday!</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>Prove it!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11080543","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2424606","internalRevision":"46","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Born nine days before Christmas?

deadly.</p> <p><strong>You mean because they make you fall over? </strong>Nope. I mean because they’re a weapon.</p> <p><strong>Ah, you mean an erotic weapon in the war of the sexes. </strong>Nope. I mean because you can stab people in the head with them.</p> <p><strong>Can I? </strong>With training, certainly. A Canadian self-defence instructor called <a href=\"http://www.soteriamethod.com\" title=\"\">Avital Zeisler</a> has designed a strategy for women who are attacked while they’re wearing heels, and <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1644466.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2015_12_12\" title=\"\">the Sunday Times reports</a> she plans to bring her classes to the UK next year. “I love to wear high heels,” she says. “I wasn’t going to let self-defence compromise the quality of my life or my femininity.”</p> <p><strong>Some might say high heels already compromise her quality of life by increasing the risk of chronic foot, calf and back problems. </strong>They shouldn’t say it to her face. Zeisler is a former dancer who trained in the Israeli martial art of krav maga.</p> <p><strong>So what does she say a woman, or indeed a man, should do if attacked in their heels? </strong>Option one: take them off and run away.</p> <p><strong>Sounds good. I’ll go with that. </strong>You might not have time. In which case there’s option two: run away while wearing them.</p> <p><strong>Tricky.</strong> But doable. You need to practise running on the balls of your feet only. Zeisler can sprint on a treadmill in very high heels.</p> <p><strong>What’s option three?</strong> Fight while wearing them. Lying down, they’re actually an advantage because you can perform a “defensive push-kick” with the point.</p> <p><strong>What’s a defensive push-kick?</strong> Think of it like stamping upwards “into the targets that are available”, Heisler explains in her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bSNkwLxHUY\" title=\"\">instructional video</a>. “Whether it’s face, the groin, whatever I’m dealing with.”</p> <p><strong>Ow ow ow ow ow …</strong> Finally, there’s option four: taking the heel off and using it as a weapon.</p> <p><strong>By hitting people with it? </strong>Basically. Hitting or slashing.
