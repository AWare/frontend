Alcuin, who was originally from York but was writing from the safety of Charlemagne's court at Aix-la-Chapelle, said </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>fornications, adulteries and incest have poured over the land, so that these sins have been committed with no shame and even against the handmaidens dedicated to God.

A couple of generations later, however, in 875, with the Vikings by now occupying most of northern England south of the Tyne, and their leader Halfdan threatening to attack northwards, the monks decided that it would be better to move their treasures somewhere safer – St Cuthbert, on his deathbed, was reported to have said that, if the place appeared threatened, they should</p><blockquote><p>take up my bones from the tomb and remove them from this spot.</p></blockquote><p>  The hunt for sanctuary saw the monks and their cargo of bones visiting many places from Cumbria to Yorkshire, with the lengthy anabasis eventually leading to the foundation of Durham Cathedral.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-394305897'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344259075423/lindisfarne_castle.jpg' alt='Lindisfarne Castle' width='160' height='120' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lindisfarne Castle \"with its battled walls\".

In addition a 15 foot long Saxon boat will be on display until the 10th of August, complete with a replica of St Cuthbert's cask, which was rowed to safety in a boat of this kind.  Confusingly, the Saxon boat has been named the <em>Skidbladnir</em>, which, in Norse mythology, was the magical ship belonging to phallic fertility god Frey.  Both boats were made in Northumberland.  Over the weekend of 10-11 August, a raiding party of actors dressed in full Viking costume will re-enact the storming of the priory.

But where does it come from?","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2005-06-15T23:02:24Z","body":"<p>Marks &amp; Spencer shares rose 5p to 351.75p yesterday as investors pondered the prospect of another summer of bid speculation for the troubled retailer. Last year it was Philip Green, this year the takeover talk is focused on an Icelandic raider. </p><p>There are two or three contenders from the rock in the Atlantic but high on any list is Baugur, which has already bought a number of British high-street retailers.  </p><p>By emerging as a prime contender to stalk the sick man of the British high street, the Icelandic retailer has contrived to illuminate the plight of M&amp;S and highlight the growth of a new breed of Viking raider.  </p><p>While Baugur has raced from obscurity to control a large slice of the high street, M&amp;S has shed customers and market share. But the Baugur rise is clouded by broader, lingering questions about the underpinning of the Icelandic miracle.  </p><p>If the stake in M&amp;S is the prelude to a bid then Baugur will be following a path carved out a year ago by Philip Green. His ambitions to acquire M&amp;S were thwarted but he has every reason to follow any Icelandic assault with interest.  </p><p>It was Mr Green's Arcadia group which indirectly whetted Baugur's appetite for British retailing. Baugur had been the Icelandic franchise-holder for a number of Arcadia's businesses, liked what it saw and built a 20% stake in Arcadia. Its ambitions to launch a bid ultimately failed and it ended up pledging its stake to support Mr Green's acquisition.  </p><p>As Baugur has advanced aggressively on to the high street, it has also moved into a property development venture with partners including Tom Hunter, one of Mr Green's allies.  </p><p>However, while Baugur has established links with Mr Green, more intriguing is the fact that its expansion coincides with the appearance of a new breed of slick young Icelandic businessmen who have transformed the country's image from that of insular fisherman into one of a global entrepreneur.  </p><p>That, in turn, exposes Baugur and other potential Icelandic suitors of M&amp;S to the persistent but unsubstantiated whispering that the country's economic miracle has been funded by Russian mafia money rather than growth and liberalisation.  </p><p>It is a miracle that has allowed Icelandic businessmen to march into the British high street and the City of London, capturing assets along the way - even though Iceland's output is about the same size as M&amp;S's market capitalisation. Iceland's corporate cheerleaders have been swift to attribute their success to economic performance and dismiss the mafia money speculation as unfounded.  </p><p>It is only coincidence that Baugur's road to fame and fortune mirrors the remarkable progress of another Icelandic dynasty. Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson and his father, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, have trodden a path which has seen them cast out by Icelandic financial society only to return a decade later as owners of one of the country's largest banks.  </p><p>Bjorgolfur Bjorgolfsson has become Iceland's first dollar billionaire, and the family has created a powerful empire that takes in pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and financial services. Their long-term partner, Magnus Thorsteinsson, is the man behind Excel Airways.  </p><p>In 1993, the three men embarked on a fascinating journey to St Petersburg, Russia. There they helped form the Baltic Bottling Plant. Ownership of that company would later be challenged in the courts but away from the legal battles and recriminations, the Icelanders sold the plant to Pepsi and used the proceeds to move into the brewing business, with the launch of Bravo International.  </p><p>It was 1998, the same year that Baugur was formed. It had grown from the single value-for-money Bonus store set up by the modern Baugur figurehead Jon Asgeir Johannesson and his father in Reykjavik in 1989. When Bonus merged with Hagkaup, a long-established Icelandic retailer, in 1998 Baugur was born.  </p><p>But while Baugur set its sights on the Faroe Islands with the acquisition of 50% of the six-strong SMS supermarket chain, Bravo International was headed for more turbulent waters. The move into brewing was bold. The Russian economy was in crisis and foreign investment drying up.  </p><p>Yet the Icelanders were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the Russian mafia capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice.  </p><p>Yet against all the odds, Bravo went from strength to strength.  </p><p>Other St Petersburg brewing executives were not so fortunate. One was shot dead in his kitchen from the ledge of a fifth-floor window. Another perished in a hail of bullets as he stepped from his Mercedes. And one St Petersburg brewery burned to the ground after a mishap with a welding torch.  </p><p>But the Bravo business, run by three self-confessed naives, suddenly found itself to be one of Russia's leading brewers. In under three years it became the fastest-growing brewer in the country. It secured a 17% market share in the St Petersburg region and 7% in the Moscow area. It was selling 2.5m hectolitres of beer a year in 2001 and heading for 4m when Heineken of the Netherlands stepped in to buy it for  $400m in 2002. Heineken said one of the reasons for the Bravo purchase was the absence of any corruption.  </p><p>With cash in their pockets, it was time for the three men to return home and make their most audacious bid yet: the acquisition of Landsbanki, Iceland's second-largest commercial bank and once the country's central bank.  </p><p>That acquisition represented a poignant return to the banking sector by Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson. In 1991 he had been sentenced to 12-months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, for his part in the Hafskip shipping collapse. Most of the charges against him had been dropped and he has described the remaining charges as technicalities.  </p><p>But given that the Hafskip affair resulted in the enforced rescue of the Fisheries Bank, his reappearance on the board of Samson Holding - the vehicle used by him, his son and Mr Thorsteinsson to acquire Landsbanki - caused a stir in Icelandic banking circles.  </p><p>The deal in late 2002 coincided with the start of the Icelandic miracle. In a prophetic interview in November 2002, Bjorgulfur Thor Bjorgolfsson saw potential on the international horizon. \"Landsbanki is a tiny bank by international standards but nevertheless a footprint to grow from.\"  </p><p>With small operations in London, Guernsey and Luxembourg, an international template was in place. But in 2002 it was not obvious that the Icelandic miracle would be led by a booming economy.  </p><p>Indeed, the economy slipped into mild recession that year and the stock market was only just recovering from the traumas of the global crash that had seen values halve from their February 2000 peak.  </p><p>In mid-2002, the ICEX-15 index of leading stock was hovering around the 1,300 level. Today it is trading at over 4,000. That is an improvement of almost 300%. It is also well over double the pre-crash high of 1888.7. This dramatic improve ment in stock prices has improved confidence and sentiment. Certainly, the latest figures for foreign direct investment in Icelandic stocks produced by the Central Bank of Iceland in December indicate a new enthusiasm in some foreign quarters.  </p><p>Guernsey, for instance, which made no direct investment in Icelandic stocks from 1998 to 2001, began to take an interest in 2002. Some 5.6bn Icelandic krona flowed from the Channel Island in 2002; that more than doubled in 2003 to IKR11.6bn.  </p><p>Luxembourg, which is grouped with Belgium in the bank's analysis, also registered increased funds flowing into Icelandic stocks. The IKR4.4bn recorded in 2000 rose to IKR10bn in 2002 and leapt to IKR25.2bn in 2003. That made it the biggest investing country in Iceland, surpassing the IKR14.7bn ploughed in by the United States, almost half its 2001 level.  </p><p>Rising stock prices have helped underpin the increasing visits that Icelandic companies and financial institutions have made to the international capital markets to fund their expansion.  </p><p>The Baugur experience illustrates how the miracle began in earnest in 2002. Having failed to make a successful bid for Arcadia, selling its stake to Philip Green, it embarked on a new strategy in late 2002.  </p><p>It bought a strategic stake in the Big Food Group, the Iceland frozen foods chain business it now owns, in October 2002. Further strategic stakes have been taken in Somerfield and LXB, the property development group in which Tom Hunter is a co-investor. Baugur has become a regular dabbler in other retail stocks, and has bought the likes of Hamleys, Goldsmiths, Oasis and Karen Millen.  </p><p>Icelandic predators bought &#163;26m worth of British companies in 2002. That figure had swelled to &#163;894m last year.  </p><p>With a market capitalisation approaching &#163;6bn, a successful bid for M&amp;S would represent the biggest fish the Icelanders had ever landed.</p>","headline":"Next-generation Viking invasion","trailText":"<p>They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&amp;S.

John Godber's nonsensical Nordic saga was probably knocked together for about 5p - but it has always been fun to watch Hull Truck making big noises on a little budget. </p><p>Big Trouble in the Little Bedroom is a hilarious piece of hokum about a Viking hammer, set to a snappy pop arrangement by John Pattison. It is probably best described as what might happen if Wagner's Ring cycle were serialised in the Beano.</p><p>Simple Stan finds his homework project - locating a Viking-styled implement - a great deal easier when the hammer of Thor the thunder god turns up in his bedroom, followed by the deity himself. When Stan relinquishes the tool to the school bully, our puny hero has to prove himself worthy of the hammer while its owner is enslaved by his mum to help around the house.</p><p>Godber's idea grew out of his daughter's obsession with Vikings, and a curiosity as to what might happen if one appeared.

The semi-mythological figures of Ragnar and his sons were also at the centre of the Curtis and Douglas epic, but this 10-part drama will chart their conquests while aiming to correct misconceptions about Viking society.</p><p><em>American Gods</em>, Gaiman's mystical cult saga, tells the story of Shadow and his dealings with a modern-day incarnation of the Norse god Odin, or Woden. Gaiman is far from the only popular fiction writer to tap into Viking myth. This month novelist Joanne Harris, the author of <em>Chocolat</em>, brings out the second book in her Norse series. Published by Random House and called <em>Runelight</em>, it follows the story of Maddy Smith, the heroine first established in her 2007 book, <em>Runemarks</em>, who together with Norse gods Loki, Thor and Odin has to prevent the end of the world.</p><p>Also joining the queue to pay tribute to the Vikings is new novel <em>The Bone Thief</em>. Author VM Whitworth, an Anglo-Saxon specialist, said: \"The Viking age is fascinating because of its multicultural glamour. It's full of fast-moving heroes and heroines, and the constant clash of religions and cultures. Thanks to the Vikings, we can write a story that can plausibly take in Ireland and Arabia.\"</p><p>Perhaps the highest-profile arrival in Norse terrain is children's novelist Francesca Simon, author of the Horrid Henry books. Her imagination was sparked by looking at the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx\" title=\"\">Lewis chessmen, </a>the 12th-century Scandinavian ivory pieces in the British Museum, and wondering what would happen if they came to life. \"I decided that the Lewis chessmen were Odin's warriors, asleep and frozen until he summoned them at a time of great peril,\" she explained. Her book, <em>The Sleeping Army</em>, published by Faber, is the result of an abiding love of Norse stories. She is haunted, she said, by the inevitable final flood, fire and death battle, known as Ragnarok, that wipes out both the Earth and the gods.</p><p>Norse mythology is the collective term for the ancient legends of Scandinavia (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland) and one of its main sources is the <em>Edda</em> of Snorri Sturluson, a guide to Old Norse mythology and prosody written in the 13th century.</p><p>Modern British understanding of the Vikings has been skewed by the fact that surviving accounts were written by monks who suffered in their raids and invasions. It is a version of history that is to be counterbalanced in the major Viking exhibition coming to the British Museum in three years' time. The centrepiece of the show will be a 1,000-year-old longship, dragged out of Roskilde harbour, near Copenhagen. The 115ft-long vessel went down in a storm in the early 11th century, during the reign of Canute the Great, who united Denmark, Norway, southern Sweden and England in a Viking empire. It was discovered during a dredging operation in 1997.</p><p>As well as inspiring mainstream entertainment, Norse stories are behind the work of avant-garde Icelandic artist Gabriela Friðriksdóttir, whose exhibition in Frankfurt runs until early next year. The artist has frequently collaborated with Icelandic singer Björk, and her films in particular draw on the dream worlds she creates from Norse mythology. One room in the show, Crepusculum, uses a display of medieval manuscripts that had never left Iceland before. On calfskin parchment, they set out legends of knights and saints, as well as factual reports, law codes and almanacs. This summer at the Edinburgh arts festival the Exquisite Corpse Dance Theatre, from Newcastle upon Tyne, performed a work based on Norse myths to fringe audiences in Leith. Called <em>Valhöll – Hall Of The Slain</em>, it looked at Viking beliefs about conquest and warriors' afterlife.</p>","headline":"It's a new Viking invasion of Britain – but this time it's cultural","trailText":"After the discovery of a Viking burial site in Scotland, Norse history and myths are the focus of a TV saga, epic novels and a major British Museum exhibition","newspaperPageNumber":"15","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/10/21/1319223071794/author-joanne-harris-003.jpg","wordcount":"756","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"380802090","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5362377","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe, arts and media correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2011-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1651520","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-10-25T23:04:22Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/23/viking-culture-invasion-tv-books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/23/viking-culture-invasion-tv-books","tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/historical-drama","webTitle":"Historical drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp;

Think about the word. What does it conjure up? What visions are stirred? When the idea of doing a cycling tour of Denmark's southern islands arose, I lay back, eyes closed and conjured up ... well, not much. A storyteller, a sticky pastry, Europe's tiniest colonial empire consisting of a few atolls and a bucketful of India, the sort of empire that would fit easily into Legoland - the only place I could name apart from Copenhagen.</p><p>I didn't know anyone who had been on holiday to Denmark. I didn't even know it had southern islands to cycle on, and this appalling ignorance drove me to the atlas. What I saw was encouraging: more than 400 islands in total, about a fifth of them clearly inhabited. And dotted across this archipelago worthy of the South Seas were villages with names such as Radby and Harby, a reminder of the Viking heritage shared, I decided, by my own ancestors.</p><p>Maddy (six) liked the idea of being a descendant of Vikings. \"Do they kill people with ginormous axes?\"</p><p>\"Not any more.\"</p><p>Her face fell. \"Do they wear horns?\"</p><p>\"I don't think so.\"</p><p>Further disappointment. \"Will the ferry be like a Viking ship?\" To avoid needless cruelty, I said: \"Yes.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-349746832'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2009/7/3/1246619477248/Summer-in-Denmark-003.jpg' alt='Summer in Denmark' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Kevin Rushby</figcaption></figure><p>It was only later that I realised her question had presumed that we would travel by ferry, not plane. My partner Sophie glowed with green pride. This was to be a totally green trip, as green as it gets. In the event, Maddy's false expectations were deflected by the discovery that the longship had a playroom and a children's pirate club. </p><p>After an overnight voyage we arrive in the unattractive port of Esbjerg, and three hours later we are across Jutland, through Middelfart (Rod Stewart is to play here next week, a Danish lady says) and down to Svendborg in the south of the island of Fyn (which is pronounced Foon).</p><p>Svendborg is a very pretty town of cobbled lanes, laid-back beaches, cafes and music - the latter evident when we walk up to our B&amp;B and find the owner, Anders Ringgaard, playing jazz standards with his trio. Maddy latches on to his seven-year-old daughter, Maya, who can't speak a word of English. The pair walk slowly and silently around the garden, holding hands and gazing at each other. For Maddy, I realise, Denmark is exotic. </p><p>The country's green credentials are better than Britain's. A fifth of electricity is wind-generated, and almost everyone owns and uses a bicycle, including more than a third of commuters in Copenhagen. Our own bicycles were delivered without hitch to the B&amp;B, Maddy and me on an adult-child tandem. Once we had left Svendborg and crossed by bridge to the island of T&aring;singe, we began to pass through exceptionally pretty villages - thatched bungalows decked with flowers and painted doors - but no shops, no attractions, no bars or restaurants, not even any people. Occasionally we saw vast and rather sinister brick bungalows with blacked-out windows. These are the pork factories where pigs are born, live their lives, and die. The \"green credentials\" windmill next door seemed a little irrelevant somehow.</p><p>We pressed on, hoping for better, and we soon found it. Stopping at an attractive thatched cottage to ask directions, we heard about local farmer Peter Bay: \"He's just built the largest straw-bale building in Europe.\"</p><p>We went to find him. Peter proved to be an organic farmer who liked doing things big. He was harvesting millions of radishes when we arrived, but left the tractor to show us around the vast cold storage hanger he has built out of straw. </p><p>\"People have no idea what most farming entails,\" he said. \"Take the wheat - they spray the ground with chemicals to make it grow faster, then spray the wheat with chemicals to make it stop. Short stalks mean less wind damage.\"</p><p>Sickened by such practices, he made his family farm organic 26 years ago: \"People said I was crazy. My own family included.\"</p><p>In Britain, I reckon, we are used to greens being rather small in ambition. In Denmark, it's not like that.  Even when Peter made us coffee, he did it big - an enormous cafeti&egrave;re half-filled with freshly ground beans. Maddy had never tried coffee before, but now took one small cup. Within minutes she was gabbling like a maniac: \"Half a pound of nuts or I'll twist your guts!\" \"What my bike needs is chocolate!\"</p><p>Leaving Peter's farm, I felt as if the wind was behind us. The tandem positively whistled along, powered by Maddy and caffeine. She was pedalling like Chris Hoy chasing a gold medal - head down, knees pumping. Fortunately the system of bridges linking many small islands meant we could keep going, powering across the bridge to Si&oslash; without a break, then clean across to the big island of Langeland. Maddy was singing now, repetitive verses in some made-up language. We zipped through Rudk&oslash;bing and skidded to a halt at the Styrn&oslash; ferry an hour ahead of schedule. Maddy leapt from the bike and started skipping around the carpark while we waited for the boat.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-349746833'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2009/7/3/1246619255485/Summer-in-Denmark-003.jpg' alt='Summer in Denmark' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Kevin Rushby</figcaption></figure><p>Our destination was one of the many small islands strung around the southern shores of Fyn that still rely on ferries. Styrn&oslash; island is a place almost remote by Danish standards, a low flat landscape, full of light and blessed with glorious sunshine as there are no hills to hold clouds, nothing taller than a few beech groves and apple orchards. Coming off the ferry, we made our way to the Smakke Centre, a sailing school, museum and guesthouse run by Flemming Walsted.</p><p>On arrival, both Maddy and Sophie abruptly ran out of steam and fell asleep. I went off with Flemming for a sail in one of his smakke - a traditional craft that was once the only means of transport between the islands. With their nut-brown tarpaulin sails and wooden hulls, the boats are sturdy workhorses, and as the wind rose, pulling spray from the waves, I could see why such a ponderously steady boat was good for the area.</p><p>While we sailed, Flemming told me about the island. Styrn&oslash;'s population of 215 is still far short of the 1920 peak of 800, but it is increasing, the sense of community and identity proving an attraction. \"We have a communal dinner every month,\" Flemming said. \"There is a great feeling of camaraderie.\"</p><p>Touring the 2km-long island by bicycle next day, we got a little insight into the laid-back, friendly attitude. At an isolated house, John Sorenson invited us in for coffee and some of the jam he was making. \"I used to sail the world doing charters on an old schooner,\" he told us, \"then one day I landed here. I noticed nobody locked their houses, cars or bicycles, so I decided to stay.\"</p><p>Leaving Styrn&oslash;, rather sadly, we cycled back across Si&oslash; and T&aring;singe, then took the southern coast of Fyn, passing orchards, woods and fields speckled with poppies and cornflowers. At Ulb&oslash;lle, we stayed with Lisbeth Lauridsen at her wonderfully eccentric guesthouse, Madam Bl&aring;. Dinner was served in a room stuffed with madcap treasures, fluffy things and colourful knick-knacks. The bedroom has a record player and an eclectic collection of LPs.</p><p>The days, and the bikes, rolled by. We got into a groove. The wind seemed less and less annoying, the saddles softer. We visited the 100-year-old smokehouse of Faaborg and washed down smoked salmon with Russian champagne. In the old town I had my hair cut by an Iraqi barber from Basra. Then we left the coast and moved inland, passing through forests and hills that are optimistically known as the Fyn Alps. At Korinth, on our last night, we stayed with Betty Jacoby and Henrik Toft at their B&amp;B, Johan Ludvigs. It was cool, uncluttered and very civilised. Henrik is chairman of a society that promotes local cuisine and our dinner was a feast of Fyn specialities: oat-smoked cheeses with blackcurrant jam on rye breads, organic vegetables, sausages, fruits - an astonishing array of products from one small island.</p><p>Maddy had dressed up and really did well. She tried new things; she tried to like new things; she smiled and chatted. But finally, at the speciality fishball, she could take no more and spat it out on the floor. Sophie wiped it up quickly before Henrik noticed. </p><p>Afterwards, in the cool of the evening, we sat in their garden watching deer creep down to the water at a nearby lake. Then we spread out the map and looked, rather longingly, at all the islands we didn't have time to visit. Much to her own surprise, Sophie had enjoyed her first cycling holiday, though she said she would bring her own saddle next time. </p><p>Maddy was happy too. \"But next time,\" she said, \"I want to see Vikings with horns on their heads.\"</p><h2>Way to go</h2><p><strong>Getting there</strong> </p><p>DFDS ferries (<a href=\"http://www.dfdsseaways.com\">dfdsseaways.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.c2c-guide.co.uk/dfds.html\">c2c-guide.co.uk/dfds.html</a>, 0871 522 9966) sail from Harwich to Esbjerg 3-4 times per week from £162 for two people in a sea-view cabin, one way (£10 extra for two bicycles).

In 1025 it is estimated to have taken more than 30,000 hours of work. This time, lead curator Gareth Williams received \"an enormous Meccano set\" from Denmark, flatpacked in several large containers.</p><p>Williams said the ship, which will launch the museum's new exhibition space in March, was \"a war machine\", a troop carrier which would have spread terror wherever it sailed.</p><p>Although most of its timbers rotted over the centuries it was sunk in the silty water of the harbour at Roskilde, Denmark, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/interactive/2012/dec/27/viking-longboat-roskilde-6-interactive\" title=\"\">the entire length of the keel survived</a>.

Photograph: David Moir/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>The curators have just returned from Shetland where shipbuilders making replica vessels regard themselves as the living inheritors of Viking genes and traditions: DNA tests show many to have Norwegian blood.</p><p>There, a replica at Cullivoe is almost complete, one at Lerwick is ready to be paraded through Shetland's capital on 28 January, and the galley at Scalloway is already a slick of ash on the harbour, having been pushed blazing into the sea last weekend by a bellowing squad of men in helmets, cloaks and mail shirts, battle axes slung on their backs.</p><p>Half of Scalloway, the ancient Viking capital before power shifted south to Lerwick, marched with blazing torches in the procession – joined by rare invitation by the curators and journalists – while the rest lined the narrow Main Street. The parade was led by the elite Jarl's Squad of heavily bearded, costumed Vikings, headed by the Jarl himself, offshore oil worker Kenny Grant boasting a raven-winged helmet.</p><p>As they bellowed the Up Helly Aa song – \"Our galley is the people's right! the dragon of the free; the right that rising in its might brings tyrants to its knee\" – Jarl's Squad,  knew it was part of a carnival tradition invented in the late 19th century, and yet felt the lyrics to be true.</p><p>\"To me the Vikings stand for strength, comradeship and honour,\" Grant said.</p><p>Up Helly Aa is the biggest tourist event in the Shetland calendar, doubling the population of Lerwick in the islands' long winter, and bringing visitors in to the towns and villages which hold fire festivals flanking the main event.</p><p>Not everyone on Shetland likes either the carnival or the Vikings.</p><p>\"They [the Vikings] were a bit psychopathic,\" said Brian Smith, archivist and historian of Up Helly Aa. \"These people achieved remarkable things, but there was always a price to be paid in blood.\"</p><p>In contrast to what he regards as the brutal truth of the Vikings' early years in Shetland, Smith believes that Up Helly Aa has been increasingly sanitised, losing its rough-edged vitality. The tradition of rude rhymes endures – Grant was mocked in Scalloway for shaving the beard he'd been growing for two years in order to travel to Canada for work – but Smith said the targets used to be institutions, the rich and the powerful, not individuals. \"In the old days there were regular threats of legal actions.\"</p><p>Ian Tait, historian and curator of the Shetland museum, is bored by Up Helly Aa – \"I wouldn't cross the room to look out the window\" – but also believes that the true story of the Vikings' arrival in Shetland was drenched in blood.</p><p>\"The question of what happened to the people who were here when the Vikings arrived is not one of the Shetland questions – it is the Shetland question.\"</p><p>Shetland's official archaeologist, Val Turner, believes the sites, where Viking long houses sit beside or even re-use much older structures, are evidence of reasonably peaceful assimilation as the raiders gradually settled and became farmers. But to Smith and Tait it looks more like genocide, with the entire existing population – including the mysterious Picts, who vanished leaving beautiful carvings and a still untranslated language – either slaughtered or enslaved and worked to death.</p><p>\"I admit that there are no pits full of butchered bodies, or if there are we have yet to find them,\" Tait said, \"but every single place name on Shetland is Viking – that doesn't look to me like peaceful assimilation, that is more like year zero, the clock re-set, a contemptuous obliteration of everything that went before.\"</p><p>Williams – a Viking re-enactor for many years until he decided he'd taken too many battle-axe whacks for the good of his scholarship – said: \"The question of the Viking inheritance is a mixed and sometimes dark story – I was honoured to take part in the Scalloway procession&nbsp;… In Scalloway the fire festival is a true community event, organised by people who feel a deep connection with their own past. Some of that history is real, some of it made up, but the sense of engagement with history is real, and something that I've been trying to inspire throughout my entire career.</p><p>\"In a sense I've been carrying a torch for the Vikings all my life.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/vikings.aspx\" title=\"\">• <em>Vikings: Life and Legend is at the British Museum from 6 March until 22 June.</em></a><em> </em></p><p>• This article was amended on 21 January 2014.

Walking bare-footed over the wet sands was the first time my feet had felt comfortable in a couple of days.  Somebody in the bar last night had told me that the best cure for blisters is lancing them and then soaking them in bleach.  That sounds a bit extreme, but walking through sand and seaweed and occasional patches of salt-water mud is about as effective a massage for sore feet as I've ever tried – people probably spend lots of money on treatments like that in a posh spa, and I was getting it for nothing, and enjoying a bright morning in a staggeringly beautiful place at the same time.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-395519143'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346445126776/cuthbert_journeys_end.JPG' alt='Cuthbert Holy Island miracle' width='448' height='336' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Journey's end on St Cuthbert's Way - the Priory on Holy Island</figcaption></figure><p>The setting of the <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/lindisfarne-priory/\">priory</a>, with its ruins and its views over the harbour to the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lindisfarne-castle/\">castle</a>, makes it a very pleasant place to linger and rest your feet.   Cuthbert was buried here for a while before they had to remove his bones (and the Lindisfarne Gospels) from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/07/lindisfarne-vikings-northumberland-heritage-holy-island?INTCMP=SRCH\">invading Vikings</a>.  </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-395519144'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346445268145/cuthbert_lindsifarne_castle_from_the_priory.JPG' alt='Cuthbert Holy Island miracle' width='160' height='120' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lindisfarne Castle from the Priory</figcaption></figure><p>He came back again, briefly, when William the Conqueror was 'harrying of the north' in 1069-70.  The Durham monks, fearing that the Normans might desecrate his tomb, moved his body back to Lindisfarne.  Arriving nearby just before Christmas, they couldn't get onto the island as it was high tide.  Fortunately, according to a contemporary report, </p><blockquote><p>the sea suddenly receding at that spot (but at no other), afforded them the means of passing over, whilst at every other point the tide was at the fullest</p></blockquote><p> and </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>the waves of the sea followed hard upon their footsteps as they advanced, in such-wise as neither, on the one hand, to precede them to any distance, nor on the other, to linger far behind them as they hastened onwards</p></blockquote><p> – so it was clearly not only Moses who could part the waters.  It was probably a good plan to move him, as shortly afterwards William moved north in a devastating punitive raid against rebellious northerners.  The chronicler Symeon, a near contemporary monk from Durham, wrote that </p><blockquote><p>the roads of the north were littered with decaying bodies that spread disease.  Between York and Durham there was not an inhabited town, only lairs of wild animals and robbers, greatly to terrify travellers</p></blockquote><p>English Heritage's little museum at the priory entrance is worth a visit too, with knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff, and displays which manage to tread the difficult balance of being accessible without being patronising.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-395519145'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346445360469/cuthbert_the_gaunt_grandeurof_bamburgh_castle_from_across_the_causeway.JPG' alt='Cuthbert Holy Island miracle Bamburgh' width='160' height='98' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The gaunt grandeur of Bamburgh castle from the Holy Island causeway</figcaption></figure><p>I would probably have enjoyed my time there more if I'd arrived on Holy Island just as the tide was coming in and the tide of cars was going out, rather than vice versa, so it would have been possible to enjoy the place in relatively lonely contemplation.  Even among the crowds it is still a magical place, and of course made more so by the mild feeling of elation that comes from having completed a challenge.

Its form is pressed into the soil and its lines traced by hundreds of rivets, some still attached to scraps of wood.</p><p>An expert on Viking boats, Colleen Batey from the University of Glasgow, dates it to the 10th century.</p><p>At just 5m long and 1.5m wide, it would have been a perilously small vessel for crossing the stormy seas between Scandinavia, Scotland and Ireland. But the possessions buried with him suggest the Viking was a considerable traveller.</p><p>They include a whetstone from Norway, a bronze ringpin from Ireland, his sword with beautifully decorated hilt, a spear and a shield which survive only as metal fittings, and pottery.</p><p>He also had a knife, an axe, and a bronze object thought to be part of a drinking horn. Dozens of iron fragments, still being analysed, were also found in the boat.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.ardnamurchan.com/\" title=\"\">peninsula in the Highlands</a> is still easier to reach by sea than along the single narrow road.</p><p>But with its magnificent mountain, sea and sunset views, it was a special place for burials for thousands of years.</p><p>The oldest, excavated by the same team three years ago, was a 6,000-year-old neolithic grave, and a bronze age burial mound is nearby.</p><p>Hannah Cobb, an archaeologist from the University of Manchester who is co-director of the excavation, said: \"We had spotted this low mound the previous year, but said firmly that it was probably just a pile of field clearance rocks from comparatively recent farming.</p><p>\"When we uncovered the whole mound, the team digging came back the first night and said it looked quite like a boat.</p><p>\"The second night they said: 'It really does look like a boat.' The third night they said: 'We think we really do have a boat'. It was so exciting, we could hardly believe it.\"</p><p>They recovered fragments of an arm bone and several teeth, which should allow analysis of radioactive isotopes and reveal where the man came from.</p><p>The fragments of wood clinging to the rivets should reveal what trees were felled for his ship, and possibly where it was built.</p><p>\"Such burials were reserved for high status individuals,\" Cobb said. \"He may have been a chieftain, a famous navigator, or renowned for his wisdom, but this man was clearly special to his people.\"</p><p>The boat had been almost filled with stones and Cobb believes these must have had meaning for the Vikings.</p><p>\"Rocks are obviously significant as they also appear in other Viking burials,\" she said.</p><p>\"Building a lasting monument to the dead for the living may well be an important factor, and also rooting people in with landscape traditions, given the proximity to the neolithic and bronze age cairns.</p><p>\"We don't think the association with the older monuments can be a coincidence – this was a place which was very important to people over an extraordinarily long period of time.\"</p><p>No trace of a settlement site has been found, but the team will be returning to the peninsula next summer.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/ardnamurchantransitionsproject/\" title=\"\">Ardnamurchan Transitions Project</a> brings together students and academics from several universities working with <a href=\"http://www.cfa-archaeology.co.uk/\" title=\"\">CFA Archaeology</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scottisharchaeology.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Archaeology Scotland</a>.</p><p>The most famous ship burial in Britain, Sutton Hoo – found heaped with treasure and excavated in Suffolk in the shadow of the second world war – looks like anyone's idea of a Viking burial but proved to be Anglo-Saxon, centuries older than the seafaring Scandinavians.</p><p>When overcrowding or yearning for adventure and wealth sent the Vikings overseas in the late eighth century, the sight of their long narrow ships on the horizon struck dread.</p><p>Although their reputation has now been partly rehabilitated and they are recognised as traders, farmers, and brilliant shipwrights and metal and craft workers, a poem written in the margin of an Irish manuscript records a monk's relief that the wild seas that night were too rough even for Vikings.</p><p>In 793, Viking raids forced monks to abandon Lindisfarne, an island off the north-east coast of England, carrying the body of Saint Cuthbert with them.</p><p>But the raiders also struck as far inland as Lichfield and established permanent settlements including York, the Wirral and Dublin.</p><p>The most famous description of a Viking ship burial, complete with the human sacrifice of a woman who volunteered to go with the dead chieftain into the next world – with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_funeral#Ibn_Fadlan.27s_account\" title=\"\">lurid details of drugged potions and ritual sexual intercourse</a> pillaged by generations of novelists and film-makers – was left by a 10th century Arab writer, Ahmad Ibn Fadlan. But archaeology has vindicated much of his account.</p><p>Fadlan's chieftain was cremated along with his ship, leaving only ashes to be buried under a mound. But many Vikings, like the man in Ardnamurchan, were laid in ships with their possessions heaped around them.</p><p>One of the best preserved, holding the remains of two women, was excavated at Oseberg in Norway in the early 20th century.</p><p>The burial dated from around 834 but the ship used was a generation older. The ship's superbly carved bow and stern are now <a href=\"http://www.norway.com/directories/d_company.asp?id=671\" title=\"\">preserved at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo</a>.</p><p>Most of the Viking graves found in Britain are from cemeteries, after the raiders became settled and Christianised.</p><p>There is an intriguing rumoured Viking ship under a pub car park on the Wirral, and there are many claimed earlier ship burial finds – including one almost a century ago on the Ardnamurchan peninsula.</p><p>But all of these had been disturbed or were ransacked by the people who stumbled on them, so none was properly recorded by archaeologists.</p><p>Years of work will follow on the new find, and may reveal whether the man who lay quietly in his ship for 1,000 years was a local resident, a sailor taking shelter from a storm or whether his body was brought specially to the beautiful site for burial.</p>","headline":"Viking chieftain's burial ship excavated in Scotland after 1,000
