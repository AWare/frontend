approximately.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Moist.</p> <p><strong>I’m guessing this is a sweaty kind of networking.</strong> That’s right. You’re getting good at this.</p> <p><strong>Sweaty through fear? I’m often very frightened when I have to talk to people.</strong> No. This is the sweat that comes from exercise. The idea is to have informal meetings while working out, instead of bonding in the traditional ways, such as getting drunk.</p> <p><strong>I get sweaty when I’m drunk sometimes. Will that do?</strong> Not really. It has to be the healthy kind of sweating. The idea has been around <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/fashion/taking-a-client-to-a-gym-for-networking-and-working-out.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">since at least 2011</a>, but now <a href=\"http://www.ukactive.com/\" title=\"\">UK Active</a> has said it should be normal practice.</p> <p><strong>What is UK Active? </strong>It’s a trade body that represents gyms and suchlike. It lobbies to get “more people more active more often”.</p> <p><strong>A noble aim that by coincidence would also make its members richer? </strong>That’s right. But it’s still a good thing. British office workers don’t do enough exercise, as you may know.</p> <p><strong>I sure do. It’s one of the best things about my job! </strong>There’s quite a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health\" title=\"\">evidence</a> that it may be killing you as well.</p> <p><strong>Am I not going to die anyway?</strong> Yes, but sitting still for hours makes you die sooner. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/27/health-risk-one-hour-activity-offset-eight-hours-sitting-desk\" title=\"\">A study in the Lancet last month</a> found that it takes an hour of brisk exercise every day to offset the effect of eight hours’ sitting. Finding an extra hour each day isn’t easy, however, which is where sweatworking comes in.</p> <p><strong>So what, we all jog on the spot in the meeting room?</strong> Not exactly. You might book a spinning class at a gym nearby, or bring a trainer into the office, or just run round the park together.</p> <p><strong>Yeah. Might. </strong>UK Active wants the government to give tax breaks to companies who promote this kind of thing.</p> <p><strong>I bet it does. </strong>The company’s boss, Steven Ward, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/15/companies-urged-to-take-up-sweatworking-to-get-britain-on-move/\" title=\"\">says sweatworking also works miracles on team bonding and creativity</a>, “thanks to the release of endorphins”.</p> <p><strong>Plus you get to see your colleagues looking physically broken, then intimidate them by saying: ‘I could do another lap.’ </strong>You need some more endorphins, I think.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Sorry, I can’t make the 10am meeting. I forgot my trainers.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Those are good points, Gary. I’ll explain right after I throw up in this bin.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"413","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T13:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T13:04:04Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T13:49:49Z","internalComposerCode":"57b1bdc4e4b0178756b5ce05","internalOctopusCode":"11812809","internalPageCode":"2657561","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-15T21:00:25Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

You would select “text” on your television remote, then type in the number of the page you wanted to read, then wait for ages, then the page would (usually) pop up.</p> <p><strong>It sounds quite like the internet. </strong>Yes.

It only has 12 pages of news for now, but it can also display tweets and pictures in that lovely blocky format. It’s <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/how-teletext-and-ceefax-are-coming-back-from-the-dead-1326145\" title=\"\">an experiment</a>, by nerds.</p> <p><strong>I thought they might be at the bottom of this.

The nerds are having a lot of fun.

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Incredible value for money.</p> <p><strong>Hello, I’m thinking about going to university. </strong>Stop right there, my fine fellow. Have I got a guaranteed, once-in-a-lifetime, money-saving, wallet-caving, brain-straining bargain for you!</p> <p><strong>You sound suspicious. </strong>On the contrary, good sir. I am a representative of one of Britain’s finest seats of learning, and today I’m offering you a deal so insane that you’ll ignore my insensitive reference to mental illness: a bogof degree!</p> <p><strong>A what?</strong> A bogof degree! Enrol for an undergraduate course with me today and I’ll give you a free – YES, FREE! – master’s course worth an incredible £10,000! All you need to do is sign on the dotted line.</p> <p><strong>Are you for real?</strong> Yes! We need to keep up with the market. Sheffield is giving top students the chance of a free master’s course worth up to £10,000, Kingston is offering 25% off a master’s and Kent will give you £1,000 off <em>and</em> 10% off the tuition fees of any spouses or siblings who also want to do a degree.</p> <p><strong>This is depressing. </strong>God, I know. Don’t tell anyone, but we’re being pummelled. There are fewer 18-year-olds around than in previous years – and Brexit will probably stop overseas students from coming here – and we’ve got spaces to fill. It’s tacky, and I’m ashamed of myself, but what can you do? Anyway, STEP RIGHT UP!</p> <p><strong>This isn’t what education is about, is it? </strong>What do you mean?</p> <p><strong>Surely it’s about expanding your horizons and gaining independence, not about materialistic freebies. </strong>Oh, I can tell you’re a hard nut to crack, sir. What if I threw in some Premier League football tickets? That’s what De Montfort is doing.</p> <p><strong>Good God, is it really? </strong>Please sir, I need this. Just say the word. You want an iPad too? We’ve got iPads as far as the eye can see! I’ll give you 10 iPads!</p> <p><strong>You’re doing nothing to dismiss the sensation that education is becoming something you can buy off the peg. </strong>Fine, I’ll give you the keys to my car and that’s my final offer.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Education is not simply a monetary transaction.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Chuck in a set of steak knives and I’m in.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"399","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-11T10:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T10:03:22Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T10:41:51Z","internalComposerCode":"57a858eae4b0f5d064841698","internalOctopusCode":"11790158","internalPageCode":"2639186","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-10T15:29:52Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

“laird”.</strong> Then I apologise. What’s your full title?</p> <p><strong>I am Laird of Glencairn.

For £30?</p> <p><strong>Yes. </strong>From a company that promised you the title in return for buying 8 sq in of a Highland estate?</p> <p><strong>Yes. </strong>Then be careful. The Court of the Lord Lyon, the official heraldic authority for Scotland, has just reaffirmed that titles bought online have no legal status.</p> <p><strong>But I was just about to apply for a coat of arms. </strong>You definitely shouldn’t do that.

Do you live in Scotland?</p> <p><strong>No.</strong> It also states the requirement that “the petitioner should be, in terms of the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672, a ‘virtuous and well-deserving person’”. Are you a virtuous and well-deserving person?</p> <p><strong>Well, I call myself Laird on my credit cards in the hope that I will get a better table at a restaurant, so I suppose not.</strong> Just to make it completely clear, then, the Court of the Lord Lyon says: “The ownership of ‘souvenir’ plots of land of a few square feet or thereby, such as are marketed from time to time, is insufficient to bring anyone within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.”</p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>It means you are a weird fraud with ideas far above your station.</p> <p><strong>It does get me good seats in restaurants, though.</strong> It does? Where can I buy one of these titles?</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I am Laird of Glencairn.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And so am I. And so is he. And everyone over there.

It’s a sort of unmanned till with an irritating robot voice.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for that. Now if you wouldn’t mind, I’m …</strong> Unexpected item in bagging area.</p> <p><strong>Yes, that’s the tin of chick peas I just scanned.</strong> It looks like a bottle of vodka.</p> <p><strong>Maybe it’s because I’m using my own bag, but I swear … </strong>Please wait for a member of staff to assist you.</p> <p><strong>Are you accusing me of stealing? </strong>No, but the University of Leicester is. A new report from its Department of Criminology suggests that self-checkout technology encourages even normally honest shoppers to commit theft.</p> <p><strong>How? </strong>Some of it’s accidental – people forget to scan items, or get confused by instructions.</p> <p><strong>That’s not stealing.</strong> Other times shoppers get so frustrated with self-service kiosks that they feel justified in not paying.</p> <p><strong>If the machine is messing you about, what else can you do? I have places to be!</strong> But mostly people shoplift because the technology makes it so easy.</p> <p><strong>You know what? I think the supermarkets want you to steal. </strong>I doubt that. The report found that installing self-service checkouts raises lost revenue by 122%.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Mobile phone scanning technology is just as vulnerable – the study found that at the end of a typical shopping trip, up to 10% of items had not been scanned, leading to “shrinkage” (loss through wastage or theft) of about 3.9% of turnover.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but they’re also saving money by making me do all the work for them. This free box of Shreddies is basically my salary. </strong>That’s a flatscreen TV.</p> <p><strong>It’s not my fault I couldn’t lift it on to the scanner!

Oh, and maybe Nigel Farage.</p> <p><strong>Really? You think? </strong>Well, the contents of Le Petit Maurice are a closely guarded secret, but, if I were Juncker, Farage would get an entire chapter to himself, and it would be illustrated with doodles of him being torn apart by goats.

It’s almost like he wants someone to steal it and publish it.</p> <p><strong>Or maybe he can smell a book deal. </strong>Yes! He’ll quit, Le Petit Maurice will be published in hardback and Hollywood will make a movie adaptation of it, in which Juncker will be played by Ryan Gosling and Farage will be played by a frog that has been left out in the sun too long. What a blockbuster!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “What do we have to do to get inside Little Maurice?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Keeping a book of your enemies is something that only
