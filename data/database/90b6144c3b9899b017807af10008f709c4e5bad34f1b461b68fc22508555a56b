Twelve of us, in full cold-weather gear, had picked our way carefully across a snow-covered ice field and climbed into the windowless compartment at the back of the aircraft. We squashed ourselves against the walls, the remaining space jammed with luggage and cargo boxes. The two back doors slid shut and the helicopter, fully laden, lifted into the air.</p><p>Over the pilot’s shoulder, we craned our necks to glimpse the stacked and tumbled ice below, stretching to the horizon in all directions. We had been stuck here, off the coast of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, for more than a week. Several icebreakers had tried and failed to break a path to our ship, the Akademik Shokalskiy, but seeing the endless field of compressed ice from above, and the seemingly tiny Shokalskiy embedded within it, brought  the situation into a whole new focus. For many of us, it played on our minds that we were leaving behind the Shokalskiy and its crew, our friends, to an uncertain fate.</p><p>This ship had been our home for almost a month.

The first evening at sea, many passengers were missing at dinner, lying in their bunks, dipping in and out of waves of nausea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/akademik-shokalskiy-cinemagraph-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051268\"                data-video-name=\"MV Akademik Shokalskiy - cinemagraph\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512375624/Shokalskiy-Cinemagraph-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430900358\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512359660/Shokalskiy-Cinemagraph-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/28//ShokalskiyCinograph.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/27/ShokalskiyCinograph/ShokalskiyCinograph.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The MV Akademik Shokalskiy crosses the Southern Ocean as it makes its way towards East Antarctica as part of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On board were 22 Russian crew members and 52 passengers, part of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013 (AAE); half of these were scientists, half members of the public who had paid around A$18,000 (£9,700) to work as science assistants on the journey south. The Shokalskiy’s destination, 10 days away, was Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica, a historic part of the continent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/04/scientists-antarctic-explorer-douglas-mawson\">first visited a century ago by the great British-Australian explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson</a>. A contemporary of Shackleton, Amundsen and Scott, Mawson led the original AAE in 1911. The modern expedition, led by University of New South Wales climate scientist <a href=\"http://www.christurney.com/\">Chris Turney</a>, intended to follow in his footsteps and <a href=\"http://www.spiritofmawson.com/the-science-case/\">record how this remote part of the world has changed in the past 100 years</a>; it would look at the impact of climate change on animal populations and on the temperature and saltiness of the sea. I was invited along to report the journey, with film-maker Laurence Topham: too often, journalists see only the results of work that has taken years to produce, missing the many twists and turns, and the humanity of how science is really done.</p><p>The scientists began their observations, with help from the volunteers, as soon as the sea-sickness subsided. They counted bird populations from the bridge, to monitor how the species changed as we progressed south. Oceanographers spent a 40-hour stint throwing hi-tech probes overboard at regular intervals to measure the temperature and saltiness of the ocean. Ecologists looked for seals to work out what they were eating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/antarctica-map-shokalskiy\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051294\"                data-video-name=\"Map: Shokalskiy's route from New Zealand to East Antarctica\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513670529/Antarctica-map-A-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430902295\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513666617/Antarctica-map-A-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Map: Alex Purcell</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we sailed farther south, the water and air got colder, the ship felt more alone in the rolling sea and the days got longer until, eventually, the sun never left the sky. The passengers, strangers at first, got closer as they swapped stories and took part in lectures, talked about their lives back home and shared meals in the two small dining rooms.</p><p>Antarctica imposed itself into this tight-knit world one morning when we awoke to calm seas and a series of loud bangs, sounding worryingly like explosions, coming from the bow of the ship. Stepping on to the foggy deck, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/23/antarctica-penguins-icebergs-coast-video\">we saw brilliant white chunks of ice</a>, some the size of football pitches, surrounding the ship. “You go from rolling open water to suddenly calm, almost serene, broken floes of ice, like shattered glass,” Turney says. “And as you break and weave your way through, everything is so quiet.”</p><p>Making our way through the floes, we spotted small groups of <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/birds/adelie-penguin/\">Adélie</a> and <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/birds/emperor-penguin/\">Emperor</a> penguins, which showed a passing interest in our ship before turning away or sliding off the ice and into the water. As the ship crunched and ground its way along, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/16/antarctica-live-iceberg-akademik-shokalskiy-video\">we saw our first iceberg</a> materialise from the haze like a developing photograph. Tens of metres high, hundreds of metres long, this mass of ice dwarfed our vessel. Sailing alongside one edge, we saw that its surface, perfect white from a distance, was lined with crevasses and pitted with caves, out of which glowed an electric blue light.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/penguin-cinemagraph-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051272\"                data-video-name=\"Adélie penguins of Antarctica - cinemagraph\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512713521/Penguin-Cinemagraph-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430900563\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512708240/Penguin-Cinemagraph-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/27/PenguinCinemagraph/PenguinCinemagraph.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/28//PenguinCinemagraph.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>Harsh, savage and unpredictable</h2><p>What looked to me like an office block had to previous explorers conjured castles and cathedrals. Ben Maddison, a historian and Antarctic veteran making his tenth journey south on the Shokalskiy, told me, “In the middle of the 19th century, gothic sensibilities started to creep into explorers’ accounts – seeing in the shapes of the ice the ruins of civilisation, collapsed buildings, cathedrals, minarets. I love the way the ice has always reflected contemporary concerns, culture and perceptions.”<br></p><p>The Shokalskiy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/17/end-world-antarctica-expedition-douglas-mawson\">reached the edge of the ice at Commonwealth Bay</a> on an azure-skied afternoon, eight days after leaving port. Out on deck, it was incongruously warm. Icebergs glittered on the sea behind us; ahead rose mountains and the dome of the polar icecap. The captain dropped anchor and, after the scientists had unloaded their equipment and checked that the surface was safe to walk on, we were allowed down the gangplank.</p><p>There are a lot of things to get used to the first time you spend any time in Antarctica. The vistas of tumbled ice, for example, that look like Martian landscapes and which you have to continually remind yourself are part of the same planet on which you have grown up. The sheer distance you can see in every direction and gigantic scale of the mountains and walls of ice. The total absence of plants. The sensory disorientation that comes with true silence, no natural smells and the endless white of the ice that often bleeds into the sky.<br></p><p>All of these details, however, are just the veneer of beauty that overlays Antarctica. The continent is, above all, harsh, savage, and unpredictable. It is an extreme place that is uninhabitable and which cannot be bent to fit the needs of its visitors.</p><p>We stayed close to the ship that evening, entranced by penguins waddling around the edge of the sea ice. We arrived back, exhilarated, well after midnight. With the sun so high and bright in the sky, and no sign of tiredness in any of the group, it might as well have been midday.</p><p>Nobody owns Antarctica. Since 1961, <a href=\"http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm\">the Antarctic Treaty</a> has bound its signatories (more than 50 at the last count) to using the continent only for peaceful purposes, with the priority being scientific research (no disposal of nuclear waste, no military exercises, no weapons testing). “It’s one of the few places where there haven’t been military flare-ups,” says John Shears, head of operations at the British Antarctic Survey. “Even during the Falklands war, there were friendly relations between British and Argentine bases here.” And even as more countries have signed up and commercial activities such as fishing and tourism have expanded, territorial claims have stayed in the background. Instead countries will quietly assert themselves by building more bases: the US has six, the UK two, Australia three and China four.</p>  <blockquote><p>Oceanographers found the water under the sea ice was less salty than a century ago. This could have an impact on climate all over the world</p></blockquote>  <p>A week after arriving at the Antarctic coast, the Shokalskiy’s passengers were out on the Hodgeman Islands, a scrap of land bound by 10km of ice. The ship had dropped anchor at Cape de la Motte and the AAE members were being ferried by boat and all-terrain vehicles to the islands, so they all got a chance to walk on the Antarctic continent itself. The week had been eventful, the highlight being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/20/sea-ice-mawsons-huts-antarctica\">two successful journeys by small teams across 65km of ice</a> to carry out research and conservation work on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/gallery/2013/dec/23/inside-douglas-mawsons-antarctic-base-in-pictures\">Douglas Mawson’s huts at Cape Denison</a>. No one had thought that journey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/23/longest-drive-sea-ice-antarctica\">two years in the planning</a>, would be possible until the AAE team carefully picked their way through the tumbled, melting ice field, on vehicles that were, in essence, boats with wheels.</p><p>The oceanographers found that the water under the sea ice at Commonwealth Bay was less salty than a century ago. This shift could have major implications for how water and heat move around the world’s oceans. Global currents are driven by cold, salty water descending to the depths and pulling in warmer water from the equator; a change at the poles could have an impact on climate all over the world, way into the future. Ornithologists also found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/24/the-penguins-of-cape-denison\">big changes in the penguin populations</a> near Mawson’s huts, a result of local changes in climate. The colonies were scattered and silent, littered with dead chicks and abandoned eggs.</p><p>The excursion to the islands would be our last stop on the continent before we began the long journey home. In the evening, however, it became clear that something was not quite right. “The ice was closing quickly around us and throughout that night the captain fought very hard to get the vessel out into open water,” says Greg Mortimer, AAE’s head of logistics and a veteran of more than 100 visits to Antarctica. “But he couldn’t: there was too much ice closing in, like a big vice.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c15ec8a6-bab3-460d-97e3-9f48bffd08a9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526136579/132482c5-4d30-45b7-aefd-5a057bcd265e-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The Shokalskiy icebound in Antarctica. Photograph: Laurence Topham\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Shokalskiy icebound in Antarctica</figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were not the kind of young, thin ice floes the Shokalskiy had been easily cutting through in the days before, but dense chunks of ice that had grown tough over many winters. The following morning, Christmas Eve, brought an unexpectedly peaceful scene: the ship was surrounded, unable to move. From the bridge, Mortimer says, they could see open water two or three nautical miles away.</p><p>We were around two miles from the Antarctic coast and 1,500 miles from Hobart, Tasmania. South-westerly winds were pushing thick ice floes against the continent, pinning the ship in place. We waited for the ice to open up: if the wind direction changed for even a few hours, it could create a lead through the ice.</p><p>On Christmas Day, however, the situation was worse, and the Shokalskiy was even farther from open water. The captain, Igor Kiselev, sent out a distress call, triggered by the movement of two nearby icebergs. As ice floes move, so does any ship within them, but icebergs move independently. “You see one that is 50m high but there’s probably 250m below the water,” Mortimer says. “An iceberg can go through pack ice as if it didn’t exist.”</p>  <blockquote><p>Scientists questioned the ship’s research aims: why had it ventured into an area of sea known to be prone to pack ice?</p></blockquote>  <p>The distress call was relayed to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) office in Canberra, whose emergency response division concluded that the weather conditions (0°C and winds of up to 90kph) and the possibility that the Shokalskiy might get damaged and lose heat or power was reason enough to warrant a rescue. Amsa issued a broadcast to local shipping on Christmas morning. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long (”Snow Dragon”) and French vessel L’Astrolabe were the first to say they would come to our aid. “I felt it was our duty to come to the place as quick as we could,” says Wang Jianzhong, captain of the Xue Long since 2010 and a 19-year veteran of the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/poles\">polar regions</a>. His ship was on its way to build a new base on the Antarctic coast but he agreed to divert towards the Shokalskiy, then 600 nautical miles away. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis, which was several days away resupplying <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/stations/casey\">Casey</a>, the Australian Antarctic base, was also asked to assist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2014/feb/22/antarctica-map-rescue-operation\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051293\"                data-video-name=\"Antarctica map: international rescue operation\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513533101/Antarctica-map-B-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430901960\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513512005/Antarctica-map-B-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapB-16x9.mp4\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Map: Alex Purcell</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the Shokalskiy, one of the paying passengers, Adelaide-based Terry Gostlow, remembers a stunned silence after we were told about the distress call: “I knew enough about how far we were from anywhere to know this was a serious situation. A chill went through me.” But as the passengers settled into waiting mode, “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/31/new-year-2014-board-akademik-shokalskiy-video\">the mood became almost jovial</a>, as we found things to do and got a calendar of events going. It was quite boisterous, considering the situation we were in.”</p><p>Two days later, the Shokalskiy had its first radio contact with the Xue Long, 40 miles away. “Several hours later, we saw Xue Long out of the mist on our horizon,” Mortimer says. “That was a fantastic moment, because it humanised the situation. We weren’t just a radio call – all of a sudden we were humans there, stuck on a ship.”</p><h2>Out on deck that evening, we watched the Xue Long, a red dot on the horizon. “It was making great progress,” Turney says. “It was pushing through, coming towards us, and I was thinking, gosh, with any luck it could be here by morning.”</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/27/antarctic-mission-icebreaker-delay-rescue\">Next morning, though, the Xue Long was still a dot</a>. “The visibility was very poor,” Captain Wang says. “The sea ice became more and more dense – it was very difficult for us to break it.” By now, L’Astrolabe had arrived at the ice edge, but its icebreaking capability was even less than Xue Long’s. With both icebreakers unable to reach the ship, the Shokalskiy would have to wait for the Aurora Australis, still several days away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cf84da82-be8f-408d-805a-d390f76e65db\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526360934/3b139814-d489-49cf-9fd3-e0f41a338539-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunrise over the Shokalskiy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sunrise over the Shokalskiy</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>‘Our world was flipped on its head’<br></h2><p>Meanwhile, the world’s media had picked up on the story. What began as a few interview requests from New Zealand and Australian radio stations soon multiplied into interest from all over the world. For eight days after Christmas, there was a near-continuous demand for updates and interviews, particularly from US networks. <a href=\"http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/02/anderson-kathys-craziest-new-years-eve-moments/\">On New Year’s Eve, we broadcast live to CNN’s news anchor Anderson Cooper</a>, streaming footage from the top deck of the Shokalskiy to Times Square in New York. <br></p><p>There was controversy, too: <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-question-rescued-polar-expedition-1.14510\">scientists questioned the AAE’s research aims</a> and asked why the ship had ventured into an area of sea known to be prone to pack ice. They argued that the scientific work being carried out by the Australian, French and Chinese icebreakers, all diverted to help the Shokalskiy, <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">would be significantly affected</a>. By the time the Aurora Australis arrived at the edge of the ice field, every move was being tracked by news reporters around the world.</p><p>In that time, another 20 nautical miles of ice had blown in between us and open water. After more than a day of battling against it, the master of the Aurora Australis, Murray Doyle, decided he would not be able to get his ship anywhere near the Shokalskiy: the ice was too thick and he had neither the fuel nor the time to break it.</p><p>“Once again, our world was flipped on its head,” said Mortimer. It soon became clear that the only way to get people off the Shokalskiy as soon as possible would be to use the Xue Long’s helicopter, called the Xue Ying (which translates as “Snow Eagle”), to take people onto the Aurora Australis.</p><p>Mortimer, liaising with the Chinese and Australian captains from the bridge of the Shokalskiy, took the whole day on January 2 for the pieces to fall into place and for the rescue to begin.</p><p>There would be five helicopter flights from the Shokalskiy to the Aurora Australis, each with 12 passengers and as much luggage and scientific equipment as they could cram in. Captain Kiselev decided that he and the Russian crew of the Shokalskiy would remain on board and await further icebreaker assistance to get his ship out of the ice. There were 22 crew members who stayed on board. The passengers shook hands with some of the sailors who were helping us out, and with parting hugs, we wished each other luck.</p><p>Ben Maddison’s job that day was to safely guide the groups of 12 passengers from the Shokalskiy for each flight, across the ice and onto the helicopter. “The power of the [helicopter] was enormous. It’s like the whole air was vibrating with the wash of those two rotors,” he says. “We were walking through snow that was, in places, a metre or so deep and people were plunging up to their knees or further into the snow. Doing that amidst a very significant down draft, with ice crystals blowing into your face and a powerful noise - added up to an intimidating environment for most people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4cb09ff3-6de5-4358-87f9-8d29bc2c3660\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526706516/026f5c2c-36c3-48ee-8ae4-d39aa469c720-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Passengers prepare to evacuate by helicopter\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Passengers prepare to evacuate by helicopter</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mortimer was on the last flight, six hours after the rescue began. He says the ice he saw was “phenomenal. It was huge, multi-year-old, under extreme pressure, so that the edges of the floes had crumpled into towers as they bashed together. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/gallery/2014/jan/22/passengers-rescued-antarctic-hobart-pictures\">There was virtually no channel of open water between us and the Aurora Australis</a>.” <br></p><p>It took the Shokalskiy and the Xue Long another week to break free, as they waited for the wind to turn and open up leads in the ice. The Shokalskiy arrived safely back in Bluff on 14 January.</p><h2>‘We were in the wrong place at the wrong time’<br></h2><p>Though their summer programme has been delayed, the Chinese crew were celebrated at home for their role in our rescue. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\">President Xi Jinping</a>, <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/202936/8503460.html\">who reportedly kept a close eye on the ship’s progress</a>, has previously said that China needs to be ready to take advantage of the resources in the polar regions. The country is building a second icebreaker, bigger than the Xue Long, to expand its activities; Xue Long is scouting locations for a fifth Chinese base at Terra Nova Bay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6be53551-1ac2-4b64-bd90-a21b817e0f0c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526868836/c28fd4ec-d520-4553-b813-0118201b311d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunset on the helipad of the Aurora Australis\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Passengers on the helipad of the Aurora Australis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There are obvious political reasons why people are interested in the Antarctic region,” says Mike Sparrow, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.scar.org/\">Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research</a>. “Part of it is to be seen as a global player – people want to be a member of a lot of these international treaties.” India, Russia, Japan, Germany and many others maintain interests here. The <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/environmental_issues/environmental_protocol.php\">Madrid Protocol</a>, signed in 1991, bans mining or other exploitation of the environment; but the protocol is due for renegotiation in 2048 – and as the technology to drill around the continent becomes available, it’s far from clear that its signatories will maintain the ban.</p><p>What caused the massive breakout of old ice from the edge of the continent, which moved and trapped the Shokalskiy, is still unclear. “We’re looking at the satellite information, we’re working with colleagues in Germany and elsewhere to try and get a feeling for what happened there,” says Turney. “Whatever it was, something happened which mobilised this massive amount of very old thick ice, and then basically caught us and then built up progressively over the next 40 hours.”</p><p>But for veterans, the unexpected nature of Antarctica is part of life there. “We were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Mortimer says. “We were not in that situation irresponsibly; we were in that situation wittingly. And we have dealt with it extraordinarily well, with ship, crew and passengers sane and healthy. It’s hard, sitting in your lounge, in a gentle part of the world, to understand the forces that are at work. But they’re much bigger than puny human efforts. They have been in the past, and they will be in the future.”</p>","headline":"Rescue from Antarctica","trailText":"After a month aboard a Russian research ship, <b>Alok Jha</b> and <b>Laurence Topham</b> found themselves trapped in the grip of the ice – and an international row over whether the expedition should have been there in the first place<br>","newspaperPageNumber":"52","shouldHideAdverts":"true","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393525212570/556d4089-13c5-478f-aab3-4c04690ee0c3-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"3359","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"430920864","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"530f7d77e4b01bd15abf322d","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Report: Alok Jha, video and photographs: Laurence Topham","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2051489","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-03T09:00:15Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2014/feb/28/-sp-rescue-from-antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/antarctica-live/2014/feb/28/-sp-rescue-from-antarctica","tags":[{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"science/antarctica-live","webTitle":"Antarctica live","description":"Full interactive and multimedia coverage as the Guardian joins the 2013-2014 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which commemorates the centenary of the first AAE led by Sir Douglas Mawson","type":"blog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/antarctica-live","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alokjha","webTitle":"Alok Jha","rcsId":"GNL006494","r2ContributorId":"15338","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749328301/AlokJha.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733049/AlokJha.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alok Jha is a science correspondent at the Guardian.

Expedition leaders then asked for volunteers among the AAE members to help prepare a landing area for the helicopter from the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long on a suitable ice floe next to the Russian-operated ship.</p> <p>The Chinese vessel will wait for better weather and visibility before launching the evacuation. On Tuesday morning conditions were not yet suitable, with rain, heavy winds and clouds.</p> <p>&ldquo;We're not going to be flying today, possibly not even tomorrow,&rdquo; said Chris Turney, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales and a leader of the AAE.</p> <p>The Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis, arrived at the edge of the sea ice surrounding the Shokalskiy &ndash; about 20 nautical miles away &ndash; in the early hours of 30 December, local time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica-live/gallery/2013/dec/27/antarctica-live-rescue-mission\">It made several attempts to cut through the ice over the next day</a> but was thwarted each time. On Tuesday morning its captain confirmed that the vessel would move to join the Xue Long, which itself unsuccessfully tried to break through the ice on Friday last week, to co-ordinate the air evacuation.</p> <p>AAE members will be picked up on the ice next to the Shokalskiy and dropped off on a similar landing pad next to the Aurora Australis. The Chinese helicopter that will be used is too heavy to land on the Australian vessel's deck. The Aurora Australis will then sail to the nearest Australian Antarctic base, Casey, before heading back to Hobart in Australia in late January.</p> <p>Turney said the expedition team was disappointed that the Shokalskiy had been unable to break free from the ice with help from the icebreakers and get home under its own steam.</p> <p>&ldquo;We've been so unfortunate &ndash; there was a massive breakout of very thick, old ice from the other side of the Mertz glacier, and it was swept to sea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There's just no way through it. Many of the icebreakers just can't get through.&rdquo;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-00c58081-6040-4049-9e05-361975bfb22d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/31/1388471910080/The-Chinese-helicopter-th-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Chinese helicopter that will airlift crew and  passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Chinese helicopter that will airlift crew and passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy. Photograph: Laurence Topham/Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Russian crew of the Shokalskiy will be given extra provisions and will remain on board after the AAE members have been evacuated. They will remain in position until the Shokalskiy can break out of the ice &ndash; either on its own, if the winds change and blow the ice apart, or when stronger icebreaking vessels can come to help.</p> <p>The American icebreaker, the Polar Star, is about 10 days away and an even bigger Russian icebreaker, the Federov, is 28 days away. Either could be called upon to help the Shokalskiy if required.</p> <p>Turney also responded to speculation from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/afneil/status/417316242702090241\">climate sceptics who have taken to social media sites in recent days to attack the scientific consensus on climate change</a>,&nbsp;pointing out the apparent incongruity of there being so much sea ice around the Shokalskiy in the middle of the Antarctic summer.</p> <p>&ldquo;There's a misconception here &ndash; we are not trapped in new ice that's been created because its cold,&rdquo; said Turney. &ldquo;This is very old, thick ice that's been re-mobilised. It was attached to another part of the continent and has broken out and, with the south-easterly winds we've had, has pushed it up against the coast &hellip; and pinned us in.&rdquo;</p> <p>The event is likely to be a result of long-term climate change that is happening in this part of the world. When the 120km-long iceberg, B09B, came through the area a few years ago it knocked the tongue off the nearby Mertz glacier, which itself is 120km long. The iceberg grounded on the sea bed in Commonwealth Bay causing the sea around it to lock up with ice attached to the continent.</p> <p>&ldquo;There's no Mertz glacier tongue to hold back the sea ice that broke out in the past weeks,&rdquo; said Turney. &ldquo;Because there's ice in Commonwealth Bay, where we're near, that old ice couldn't go anywhere apart from here.

Talking was impossible by this point, so we were signalled just to keep close to the person in front, through the blizzard of snow and small chunks of ice, as we walked the last 50 metres to the aircraft. On board we were jammed in with as much luggage as would fit in between and on top of us all, and then we were off.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, flying over a seeming neverending surface of white and past the helicopter's mother ship, the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long, we set down on an ice floe, 100m from the Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. It took less than 15 minutes for the crew to unload us and the baggage and then the helicopter was gone, a dot in the sky, on its way back to the Shokalskiy to pick up more people.</p><p>The most surprising thing about our evacuation was that, after the amount of time we had spent preparing for the moment, it was all over so quickly.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426208893'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388664648591/f702bf24-5374-4b8a-9564-7f52f26e0b90-460x276.jpeg' alt='Antarctica Live: helicopter landing' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The helicopter lands on the makeshift helipad. Photograph: Laurence Topham/Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>On Thursday, we had woken on our ship  to glorious sunshine. Standing on the top deck, you could see the enormous ice cap of Antarctica two nautical miles awat to port. All around, a field of solid ice stretched in every direction to the horizon – an alien landscape of white boulders and flattened mini-icebergs. The rain and relatively warm temperatures of the past two days had melted a large pool at the stern of our vessel, revealing dark, cold water that lapped up against the edge of a thick ice floe and into which three adelie penguins spent most of the afternoon swimming, floating or leaping.</p><p>The past few evenings we had been told to prepare ourselves for a potential evacuation the following morning. That meant suitcases packed and labelled, important items including passports and house keys stashed in a small bag that we were to keep with us at all times during the frenzy of the rescue – but every subsequent morning we had been stood down.</p><p>By mid-afternoon on Thursday, many of us were resigned to another delay. Several dozen passengers and crew had spent hours in the canteen together helping the cooks to make palmini, a type of Russian dumpling, for dinner. A group of passengers had set up a domed tent on the ice, with chairs and mats inside, to do readings from diaries and articles that they had written over the course of the recent weeks, their thoughts and reflections of Antarctica.</p><p>Though the visibility was good and the weather had been generally perfect for helicopter flight all day, the two icebreakers that were co-ordinating our rescue had been having trouble reaching each other. The plan had been that, when the weather allowed it, we would be helicoptered to the Xue Long, then taken by barge to the Aurora Australis. The plan was carefully choreographed and every element had to be just right for it to work properly.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426208894'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388681802477/363439e7-cf45-4c8d-be52-efe00b0ac75c-460x276.jpeg' alt='Antarctica Live: Alok Jha on the deck of the Aurora Australis' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Alok Jha safely on the deck of the Aurora Australis. Photograph: Laurence Topham/Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The Xue Long, though, was having trouble getting itself out of the ice field it had entered on Friday when trying to reach the Shokalskiy. The Aurora Australis had made some progress through the ice in the past few days, getting to within 2.5 nautical miles of the Xue Long, but couldn't get any closer. With the two vessels too far apart in the open water, but with a perfect weather window available, we needed a new plan.</p><p>By the time the KA32 helicopter came to test out the Shokalskiy's helipad on Thursday, that new plan had been put in place by the ship captains and we were told as the helicopter landed: we would fly from the ice floe next to the Shokalskiy directly to an ice floe next to the Aurora Australis.</p><p>The next four hours were a blur. Afterwards, several of us remarked about how little time there had been to say goodbye to the brilliant Russian crew who had been our companions these past few weeks, looking after us on the Shokalskiy. It was always the intention that the 20 crew members would stay on the ship to wait for further icebreaker assistance – the American and Russian icebreakers the Polar Star and Federov are a few weeks away from the Shokalskiy's position. The speed of our departure meant that there had barely been time to shake hands and wish the crew the best possible luck.</p><p>On board the Australian vessel the crew welcomed us with drinks, offered us dinner and, when the ship's master, Murray Doyle, came to talk to us, people shouted \"thank you\" and burst into applause before he spoke a word. \"A huge thanks to the Australian, Chinese and French teams that helped extricate us from the ice field,\" said Chris Turney, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales and the leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition aboard the Shokalskiy. \"And, of course, the Russian team who were truly outstanding and we hope to see them again soon in New Zealand, when the Shoklaskiy finally breaks free.\"</p><p>Doyle told us it had been a relief to get all of the Shokalskiy's passengers on board his ship safely.</p><p>He also explained why so many ships had had so much trouble getting through the ice to the Russian-operated vessel.</p><p>\"It was just so thick, it was well outside our parameters,\" he said. \"When we tried to reach the Shokalskiy there was just nowhere for us to push the ice. It became a very hard task to grind it down and we didn't have the fuel or the time to do that.\"</p><p>The 90m-long, 10,000-horsepower Aurora Australis is rated to move through ice that is 1.3m thick, with 20cm of snow on top, at approximately two knots. Much of the ice around the Shokalskiy was many years old, more than three metres thick with a metre or more of snow on top. In addition, the snow was very damp because of the recent rain in the area, making it sludgy. \"It slows us down and takes a lot of the punch out of us when we're trying to break ice,\" he said.</p><p>According to Turney, our ship got stuck because thick, old ice that had been stuck to the Antarctic continent had been blown off the coastline and driven by winds and currents to the location where the Shokalskiy was sailing. When the winds pushed it against the continent, it pinned our ship in place. \"Coming out to the Aurora Australis and seeing the huge blocks of ice that reached the horizon makes you realise what an enormous event this blowout of ice must have been,\" he said.</p><p>When the new passengers had been shown to their cabins and with the sun setting, the Australian icebreaker began moving. It was a strange feeling, after a week of steadiness, to be swaying and swinging again in water.</p><p>From the ship's impressive bridge, we could see how extraordinarily deep the ice was. As it lolled and lumbered through the ice floes, the ship slowly widened cracks and crumbled off bits of the unending white ice field ahead, creating around it a debris path of huge white boulders floating in the water. The ice sheet itself extended many metres under the surface and the rubble created around it by the icebreaker looked like giant white soap bubbles foaming at the surface of the cold sea.</p><p>The next step for the Aurora Australis is to head east and towards open water, about 10 nautical miles through the ice from where it picked up the Shokalskiy's passengers. Once there, it will be given instructions by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) on where to go next.</p><p>The ship had been halfway through its re-supply of the Australian Antarctic base, Casey, when it was called on to help the Shokalskiy. \"At the moment, if we get back to Casey and complete the programme there, we can get back to Hobart and be on time to depart for the next voyage pretty much on time,\" said Doyle.</p><p>In his 17 years of working on the Aurora Australis, helping the passengers of the Shokalskiy has been Doyle's first rescue. He said assisting people in distress was \"part of the programme\" for people working in Antarctica.</p><p>\"You have to rely on each other if something goes wrong,\" he said. \"You're too far away from anything else, it's only the people here you can really rely on.\"</p>","headline":"Antarctic rescue: free at last!","trailText":"<p>The Guardian's <strong>Alok Jha</strong> gives a first-hand account of the moment a helicopter rescued the passengers of the Shokalskiy</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388693119297/Helicopter-on-ice-003.jpg","wordcount":"1510","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426166528","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8509967","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alok Jha, science correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2020550","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-05T20:06:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/02/antarctic-rescue-shokalskiy-free","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/02/antarctic-rescue-shokalskiy-free","tags":[{"id":"science/antarctica-live","webTitle":"Antarctica live","description":"Full interactive and multimedia coverage as the Guardian joins the 2013-2014 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which commemorates the centenary of the first AAE led by Sir Douglas Mawson","type":"blog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/antarctica-live","references":[]},{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alokjha","webTitle":"Alok Jha","rcsId":"GNL006494","r2ContributorId":"15338","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749328301/AlokJha.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733049/AlokJha.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alok Jha is a science correspondent at the Guardian.

   </video><p>The Australian icebreaker, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/30/antarctic-rescue-mission-australian-icebreaker-forced-back-by-blizzard\" title=\"\">Aurora Australis, was thwarted on Monday</a> in its initial attempts to reach the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, the scientific research vessel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/26/stuck-in-antarcticas-white-christmas\" title=\"\">stuck in sea ice off the coast of Antarctica since Christmas Day</a>. It will now wait for better weather before making a further attempt to cut through the thick pack ice around the Shokalskiy.</p><p>The Aurora Australis arrived at the edge of the sea ice surrounding the Shokalskiy – 20 nautical miles from the Russian-operated ship – in the early hours of 30 December, local time. Its attempt to cut through had to be called off soon after, due to poor visibility caused by the overnight build-up of snow and fog.</p><p>\"The Aurora has tried coming in and got a little way into the pack ice, about two nautical miles, but because visibility was so low and the pack was so thick, it decided it was more sensible to go back out to open water and it has done so, as has the Chinese icebreaker vessel, the Xue Long,\" said Chris Turney, leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE). The Aurora Australis is now waiting 22 nautical miles south-east of the Shokalskiy.</p><p>The weather in the area warmed up on Monday, although it has remained windy and visibility has not improved enough for another attempt by the Australian icebreaker.</p><p>\"The next thing is to wait for the weather to clear a bit so that the Aurora Australis can see its route through, to see the <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/leads.html\" title=\"\">leads</a> and gaps where you might be able to best attack the sea ice,\" said Turney. \"If that fails, we're looking at the possibility of a helicopter evacuation of at least the science expedition and its members, though the crew will probably stay onboard.\"</p><p>The evacuation would probably take place using the Xue Long's helicopter, which would land on helipads cleared out on the ice floes next to the Shokalskiy and the Aurora Australis.</p><p>Another option for rescue lays with the huge American icebreaker, the Polar Star, which is currently en route to the Ross Sea from Seattle. It had been due to travel via Sydney but it has now been ordered to sail directly to its final destination. If it was called upon to assist in the rescue effort, it could get to the sea ice edge near the Shokalskiy in eight or nine days.</p><p>There is no fixed timeline for the next steps, said Turney, while the captains of the Shokalskiy, Aurora Australis and the Xue Long waited for good weather. The forecast for the next few days, however, looks like there will be more of the same: snow, wind and heavy cloud.</p><p>AAE glaciologists on board the Shokalskiy, meanwhile, have been examining satellite images of the ice build-up over the past week to try and understand why the Shokalskiy got stuck.</p><p>\"It's remarkable just how much change there's been,\" said Turney. \"The ice that's packed around us is many years old, some is more than 10 years old.\"</p><p>The multi-year sea ice surrounding the Shokalskiy is much thicker and stronger than the new, first-year sea ice because it has had years of snowfall on top and freezing underneath.</p><p>According to the satellite maps, this ice was on the east side of the Mertz glacier until this past week, stuck fast to the land. Possibly because of a storm, or some other weather factor, this \"fast ice\" broke off and was blown into the area in which the Shokalskiy was sailing. Multi-year ice is a lot more difficult to cut through than single-year ice, which was the sort of material the Shokalskiy came through on its way into Antarctica.</p><p>\"It wasn't just a freak storm we were caught in,\" said Turney. \"It was a massive blowout of sea ice that trapped us.\"</p><p>The fast ice was partly in the area because of the huge iceberg, B09B. This broke away from the Antarctic continent in 2010, collided with and snapped off the extended part of the Mertz glacier, and then grounded itself in the entrance to Commonwealth Bay. Since then, the sea ice that would normally have formed and blown out to sea has instead been blocked by B09B and frozen into place.</p><p>Given the recent reorganisation of the ice around the Mertz glacier, glaciologists aboard the Shokalskiy think the ship might have become inadvertently caught in the formation of a new area of fast ice, which could stay in place for several years.</p><p>When it got stuck last week, the Shokalskiy was just over two weeks into its month-long journey, from Bluff in New Zealand to Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/04/douglas-mawson-antarctic-trek\" title=\"\">following in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson</a>. He led the original AAE of 1911, and the modern incarnation intended to repeat his wildlife, ocean and weather observations to build a picture of how this part of the world had changed over the past 100 years.</p><p>The Shokalskiy has around 50 passengers – including scientists and paying members of the public – and 20 crew on board. It became stuck in the ice near Cape de la Motte in East Antarctica, around 1,500 nautical miles from Hobart in Tasmania, after strong blizzards hit the vessel on Christmas Eve.</p>","headline":"Antarctic rescue mission fails to reach trapped ship","trailText":"Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis plans to try again in better weather as snow, fog and thick ice force it back <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/30/antarctica-live-video-diary-trapped-ice-missing-milkshake-video\" title=\"\">Video diary from Guardian writers stuck on board the ship</a>","newspaperPageNumber":"18","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/29/1388295395865/762f6843-7836-48a1-9e2d-9daa1568fdca-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"858","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"425940299","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8499030","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alok Jha, science correspondent in Cape de la Motte, East Antarctica","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2019191","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-02T10:35:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/30/antarctic-rescue-mission-fails","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/dec/30/antarctic-rescue-mission-fails","tags":[{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"environment/poles","webTitle":"Polar regions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/poles","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alokjha","webTitle":"Alok Jha","rcsId":"GNL006494","r2ContributorId":"15338","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749328301/AlokJha.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733049/AlokJha.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alok Jha is a science correspondent at the Guardian.

rotor blades of the helicopter made so much noise that, once inside, it was impossible to hear anything else. Twelve of us, in full cold-weather gear, had picked our way carefully across a snow-covered ice field and climbed into the windowless compartment at the back of the aircraft. We squashed ourselves against the walls, the remaining space jammed with luggage and cargo boxes. The two back doors slid shut and the helicopter, fully laden, lifted into the air.</p><p>Over the pilot’s shoulder, we craned our necks to glimpse the stacked and tumbled ice below, stretching to the horizon in all directions. We had been stuck here, off the coast of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, for more than a week. Several icebreakers had tried and failed to break a path to our ship, the Akademik Shokalskiy, but seeing the endless field of compressed ice from above, and the seemingly tiny Shokalskiy embedded within it, brought  the situation into a whole new focus. For many of us, it played on our minds that we were leaving behind the Shokalskiy and its crew, our friends, to an uncertain fate.</p><p>This ship had been our home for almost a month.

The Akademik Shokalskiy left port in Bluff, at the southernmost tip of New Zealand, on a sunny Sunday afternoon and within hours the Southern Ocean was tossing it from side to side at alarming angles.

Here, the Southern Ocean is uninterrupted by land for its entire circumference around the Earth, allowing winds to circulate freely and build to phenomenal speeds. The first evening at sea, many passengers were missing at dinner, lying in their bunks, dipping in and out of waves of nausea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/akademik-shokalskiy-cinemagraph-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051268\"                data-video-name=\"MV Akademik Shokalskiy - cinemagraph\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512375624/Shokalskiy-Cinemagraph-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430900358\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512359660/Shokalskiy-Cinemagraph-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/28//ShokalskiyCinograph.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/27/ShokalskiyCinograph/ShokalskiyCinograph.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/28/ShokalskiyCinograph_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The MV Akademik Shokalskiy crosses the Southern Ocean as it makes its way towards East Antarctica as part of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On board were 22 Russian crew members and 52 passengers, part of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013 (AAE); half of these were scientists, half members of the public who had paid around A$18,000 (£9,700) to work as science assistants on the journey south. The Shokalskiy’s destination, 10 days away, was Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica, a historic part of the continent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/04/scientists-antarctic-explorer-douglas-mawson\">first visited a century ago by the great British-Australian explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson</a>. A contemporary of Shackleton, Amundsen and Scott, Mawson led the original AAE in 1911. The modern expedition, led by University of New South Wales climate scientist <a href=\"http://www.christurney.com/\">Chris Turney</a>, intended to follow in his footsteps and <a href=\"http://www.spiritofmawson.com/the-science-case/\">record how this remote part of the world has changed in the past 100 years</a>; it would look at the impact of climate change on animal populations and on the temperature and saltiness of the sea. I was invited along to report the journey, with film-maker Laurence Topham: too often, journalists see only the results of work that has taken years to produce, missing the many twists and turns, and the humanity of how science is really done.</p><p>The scientists began their observations, with help from the volunteers, as soon as the sea-sickness subsided. They counted bird populations from the bridge, to monitor how the species changed as we progressed south. Oceanographers spent a 40-hour stint throwing hi-tech probes overboard at regular intervals to measure the temperature and saltiness of the ocean. Ecologists looked for seals to work out what they were eating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/antarctica-map-shokalskiy\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051294\"                data-video-name=\"Map: Shokalskiy's route from New Zealand to East Antarctica\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513670529/Antarctica-map-A-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430902295\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513666617/Antarctica-map-A-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Map: Alex Purcell</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we sailed farther south, the water and air got colder, the ship felt more alone in the rolling sea and the days got longer until, eventually, the sun never left the sky. The passengers, strangers at first, got closer as they swapped stories and took part in lectures, talked about their lives back home and shared meals in the two small dining rooms.</p><p>Antarctica imposed itself into this tight-knit world one morning when we awoke to calm seas and a series of loud bangs, sounding worryingly like explosions, coming from the bow of the ship. Stepping on to the foggy deck, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/23/antarctica-penguins-icebergs-coast-video\">we saw brilliant white chunks of ice</a>, some the size of football pitches, surrounding the ship. “You go from rolling open water to suddenly calm, almost serene, broken floes of ice, like shattered glass,” Turney says. “And as you break and weave your way through, everything is so quiet.”</p><p>Making our way through the floes, we spotted small groups of <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/birds/adelie-penguin/\">Adélie</a> and <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/birds/emperor-penguin/\">Emperor</a> penguins, which showed a passing interest in our ship before turning away or sliding off the ice and into the water. As the ship crunched and ground its way along, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/16/antarctica-live-iceberg-akademik-shokalskiy-video\">we saw our first iceberg</a> materialise from the haze like a developing photograph. Tens of metres high, hundreds of metres long, this mass of ice dwarfed our vessel. Sailing alongside one edge, we saw that its surface, perfect white from a distance, was lined with crevasses and pitted with caves, out of which glowed an electric blue light.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/feb/27/penguin-cinemagraph-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051272\"                data-video-name=\"Adélie penguins of Antarctica - cinemagraph\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512713521/Penguin-Cinemagraph-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430900563\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393512708240/Penguin-Cinemagraph-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/27/PenguinCinemagraph/PenguinCinemagraph.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/28/PenguinCinemagraph_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/28//PenguinCinemagraph.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>Harsh, savage and unpredictable</h2><p>What looked to me like an office block had to previous explorers conjured castles and cathedrals. Ben Maddison, a historian and Antarctic veteran making his tenth journey south on the Shokalskiy, told me, “In the middle of the 19th century, gothic sensibilities started to creep into explorers’ accounts – seeing in the shapes of the ice the ruins of civilisation, collapsed buildings, cathedrals, minarets. I love the way the ice has always reflected contemporary concerns, culture and perceptions.”<br></p><p>The Shokalskiy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/17/end-world-antarctica-expedition-douglas-mawson\">reached the edge of the ice at Commonwealth Bay</a> on an azure-skied afternoon, eight days after leaving port. Out on deck, it was incongruously warm. Icebergs glittered on the sea behind us; ahead rose mountains and the dome of the polar icecap. The captain dropped anchor and, after the scientists had unloaded their equipment and checked that the surface was safe to walk on, we were allowed down the gangplank.</p><p>There are a lot of things to get used to the first time you spend any time in Antarctica. The vistas of tumbled ice, for example, that look like Martian landscapes and which you have to continually remind yourself are part of the same planet on which you have grown up. The sheer distance you can see in every direction and gigantic scale of the mountains and walls of ice. The total absence of plants. The sensory disorientation that comes with true silence, no natural smells and the endless white of the ice that often bleeds into the sky.<br></p><p>All of these details, however, are just the veneer of beauty that overlays Antarctica. The continent is, above all, harsh, savage, and unpredictable. It is an extreme place that is uninhabitable and which cannot be bent to fit the needs of its visitors.</p><p>We stayed close to the ship that evening, entranced by penguins waddling around the edge of the sea ice. We arrived back, exhilarated, well after midnight. With the sun so high and bright in the sky, and no sign of tiredness in any of the group, it might as well have been midday.</p><p>Nobody owns Antarctica. Since 1961, <a href=\"http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm\">the Antarctic Treaty</a> has bound its signatories (more than 50 at the last count) to using the continent only for peaceful purposes, with the priority being scientific research (no disposal of nuclear waste, no military exercises, no weapons testing). “It’s one of the few places where there haven’t been military flare-ups,” says John Shears, head of operations at the British Antarctic Survey. “Even during the Falklands war, there were friendly relations between British and Argentine bases here.” And even as more countries have signed up and commercial activities such as fishing and tourism have expanded, territorial claims have stayed in the background. Instead countries will quietly assert themselves by building more bases: the US has six, the UK two, Australia three and China four.</p>  <blockquote><p>Oceanographers found the water under the sea ice was less salty than a century ago. This could have an impact on climate all over the world</p></blockquote>  <p>A week after arriving at the Antarctic coast, the Shokalskiy’s passengers were out on the Hodgeman Islands, a scrap of land bound by 10km of ice. The ship had dropped anchor at Cape de la Motte and the AAE members were being ferried by boat and all-terrain vehicles to the islands, so they all got a chance to walk on the Antarctic continent itself. The week had been eventful, the highlight being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/20/sea-ice-mawsons-huts-antarctica\">two successful journeys by small teams across 65km of ice</a> to carry out research and conservation work on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/gallery/2013/dec/23/inside-douglas-mawsons-antarctic-base-in-pictures\">Douglas Mawson’s huts at Cape Denison</a>. No one had thought that journey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/23/longest-drive-sea-ice-antarctica\">two years in the planning</a>, would be possible until the AAE team carefully picked their way through the tumbled, melting ice field, on vehicles that were, in essence, boats with wheels.</p><p>The oceanographers found that the water under the sea ice at Commonwealth Bay was less salty than a century ago. This shift could have major implications for how water and heat move around the world’s oceans. Global currents are driven by cold, salty water descending to the depths and pulling in warmer water from the equator; a change at the poles could have an impact on climate all over the world, way into the future. Ornithologists also found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2013/dec/24/the-penguins-of-cape-denison\">big changes in the penguin populations</a> near Mawson’s huts, a result of local changes in climate. The colonies were scattered and silent, littered with dead chicks and abandoned eggs.</p><p>The excursion to the islands would be our last stop on the continent before we began the long journey home. In the evening, however, it became clear that something was not quite right. “The ice was closing quickly around us and throughout that night the captain fought very hard to get the vessel out into open water,” says Greg Mortimer, AAE’s head of logistics and a veteran of more than 100 visits to Antarctica. “But he couldn’t: there was too much ice closing in, like a big vice.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c15ec8a6-bab3-460d-97e3-9f48bffd08a9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526136579/132482c5-4d30-45b7-aefd-5a057bcd265e-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The Shokalskiy icebound in Antarctica.

The following morning, Christmas Eve, brought an unexpectedly peaceful scene: the ship was surrounded, unable to move. From the bridge, Mortimer says, they could see open water two or three nautical miles away.</p><p>We were around two miles from the Antarctic coast and 1,500 miles from Hobart, Tasmania. South-westerly winds were pushing thick ice floes against the continent, pinning the ship in place. We waited for the ice to open up: if the wind direction changed for even a few hours, it could create a lead through the ice.</p><p>On Christmas Day, however, the situation was worse, and the Shokalskiy was even farther from open water. The captain, Igor Kiselev, sent out a distress call, triggered by the movement of two nearby icebergs. As ice floes move, so does any ship within them, but icebergs move independently. “You see one that is 50m high but there’s probably 250m below the water,” Mortimer says. “An iceberg can go through pack ice as if it didn’t exist.”</p>  <blockquote><p>Scientists questioned the ship’s research aims: why had it ventured into an area of sea known to be prone to pack ice?</p></blockquote>  <p>The distress call was relayed to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) office in Canberra, whose emergency response division concluded that the weather conditions (0°C and winds of up to 90kph) and the possibility that the Shokalskiy might get damaged and lose heat or power was reason enough to warrant a rescue. Amsa issued a broadcast to local shipping on Christmas morning. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long (”Snow Dragon”) and French vessel L’Astrolabe were the first to say they would come to our aid. “I felt it was our duty to come to the place as quick as we could,” says Wang Jianzhong, captain of the Xue Long since 2010 and a 19-year veteran of the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/poles\">polar regions</a>. His ship was on its way to build a new base on the Antarctic coast but he agreed to divert towards the Shokalskiy, then 600 nautical miles away. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis, which was several days away resupplying <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/stations/casey\">Casey</a>, the Australian Antarctic base, was also asked to assist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2014/feb/22/antarctica-map-rescue-operation\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2051293\"                data-video-name=\"Antarctica map: international rescue operation\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513533101/Antarctica-map-B-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430901960\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/27/1393513512005/Antarctica-map-B-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/27/AntarcticaMapB-16x9.mp4\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Map: Alex Purcell</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the Shokalskiy, one of the paying passengers, Adelaide-based Terry Gostlow, remembers a stunned silence after we were told about the distress call: “I knew enough about how far we were from anywhere to know this was a serious situation. A chill went through me.” But as the passengers settled into waiting mode, “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/31/new-year-2014-board-akademik-shokalskiy-video\">the mood became almost jovial</a>, as we found things to do and got a calendar of events going. It was quite boisterous, considering the situation we were in.”</p><p>Two days later, the Shokalskiy had its first radio contact with the Xue Long, 40 miles away. “Several hours later, we saw Xue Long out of the mist on our horizon,” Mortimer says. “That was a fantastic moment, because it humanised the situation. We weren’t just a radio call – all of a sudden we were humans there, stuck on a ship.”</p><h2>Out on deck that evening, we watched the Xue Long, a red dot on the horizon. “It was making great progress,” Turney says. “It was pushing through, coming towards us, and I was thinking, gosh, with any luck it could be here by morning.”</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/27/antarctic-mission-icebreaker-delay-rescue\">Next morning, though, the Xue Long was still a dot</a>. “The visibility was very poor,” Captain Wang says. “The sea ice became more and more dense – it was very difficult for us to break it.” By now, L’Astrolabe had arrived at the ice edge, but its icebreaking capability was even less than Xue Long’s. With both icebreakers unable to reach the ship, the Shokalskiy would have to wait for the Aurora Australis, still several days away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cf84da82-be8f-408d-805a-d390f76e65db\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526360934/3b139814-d489-49cf-9fd3-e0f41a338539-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunrise over the Shokalskiy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sunrise over the Shokalskiy</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>‘Our world was flipped on its head’<br></h2><p>Meanwhile, the world’s media had picked up on the story. What began as a few interview requests from New Zealand and Australian radio stations soon multiplied into interest from all over the world. For eight days after Christmas, there was a near-continuous demand for updates and interviews, particularly from US networks. <a href=\"http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/02/anderson-kathys-craziest-new-years-eve-moments/\">On New Year’s Eve, we broadcast live to CNN’s news anchor Anderson Cooper</a>, streaming footage from the top deck of the Shokalskiy to Times Square in New York. <br></p><p>There was controversy, too: <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-question-rescued-polar-expedition-1.14510\">scientists questioned the AAE’s research aims</a> and asked why the ship had ventured into an area of sea known to be prone to pack ice. They argued that the scientific work being carried out by the Australian, French and Chinese icebreakers, all diverted to help the Shokalskiy, <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">would be significantly affected</a>. By the time the Aurora Australis arrived at the edge of the ice field, every move was being tracked by news reporters around the world.</p><p>In that time, another 20 nautical miles of ice had blown in between us and open water. After more than a day of battling against it, the master of the Aurora Australis, Murray Doyle, decided he would not be able to get his ship anywhere near the Shokalskiy: the ice was too thick and he had neither the fuel nor the time to break it.</p><p>“Once again, our world was flipped on its head,” said Mortimer. It soon became clear that the only way to get people off the Shokalskiy as soon as possible would be to use the Xue Long’s helicopter, called the Xue Ying (which translates as “Snow Eagle”), to take people onto the Aurora Australis.</p><p>Mortimer, liaising with the Chinese and Australian captains from the bridge of the Shokalskiy, took the whole day on January 2 for the pieces to fall into place and for the rescue to begin.</p><p>There would be five helicopter flights from the Shokalskiy to the Aurora Australis, each with 12 passengers and as much luggage and scientific equipment as they could cram in. Captain Kiselev decided that he and the Russian crew of the Shokalskiy would remain on board and await further icebreaker assistance to get his ship out of the ice. There were 22 crew members who stayed on board. The passengers shook hands with some of the sailors who were helping us out, and with parting hugs, we wished each other luck.</p><p>Ben Maddison’s job that day was to safely guide the groups of 12 passengers from the Shokalskiy for each flight, across the ice and onto the helicopter. “The power of the [helicopter] was enormous. It’s like the whole air was vibrating with the wash of those two rotors,” he says. “We were walking through snow that was, in places, a metre or so deep and people were plunging up to their knees or further into the snow. Doing that amidst a very significant down draft, with ice crystals blowing into your face and a powerful noise - added up to an intimidating environment for most people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4cb09ff3-6de5-4358-87f9-8d29bc2c3660\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526706516/026f5c2c-36c3-48ee-8ae4-d39aa469c720-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Passengers prepare to evacuate by helicopter\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Passengers prepare to evacuate by helicopter</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mortimer was on the last flight, six hours after the rescue began. He says the ice he saw was “phenomenal. It was huge, multi-year-old, under extreme pressure, so that the edges of the floes had crumpled into towers as they bashed together. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/gallery/2014/jan/22/passengers-rescued-antarctic-hobart-pictures\">There was virtually no channel of open water between us and the Aurora Australis</a>.” <br></p><p>It took the Shokalskiy and the Xue Long another week to break free, as they waited for the wind to turn and open up leads in the ice. The Shokalskiy arrived safely back in Bluff on 14 January.</p><h2>‘We were in the wrong place at the wrong time’<br></h2><p>Though their summer programme has been delayed, the Chinese crew were celebrated at home for their role in our rescue. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\">President Xi Jinping</a>, <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/202936/8503460.html\">who reportedly kept a close eye on the ship’s progress</a>, has previously said that China needs to be ready to take advantage of the resources in the polar regions. The country is building a second icebreaker, bigger than the Xue Long, to expand its activities; Xue Long is scouting locations for a fifth Chinese base at Terra Nova Bay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6be53551-1ac2-4b64-bd90-a21b817e0f0c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393526868836/c28fd4ec-d520-4553-b813-0118201b311d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunset on the helipad of the Aurora Australis\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Passengers on the helipad of the Aurora Australis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There are obvious political reasons why people are interested in the Antarctic region,” says Mike Sparrow, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.scar.org/\">Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research</a>. “Part of it is to be seen as a global player – people want to be a member of a lot of these international treaties.” India, Russia, Japan, Germany and many others maintain interests here. The <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/environmental_issues/environmental_protocol.php\">Madrid Protocol</a>, signed in 1991, bans mining or other exploitation of the environment; but the protocol is due for renegotiation in 2048 – and as the technology to drill around the continent becomes available, it’s far from clear that its signatories will maintain the ban.</p><p>What caused the massive breakout of old ice from the edge of the continent, which moved and trapped the Shokalskiy, is still unclear. “We’re looking at the satellite information, we’re working with colleagues in Germany and elsewhere to try and get a feeling for what happened there,” says Turney. “Whatever it was, something happened which mobilised this massive amount of very old thick ice, and then basically caught us and then built up progressively over the next 40 hours.”</p><p>But for veterans, the unexpected nature of Antarctica is part of life there. “We were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Mortimer says. “We were not in that situation irresponsibly; we were in that situation wittingly. And we have dealt with it extraordinarily well, with ship, crew and passengers sane and healthy. It’s hard, sitting in your lounge, in a gentle part of the world, to understand the forces that are at work. But they’re much bigger than puny human efforts. They have been in the past, and they will be in the future.”</p>","headline":"Rescue from Antarctica","trailText":"After a month aboard a Russian research ship, <b>Alok Jha</b> and <b>Laurence Topham</b> found themselves trapped in the grip of the ice – and an international row over whether the expedition should have been there in the first place<br>","newspaperPageNumber":"52","shouldHideAdverts":"true","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393525212570/556d4089-13c5-478f-aab3-4c04690ee0c3-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"3359","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"430920864","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"530f7d77e4b01bd15abf322d","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Report: Alok Jha, video and photographs: Laurence Topham","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2051489","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-03T09:00:15Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2014/feb/28/-sp-rescue-from-antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/antarctica-live/2014/feb/28/-sp-rescue-from-antarctica","tags":[{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/science","references":[]},{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"science/antarctica-live","webTitle":"Antarctica live","description":"Full interactive and multimedia coverage as the Guardian joins the 2013-2014 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which commemorates the centenary of the first AAE led by Sir Douglas Mawson","type":"blog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/antarctica-live","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alokjha","webTitle":"Alok Jha","rcsId":"GNL006494","r2ContributorId":"15338","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749328301/AlokJha.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733049/AlokJha.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alok Jha is a science correspondent at the Guardian.

A key area for the world’s climate and wildlife, it is, for now, also a place of unparalleled international co-operation and negligible commercial exploitation. It has enjoyed  more than a century of peace, since explorers first discovered it. </p><p>But the Antarctic is also a place of great danger, a remote location where humans are almost never in control, where nature’s rule is absolute. On Friday, making exploration of this part of the world safer is high on the agenda of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Its members will come together to discuss the adoption of a polar code to ensure that expeditions to the extremities of the world abide by a set of technical and operational standards. </p><p>Fresh in the minds of those attending will be the stranding of the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, a Russian research vessel that was trapped in the ice off East Antarctica for 10 days over Christmas and the new year, with more than 70 people on board, while operating an expedition for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE). A series of icebreakers tried, and failed, to break a path to free the stricken ship and this international rescue effort – five nations working together amid the harshest conditions in one of the most isolated areas on Earth – caught the world’s attention. The story led TV news bulletins and filled newspaper front pages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ddc2af3e-f659-4a6d-bddd-d3bb71704061\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393532456759/8d2d4b03-b6a4-49c3-9930-c5768c57121d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Guardian journalists Alok Jha and Laurence Topham observe the stranded Akademik Shokalskiy in East Antarctica\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Guardian journalists Alok Jha (right) and Laurence Topham observe the stranded Akademik Shokalskiy in East Antarctica. Photograph: Andrew Peacock/Rex</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Akademik Shokalskiy incident has exposed differences in the scientific community; some researchers criticised the expedition as a glorified tourist trip that had seriously dented real scientific research in the region. The event also highlighted gaps in how expeditions to the Antarctic are permitted by national authorities.</p><p>At the heart of all the discussions are fundamental questions about who owns access to Antarctica and what activities should be allowed there, now and in the future.<br></p><p>Research programmes in the Antarctic are mostly controlled and supported by government-funded agencies, such as the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the British Antarctic Survey, which also maintain a network of permanent bases around the continent. But the summer AAE trip that the Guardian joined was not a typical scientific expedition to the polar region.</p><p>The Akademik Shokalskiy had 22 crew and 52 passengers, half of the latter group being scientists, the other half members of the public who had paid to go on the trip as science assistants. The AAE, led by Chris Turney, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, was funded from private sources, including the passengers on board, and the science case was built up and reviewed, over several years, by Turney and colleagues at UNSW.</p><p>Though the AAD assessed the environmental impact of Turney’s expedition, it had no role in funding or assessing its scientific goals. A century on from the first AAE, on which the British-Australian explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson visited and mapped large parts of East Antarctica for the first time, the new expedition aimed to record how this part of the world had changed in 100 years.</p><p>The private funding model is not a new one. During the heroic era of Antarctic exploration, led by Scott, Shackleton, Amundsen, Mawson and others, much of the money came from patrons. They also engaged public attention in newspapers and with images and films, to raise the money to explore the then unknown south.</p><p>But time has moved on from the era of the great explorers: the roots of the modern Antarctic era began half a century after the expeditions of Scott and Mawson. In 1957-58, scientists held the International Geophysical Year, the first serious effort to carry out a concerted programme of research on the continent. That led, in 1961, to the Antarctic Treaty – signed by 12 nations at first but now more than 50 – under which countries agreed to use the Antarctic regions only for peaceful and scientific purposes.<br></p><p>There were, and still are, territorial claims to the continent – from the UK, Argentina and Australia, among others – but none is officially recognised by the international community. In 1991, with the Madrid Protocol, the treaty expanded to include a ban on mining for minerals on the continent. Treaties, however, do not last forever. Nations are already positioning themselves for the long term, when they will be able to do much more on the continent than just scientific research.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-791993a6-c594-470f-9c03-f1fef841a967\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393532710410/70aa0233-cb1f-466e-9c60-88fea4d2165b-460x420.png\" alt=\"Map of Antarctic territorial claims\" width=\"460\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Map of Antarctic territorial claims.

This part of the world is important, for example, in understanding how the climate will change over the next century – around its coasts are the engines for many of the world’s ocean currents and there is enough ice sitting on the continent to add 60 metres to global sea levels, if it all melted.</p><p>“Along the [West] Antarctic peninsula, it’s one of the regions that’s warming quickest on the planet and there’s potential for a few metres of sea level there,” said Mike Sparrow, executive director of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. </p><p>Countries have maintained a permanent presence in Antarctica during the past half-century by building bases, in what is arguably the last colonial scramble on Earth. The US has six bases scattered around the continent, including one at the south pole. The UK has two bases, Australia has three and China has four. Maintaining a presence in Antarctica is a bit like having a space programme – it shows that a country is technologically advanced  and can project economic and political influence.<br></p><p>But carrying out work safely in this remote part of the world requires a rigorous planning and logistical operation. At the British Antarctic Survey, which is typical of many national Antarctic programmes, most scientific projects have a lead time of at least two years. Major projects involving several countries and many Antarctic locations could take five or six years of planning. Even the annual resupply of the main British bases, Rothera and Halley, is so logisitically complex that it requires ships to leave the UK in the autumn. </p><p>The James Clark Ross, primarily a scientific research vessel, leaves around September every year and the Ernest Shackleton, used mainly for cargo, leaves in November. “Both ships are full to the gunnels with fuel, food, cargo, scientific equipment,” said John Shears, head of operations and engineering at BAS. “We try and ship everything we need for all the stations and scientific field parties in the two ships.” By the beginning of April, which marks the end of the annual Antarctic summer season, the ships will have unloaded their cargo, finished their scientific work and begun the long journey back to the UK.</p><p>This resupply and work cycle is carefully planned and even slight disruptions, such as having to divert to rescue a ship in distress, can be a big problem. “It’s very intimately linked – operations, logistics and science programmes,” said Tony Fleming, director of the Australian Antarctic Division. “The ripple effect of any delay will magnify throughout the season.”</p><p>The Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in sea ice just over two weeks into its month-long voyage. After leaving the Antarctic coast on the evening of 23 December, the ship’s captain, Igor Kiselev, found his vessel surrounded by thick pack ice. It was far too dense for the ship to break through and, as the authorities would discover in the coming days, also too dense for even bigger icebreakers.</p><p>Kiselev issued a distress call on Christmas Day and the subsequent rescue effort, co-ordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Canberra, involved diverting icebreakers from the Chinese, French and Australian Antarctic programmes. After almost two weeks stuck in the ice, the ship’s passengers were evacuated by the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long’s helicopter, to the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7ba9edb6-e131-49f6-8f40-7965415cef02\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393533165564/4da9cddd-15fc-4ef4-bd36-781ecb9e0801-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Chinese helicopter crew evacuates passengers of Akademik Shokalskiy in Antarctica\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A Chinese helicopter crew evacuates passengers of Akademik Shokalskiy in Antarctica. Photograph: Laurence Topham for the Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the days after the rescue, many scientists criticised the AAE and its leaders for the impact they had had on the scientific research programmes of the nations that had gone to help them. Yves Frenot, director of the French Polar Institute, told Agence France-Presse that sending the French icebreaker L’Astrolabe to assist in the early stages had caused his scientists to scrap a two-week programme of oceanographic research. “But we are relatively lucky,” he said. “The Chinese have had to cancel all their scientific programme, and my counterpart in Australia is spitting tacks with anger, because their entire summer has been wiped out.”<br></p><p>The Aurora Australis was called to Commonwealth Bay to rescue the Akademik Shokalskiy’s passengers when it was halfway through the resupply of the Australian Antarctic base, Casey. “There was a programme looking at remediating soil [near Casey], so working on taking contaminants, historic contaminants out of the soil,” said Nick Gales, AAD’s chief scientist. “Another project looking at the effects of carbon dioxide on the animals and plants that live on the coastal ocean floor, and another project that looked at collecting the hydrography around the area, were all affected to various degrees by the delay.”</p><p>None of the critics of the AAE had any issues with the rescue itself – it is a principle of the law of the sea for ships to aid each other in times of distress.</p><p>“My personal feeling was that [the criticism] was perhaps because there was feeling that the [AAE] was claiming to be primarily a scientific expedition and I think that probably put some people’s noses out, particularly perhaps the Australian Antarctic Division,” Sparrow said.</p><p>Turney disputed the repeated claim that the AAE was not a scientific expedition. “Half the team were fulltime scientists, looking at the full range of natural and physical sciences, and they were going to be doing work almost from day one,” he said.</p><p>He pointed to a 40-hour series of observations of temperature and saltiness of the Southern Ocean, using hi-tech probes, around the Antarctic convergence – where the tropical seas give way to polar waters – made by oceanographers on the AAE. “That’s an amazing experiment – no one had actually done that in the Southern Ocean before, crossing a major ocean boundary.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87f75237-31d2-4f64-b595-2e23d44e4a77\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393533367893/288b132c-e625-4764-8615-d65cb6ccce80-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Professor Chris Turney, leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, talks to the media from the top deck of the stranded Akademik Shokalskiy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Professor Chris Turney, leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, talks to the media from the top deck of the stranded Akademik Shokalskiy. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the short term, arguments over whether or not the AAE was a scientific expedition will be settled by its outputs. Longer term, persuading the scientific community that projects not funded by national agencies can still do good science could be a long, uphill struggle.<br></p><p>On the logistical side, international authorities have also been rehearsing their thoughts on how to learn from the Akademik Shokalskiy incident. The AAD will issue a report about the rescue at the annual Antarctic Treaty meeting, due to be held in April in Brasilia. The issue under general discussion will be whether or not the permitting systems of different countries are robust enough to avoid incidents, such as the Akademik Shokalskiy’s, having such a big impact on their Antarctic programmes.<br></p><p>The Antarctic Treaty requires all expeditions to be authorised by government authorities but countries differ in how they implement the rules. For example, British citizens, planes or vessels going to Antarctica are assessed on environmental grounds, whether the expedition will be operated safely and if it is properly insured. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) adds that the UK examines whether or not a proposed expedition is self-sufficient, not just in terms of food and fuel but whether or not the people can get themselves out of trouble without relying immediately on help from a national Antarctic programme. <br></p><p>In contrast, the Australian system only looks at the environmental impact of a proposed expedition, not an expedition’s safety or self-sufficiency. The configuration of the AAE, which was not part of a national Antarctic programme but also not a tourist trip registered with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), was uncommon and it has tested the Australian authorisation system. The FCO said there will be pressure from other countries for Australian authorities to re-examine their procedures in light of the incident.</p><p>The Akademik Shokalskiy’s stranding demonstrated that, if something goes wrong on a country’s watch, it could have a significant scientific and financial impact. The AAD’s director, Tony Fleming, estimated the total cost of the rescue to be between A$1.8m and A$2.4m (£960,000-£1.29m) and he and government ministers have said in recent weeks that they will be doing their utmost to recover the money from the AAE and Akademik Shokalskiy’s insurers.</p><p>The IMO’s polar code is an important step in improving the safety of Antarctic expeditions. Agreeing new regulations, though, are always a delicate process, due to inevitable international sensitivities. When the Akademik Shokalskiy rescue was first formally discussed by the IMO, at a meeting on ship safety in January, there were rumbles of disagreement (albeit polite) between the Australian and Russian delegations.</p><p>The Russian delegation insisted that the Australians’ assessment of the ship’s predicament around Christmas – that there was a serious threat to both humans and the environment – had been too pessimistic. “The vessel was ready for this situation, including its equipment, housing and crew. And as subsequent events showed, almost immediately after the evacuation of passengers the weather changed, and favourable wind blew the ship on their own, without assistance proceeded to sea,” they argued in a statement. The ship broke free of the sea ice a few days after the passengers were evacuated and arrived in New Zealand on 14 January.</p><p>Disagreements like this are relatively tame, but they could be a sign of things to come. An increasing number of countries are asserting their presence in Antarctica and jockeying for political and economic power over the Earth’s last great wilderness.</p><p>Though the Xue Long got stuck in its attempt to rescue the Akademik Shokalskiy’s passengers, its subsequent helicoper evacuation of those on board was hailed a great success by political leaders back home. China has built up its presence in Antarctica quickly over three decades and shows no sign of slowing down – the Xue Long was on its way this year to scout locations for a new base, its fifth, at Terra Nova Bay, and a second icebreaker, bigger and more powerful than the Xue Long, has already been commissioned. President Xi Jinping is a supporter of exploration at the poles and wants China to be ready to exploit the ecomomic potential of these regions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c3d7c1a7-60e3-4fd7-b5d6-8ae094515a25\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393533528569/0b7d1c54-e102-469a-882f-dd955fd52c1e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The first sight of Chinese icebreaker Xue Long from the top deck of the Akademik Shokalskiy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The first sight of Chinese icebreaker Xue Long from the top deck of the Akademik Shokalskiy. Photograph: Laurence Topham</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Antarctic Treaty already allows some commercial activity as well as the scientific work – fishing is permitted in certain areas of the Southern Ocean and tourists can also visit the continent, as long as their expeditions are approved by their national Antarctic programmes.</p><p>But the rules will not last forever. Disagreements between countries about commercial rights to the continent are bound to increase in future, as the renewal date for the Madrid Protocol, due in 2048, approaches. The UK’s continuing diplomatic tensions with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, for example, are in no small part due to the countries’ overlapping claims to Antarctic territory.</p><p>In defiance of the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty, the UK made a submission to the United Nations in 2007 for sovereignty of around 1m sq km (386,000 sq miles) of sea bed off Antarctica; it is too difficult to extract any useful minerals from that area at the moment, but technological innovations and environmental changes due to climate change in the Southern Ocean could make drilling an economically viable activity within a few decades.</p><p>“Some fear that countries are subtly working to position themselves for that moment in 2048, when the consultative parties may let go of the Madrid Protocol,” wrote Danny Elias of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, an umbrella group for more than 150 NGOs with an interest in the polar region, on the <a href=\"http://antarcticablog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/mining-under-ice.html\">organisation’s blog</a>. “One need only look to China, which has already built four Antarctic research stations and has scouted the construction site for its fifth.”</p><p>AAE leader Turney said he had learned lessons but had not been discouraged from working on ways to bring private money to future research expeditions to Antarctica.  “The AAE was a science expedition, there were volunteers who had paid to go along. It is a different model of doing things but it would be disappointing for people to turn around and say, unless you’re government-logistically supported and/or government-funded completely, that you can’t do science. That would be a real shame.”</p><p>The scientists agreed there would be work to do in persuading the wider scientific community that the research aims of any future private expeditions were robust. Turney’s research team on the AAE was composed of scientists who were long-term researchers on climate research and he said the AAE’s science case had been built carefully. So he was surprised by the criticism from colleagues in the climate science community. To mitigate such criticisms in future, Turney suggess that private expeditions could seek endorsement from an independent scientific panel, perhaps overseen by a learned society, which ran in parallel with their logistical planning.</p><p>But whatever the problems of the Akademik Shokalskiy’s expedition, Turney said he believed funding science through public interest had big potential. “If we hadn’t got caught by that sea ice, and that was an extreme event, we’d achieved almost everything we’d set out to do,” he said. “And that’s the frustration because this model potentially works so well. There is an innate interest in Antarctica, and I believe an innate interest in science. And people want the excitement of going to this environment, where they can actually help and work, and I actually think working between the public and the scientists to actually fund research and expeditions is an incredibly exciting way of going forward.”</p><p>• This article was amended on 4 March 2014 to correct the attribution of a quote from a member of the  Antarctic and Southern Ocean
