He and his sister Linda were brought up by their mother, Lily, in a building with no electricity and a single \"decrepit\" toilet for all inhabitants.

On Wednesday, Orwell judge Sue MacGregor said it is \"a tale told with great grace and good humour, of what it was like growing up poor in a single-parent family in postwar Britain. It is at once deeply personal and nationally significant, and a highly engaging read.\" Robert McCrum and Trevor Phillips were the other judges.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/this-boy-alan-johnson-review\" title=\"\">In a Guardian review</a>, Chris Mullin judged This Boy \"the biography of a politician like no other\", saying that \"from time to time, one has to pinch oneself to recall that this is not an account of childhood in Victorian England, but of life in the England of the 1950s and 60s.\" Mullin added: \"Far from being a misery memoir, it is beautifully observed, humorous, moving, uplifting; told with a dry, self-deprecating wit and not a trace of self-pity.\"</p><p>At the Ondaatje prize ceremony, Johnson said he had set out to \"recapture north Kensington from Notting Hill\", as \"Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were not often seen down our way\". He added on Monday: \"People lived 16 in a house, but you were forced into a community, and [were] looking after people who couldn't look after themselves.\"</p><p>Johnson joins former Orwell

Fishing in Utopia was selected from a hugely eclectic shortlist which also included Hsiao-Hung Pai's undercover investigation into the lives of Chinese immigrants in Britain, Chinese Whispers, and Rashid Ahmed's examination of Islamic extremism, Descent Into Chaos.</p><p></p><p>\"We were simply all entranced by it. I can't put it any differently than that,\" said former Downing Street adviser and TLS editor Ferdinand Mount, who was one of this year's judges alongside author Geoffrey Wheatcroft, former editor of Granta Ian Jack and chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund Jenny Abramsky.</p><p></p><p>Fishing in Utopia is both a memoir of Brown's own life in Sweden – he lived there as a child, married a Swedish woman, worked in a timber mill and raised his own son in the country – and an exploration of the country's social and political system. Judges called it \"charming and crystalline\", and \"in its light and easy way ... as profound as it is enchanting\".</p><p></p><p>\"As well as being a marvellous book in itself, it does make you reflect on how hard it was for Sweden to transform itself into an industrial state,\" said Mount.</p><p></p><p>Detailing how Brown falls in love with Sweden, with its socialism and its fishing, and also exploring how the country loses some of its idealism as it becomes an industrial nation, Mount said that Fishing in Utopia had absolutely achieved George Orwell's ambition \"to make political writing into an art\".</p><p></p><p>\"There are many different ways of doing that,\" Mount said. \"Orwell himself chose many different forms of writing about the political scene. Chinese Whispers is in the tradition of Down and Out in Paris and London – going undercover and seeing what it's really like. Tony Judt's essay collection Reappraisals is in another tradition of Orwell – the long reflective essay on the issues of the day.\"</p><p></p><p>Mount said that Fishing in Utopia had been the unanimous choice for judges  with Mark Thompson's account of the Italian front during the first world war, The White War, coming in a narrow second.</p><p></p><p>Judt's Reappraisals, spanning the post-cold war period he terms \"the years the locusts ate\", was also a strong contender, but judges felt that Judt's work as a whole deserved special recognition and decided instead to bestow a prize for lifetime achievement on the acclaimed historian. Author of works including Postwar, a hugely acclaimed history of Europe since 1945, Judt is a \"politicologue\" and controversialist, said the judges, whose writing is distinguished by its \"intelligence, insight and conspicuous courage\".</p><p></p><p>\"If there is - in the best sense - an 'Orwellian' writer in our time, it's Tony Judt, and it is an honour to bestow honour upon him,\" they said. \"Although sometimes overshadowed by fiction and poetry, history and the essay are just as much branches of literature, and indeed of 'creative writing', and they have produced much of the best writing of our age. Even in a rich field of brilliant historians, the name of Tony Judt stands out.\"</p><p></p><p>Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn won the Orwell journalism prize for articles from the London Review of Books and The Independent. His book, Muqtada al-Sadr and the Fall of Iraq, had been longlisted for this year's book prize.</p>","headline":"Guardian journalist wins Orwell book prize","trailText":"Andrew Brown's Fishing in Utopia 'entrances' judges of Britain's pre-eminent award for political writing","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2009/4/22/1240415443368/Andrew-Brown-004.jpg","wordcount":"578","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"346313457","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"1925306","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alison Flood","internalPageCode":"1204025","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2009-04-25T18:50:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/22/orwell-prize-fishing-sweden","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2009/apr/22/orwell-prize-fishing-sweden","tags":[{"id":"books/orwellprize","webTitle":"Orwell prize","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/orwellprize","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/orwellprize","references":[]},{"id":"culture/awards-and-prizes","webTitle":"Awards and prizes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","references":[]},{"id":"books/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/politics","references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/HUM006"},{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/POL"}]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/HUM006"},{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/POL"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-346313509","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2009/4/22/1240415442065/Andrew-Brown-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Linda Nylind","altText":"Andrew Brown","height":"276","credit":"Linda Nylind","caption":"'Entrancing' ...

Orwellian attributes aplenty Tom Bingham's The Rule of Law and Afsaneh Moqadam's Death to the Dictator! were my top picks when judging this year's Orwell book prize","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-20T09:41:23Z","body":"<p>How much of an influence does George Orwell have on books being written today? Over the last few months, while judging this year's <a href=\"http://theorwellprize.co.uk/\" title=\"Orwell Book Prize\">Orwell book prize</a>, I've found myself repeatedly asking this question. While the prize doesn't require writers to slavishly imitate Orwell, it does stipulate that successful entries must display a number of Orwellian attributes, such as \"clarity\", \"intellectual courage\" and \"critical thought\". Above all, works should aspire to Orwell's ambition of \"turning political writing into an art\". So the question of Orwell's continuing influence, rather than idle speculation, was integral to the judging process. We were being asked to hold today's political writing up to an Orwellian standard, and assess it accordingly.</p><p>A number of things became clear. Firstly, Orwell continues to have a discernible influence on today's writing in terms of some types of book that are published. More than anyone else, he popularised the genre of immersive reportage, in works such as <a href=\"http://georgeorwellnovels.com/books/down-and-out-in-paris-and-london/\" title=\"Down and Out in Paris and London\">Down and Out in Paris and London</a> and <a href=\"http://georgeorwellnovels.com/books/the-road-to-wigan-pier/\" title=\"The Road to Wigan Pier\">The Road to Wigan Pier</a>, using it primarily to investigate poverty. This approach remains popular. My fellow judges and I read a number of books that start from the premise of going out into the world and actually doing something (rather than merely observing) and writing about the experience. Examples included Katherine Hibbert's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/6989289/Free-Adventures-on-the-Margins-of-a-Wasteful-Society-by-Katharine-Hibbert-review.html\" title=\"Free: Adventures on the Margins of a Wasteful Society\">Free: Adventures on the Margins of a Wasteful Society</a>, Charlie Carroll's <a href=\"http://www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk/books/DisplayBookInfo.php?ISBN=9781906308179\" title=\"On the Edge: One Teacher, A Camper Van, Britains Toughest Schools\">On the Edge: One Teacher, a Camper Van, Britain's Toughest Schools</a>, and Tim Butcher's (longlisted) <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/chasing-the-devil-the-search-for-africas-fighting-spirit-by-tim-butcher-2087658.html\" title=\"Chasing the Devil: The Search for Africas Fighting Spirit\">Chasing the Devil: The Search for Africa's Fighting Spirit</a>.</p><p>Secondly, and I think more problematically, Orwell continues to cast a long shadow over any book, whether fiction or non-fiction, that deals with the abuse of political power. Several entries felt superficially Orwellian in this respect, most notably Heather Brooke's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/01/steven-poole-review-nonfiction-choice\" title=\"The Silent State\">The Silent State</a>, about the increasing lack of accountability in British government, and Helen Dunmore's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/08/the-betrayal-helen-dunmore-review\" title=\"The Betrayal\">The Betrayal</a>,  set in Stalin's Russia during the early 1950s (and the only novel on the shortlist). Yet Orwell's influence in this regard is perhaps more bogus than real, the product of our tendency to extend the word \"Orwellian\" to any piece of writing that is concerned with sinister, shadowy forces and overweening state power. Certainly Brooke's and Dunmore's books, good as they are, don't bear much resemblance to anything Orwell actually wrote.</p><p>Thirdly, Orwell continues to make himself felt in terms of intellectual influence. Many of today's political writers regard Orwell as a touchstone: none more so than Christopher Hitchens, whose <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/29/hitch-22-christopher-hitchens-review\" title=\"Hitch-22\">Hitch-22</a> was on our shortlist. Orwell is Hitchens's hero, and in his memoir, he describes how he influenced his thinking and, indeed, his whole approach to journalism. But, once again, this doesn't mean that Hitch-22 is a particularly Orwellian book. Hitchens's writing, accomplished as it is, lacks the clarity and apparent simplicity of Orwell's; equally it is impossible to imagine Orwell writing a conventional biography replete with show-offy tales about his famous chums.</p><p>The final way in which Orwell influences today's writers is the hardest to describe, but to my mind the most important. Orwell's truly defining characteristic as a writer was surely stylistic, and had to do with the unflinching, rigorously honest quality of his prose. Reading him, you always feel that he is working things out for himself, proceeding in his arguments solely from his own observations, not from the received opinions that most writers rely on as a substitute for real thought.</p><p>This was the quality I most wanted to see in the books I read, and occasionally I found it – in, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/afsaneh-moqadam\" title=\"\">Afsaneh Moqadam</a>'s superbly unsparing account of a protester's capture and imprisonment during the Iranian upheavals of 2009, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7771496/Death-to-the-Dictator-Witnessing-Irans-Election-and-the-Crippling-of-the-Islamic-Republic-by-Afsaneh-Moqadam-review.html\" title=\"Death to the Dictator!\">Death to the Dictator!</a>. This book, largely overlooked on its release, was the single work I was most excited to discover. Our eventual winner, though, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/07/rule-of-law-thomas-bingham\" title=\"Tom Binghams The Rule of Law\">Tom Bingham's The Rule of Law</a>, which, in a different way, also displays a very Orwellian preparedness to cut to the heart of an issue that has immense importance across the world today.

Dunmore's The Betrayal is the first novel on the shortlist since Marina Lewycka's Two Caravans in 2008. A sequel to The Siege, The Betrayal tells the story of a young doctor and a nursery school teacher in Leningrad, as they struggle to avoid the authorities' attention.</p><p></p><p>It was selected by judges from a longlist of 18 titles, alongside Christopher Hitchens's memoir Hitch-22, the late judge Tom Bingham's examination of law The Rule of Law, journalist Oliver Bullough's history of the people of the Caucasus mountains Let Our Fame Be Great and DR Thorpe's life of Harold Macmillan, Supermac.</p><p></p><p>An eyewitness account of the 2009 Iranian election, Death to the Dictator! written by the pseudonymous Afsaneh Moqadam, was also shortlisted for the award. The author wrote the book under a pseudonym to protect their identity, having both witnessed and participated in many of the events the book describes.</p><p></p><p>\"There is a recurrent theme in this year's books, and it is very Orwellian: fear,\" said director of the prize Jean Seaton. \"For the first time we have had to seek to preserve the anonymity of an author, Afsaneh Moqadam on Iran, and from Dunmore's gripping novel about life in Stalin's Russia to Oliver Bullough on a previously unknown genocide, the horror of authoritarian power is displayed.\"</p><p></p><p>But Seaton said there was also an answering theme \"that cherishes the individual\" in this year's final selection of titles, \"from Tom Bingham's Rule of Law which lays out (for all societies) how law, not just written down but in practice, preserves liberty and order, to Thorpe's wonderfully humane biography of Macmillan, seamlessly weaving the personal and the affairs of state, to Christopher Hitchens's grand memoir, full of brilliant writing and sharp judgments brimming with a very particular life\".</p><p></p><p>The winner of the £3,000 award will be announced on 17 May, selected by a panel of judges that features Today presenter James Naughtie, Virago Press founder Ursula Owen and Observer books editor Will Skidelsky.</p><p></p><p>The Orwell prize 2011 shortlist:</p><p>The Rule of Law by Tom Bingham</p><p>Let Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus by Oliver Bullough</p><p>The Betrayal by Helen Dunmore</p><p>Hitch-22 by Christopher Hitchens</p><p>Death to the Dictator!

He and his sister Linda were brought up by their mother, Lily, in a building with no electricity and a single \"decrepit\" toilet for all inhabitants.

On Wednesday, Orwell judge Sue MacGregor said it is \"a tale told with great grace and good humour, of what it was like growing up poor in a single-parent family in postwar Britain. It is at once deeply personal and nationally significant, and a highly engaging read.\" Robert McCrum and Trevor Phillips were the other judges.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/this-boy-alan-johnson-review\" title=\"\">In a Guardian review</a>, Chris Mullin judged This Boy \"the biography of a politician like no other\", saying that \"from time to time, one has to pinch oneself to recall that this is not an account of childhood in Victorian England, but of life in the England of the 1950s and 60s.\" Mullin added: \"Far from being a misery memoir, it is beautifully observed, humorous, moving, uplifting; told with a dry, self-deprecating wit and not a trace of self-pity.\"</p><p>At the Ondaatje prize ceremony, Johnson said he had set out to \"recapture north Kensington from Notting Hill\", as \"Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were not often seen down our way\". He added on Monday: \"People lived 16 in a house, but you were forced into a community, and [were] looking after people who couldn't look after themselves.\"</p><p>Johnson joins former Orwell

You might have wanted to cheer twice last week. The reason to cheer – when things were happening in elections which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-hitlist-20-seats-commons\" title=\"\">didn't make you want to cheer</a> – was that a very nice, very bright man who also happened to be a politician had proved to the world that he was a very good writer indeed.</p><p>In the past week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/alan-johnson-wins-2014-orwell-prize\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson has won the Orwell prize</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/20/alan-johnson-mp-wins-ondaatje-prize-memoir-this-boy\" title=\"\">Ondaatje prize</a> for his memoirabout his childhood, This Boy. The Orwell prize is for books and journalism that \"make political writing into an art\". The Ondaatje prize is for the book that \"best evokes the spirit of a place\".</p><p>In This Boy, Alan Johnson does both. He makes you smell and see the streets of his Notting Hill childhood. He makes you feel the cold on a winter's night and taste the pie and mash. He also writes in the way that Orwell thought you should write: in language that's clear and true. Writers, said Orwell, should avoid cliches, jargon and \"pretentious Latinised style\" because \"language can corrupt thought\".</p><p>It's quite hard to imagine Alan Johnson ever using a \"pretentious Latinised style\". It's certainly hard to imagine him talking about things like \"predistribution\". This, after all, was the man who said, when he was made shadow chancellor, that he'd have to \"pick up a primer of economics for beginners\". He didn't mean he wasn't up to the job. Of course the man who had been home secretary was up to the job. When he talked about the \"economics primer\", he was just being himself: modest, warm and quite keen on something that used to be called a joke.</p><p>What you find when you read the book is a boy who falls in love with books, and music, and poetry, even though there was very little of any of it around. You find a boy who didn't think \"cost of living\" was a slogan, but something that meant you didn't eat.</p><p>What you don't find is a boy who grew up thinking that he'd quite like to be prime minister, and who thought that the best way to do that was probably by becoming a special adviser to a politician, but first going to Oxford and reading PPE.</p><p>This Boy makes you think it would be nice if the people who represented you had actually done a few things before they went into politics. It reminds you that youth and energy are lovely, of course, but that there's also something to be said for people who have been around. It makes you think that if Labour had a leader like Alan Johnson – if Labour had, in fact, a leader who <em>was </em>Alan<em> </em>Johnson – then next year's election might be a very different thing.</p><p>But the book also reminds you of a world that has gone. Alan Johnson grew up in houses shared with other families, with no electricity, no heating, no bathroom, no toilet, no washing machine, no phone and no fridge. The family's one luxury, a \"wireless\", was rented. His childhood, he says, was spent in \"an almost permanent state of hunger\". If his mother hadn't done the cleaning jobs that probably killed her, he and his sister would barely have eaten at all.</p><p>Hardly anyone in this country lives like that now. Hardly anyone has to share their home with other families. Hardly anyone has to use an outdoor loo. Most people now have heating, and fridges, and TVs, and phones. Most people – 83% of households, in fact – have internet access. Quite a few people think having a TV, computer and smartphone is a right.</p><p>If this isn't progress, I don't know what you'd call it. And this has happened because of politics. It's politics that has meant that people on low incomes don't share homes with other families, politics that has given people tax credits, income support and free school meals. Certainly, some people are struggling. Many of us will struggle, in this new globalised, digitised economy, to have the standards of living we had before. But even our new, lower standards of living are standards most people in the world would kill to have.</p><p>If people want to protest in elections, that's their democratic right. Most of us want more than we have. Politicians have encouraged us to expect that we'll get more than we have. Perhaps they shouldn't. Perhaps we shouldn't. Perhaps we should follow the rule that Alan Johnson's mother gave him, and which he quotes in his beautiful book.
