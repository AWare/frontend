Britain's national security council will discuss the crisis in special session next week.</p><p>It will include a review of the EU ban on providing weapons to all sides in Syria. Officials say that the embargo includes the principle of \"proportionality\" which suggests the restriction could be relaxed in the event of a humanitarian disaster.</p><p>Evidence of a British rethink on the crisis came on a day when rebels fired mortars at a presidential palace in Damascus and as different elements of the divided Syrian opposition met in the Qatari capital Doha to try to close ranks and form a transitional government for the post-Assad era.</p><p>In another indication of regional tensions, Turkey confirmed that it is to make an official request to Nato to station Patriot missiles along its border with Syria. The move follows several incidents of shelling across the 560-mile frontier. It could also be linked to the ideas of establishing a safe zone or no-fly zone in the border area.</p><p>The moves by Britain and Turkey both seemed to anticipate a bolder approach from Obama to end the conflict that has claimed an estimated 35,000 lives since the bloodiest of the Arab spring uprisings erupted in March 2011. On average 100 to 150 people now die every day.</p><p>The text of the EU embargo, agreed two months after the conflict began, says: \"By way of derogation … the competent authorities in the member states&nbsp;… may authorise the sale, supply, transfer or export of equipment which might be used for internal repression, under such conditions as they deem appropriate, if they determine that such equipment is intended solely for humanitarian or protective use.\"</p><p>Cameron made clear he believes that stage may have been reached after he visited the refugee camp, where 110,000 Syrians are sheltering. \"I think what I have seen and heard today is truly appalling,\"  said. \"I think [with] a re-elected president [Obama] with a new mandate&nbsp;… it's really important to discuss what more we can do to help resolve the situation.\"</p><p>Underlining the shift, the foreign office announced on Wednesday that it will talk to \"military figures in the armed opposition\" though it insists it has no plans to arm the rebels – the suspicion of those who fear a rerun of Nato's intervention in Libya last year.</p><p>Previously the Foreign Office had sanctioned contact only with \"political representatives of armed Syrian opposition groups\".</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, said in a statement to MPs that Britain would \"adhere to our clearly stated policy of only supplying non-lethal support to the unarmed opposition\".</p><p>But No 10 believes there is a mismatch in which the EU and the US provide only \"non-lethal\" help to the rebels while Russia and Iran provide resources and weapons to Syrian government forces.</p><p>It is understood that Britain may review the EU embargo as a tactical ploy to persuade the Russians and Chinese, who have pledged to veto any UN security council resolution, to change position.</p><p>The prime minister wants Britain's security council to examine the viability of creating safe havens, an idea championed by Turkey, and to assess whether Assad could be persuaded to stand down by the offer of safe passage to a third country.</p><p>Officials acknowledge that it would be difficult to secure such havens without imposing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria. This is deemed impossible because China and Russia would block such a move, which would be difficult to enforce in the face of Syria's powerful air force.</p><p>But Cameron said he was determined to act across a range of fronts. \"That means more help for the opposition, more pressure at the UN, more help for the refugees, more work with the neighbours but also a general sort of: 'Look let's be frank what we've done for the last 18 months hasn't been enough.' The slaughter continues, the bloodshed is appalling, the bad effects it's having on the region, the radicalisation but also the humanitarian crisis that is engulfing Syria. So let's work together on really pushing what more we can do, what other steps we can take to hasten the end of this regime.\"</p><p>The No 10 source said: \"Today is the moment the prime minister came and saw for himself what is happening. This is the moment to get some impetus going forward. We want to put everything on the table.\"</p><p>The main Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Council, discussed electing a new leader and executive committee on Wednesday. It and other groups will meet on Thursday to form a new 50-member civilian group that will later choose a temporary government for Syria and, western governments hope, improve coordination with armed groups.</p>","headline":"Call to lift Syria arms embargo to aid rebels","trailText":"UK to review EU ban after Cameron visits refugee camps as Turkey says it will ask Nato to put Patriot missiles along border","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/7/1352316389426/Syrian-rebel-fighter-thro-005.jpg","wordcount":"873","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"398999525","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6875351","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nicholas Watt in Amman and Ian Black, Middle East editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1825861","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-11T00:01:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/08/syria-arms-embargo-rebel","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/08/syria-arms-embargo-rebel","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Others argued the opposite, saying that arms supplies would only escalate the conflict.</p><p>Several countries – notably Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden – oppose it for fear that weapons may fall into the hands of Islamic extremist groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra. Germany has been trying to fashion a compromise.</p><p>Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, said he would try to \"build bridges\" at the meeting of EU foreign ministers, but consensus looked elusive, with participants delivering contradictory statements.</p><p>Both Westerwelle and Hague said the EU could fail to find a common position on the sanctions package that expires automatically on Friday unless there is agreement.</p><p>Hague added that if the negotiations collapsed, individual EU states would have to mount their own national sanctions against the Assad regime.</p><p>Britain and France have been pressing for a partial lifting of the arms embargo to the moderate sections of the Syrian opposition since November. Hague has argued that lifting the arms embargo would complement, rather than contradict, a peace process, since a militarily strengthened opposition could force President Bashar al-Assad to the negotiating table.</p><p>But Labour has questioned whether lifting the embargo would be legal or politically wise. \"How would the government prevent British-supplied weapons falling into the wrong hands, and how does supplying weapons help to secure a lasting peace?\" asked Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary.</p><p>\"Syria today is awash with arms and in the House of Commons this week, MPs on all sides expressed real concern about the identity, intent and tactics of some of the rebel forces.</p><p>\"In Washington, the prime minister clearly failed to convince President Obama of his case, so tomorrow in Brussels the UK's use of the veto would confirm that the prime minister had also failed to convince our European partners.\"</p><p>In Brussels, Turkey's foreign minister voiced strong support for the Anglo-French position. But last week in the US the White House strongly rebuffed Ankara for its hawkish position against Assad.</p><p>Oxfam's head of arms control, Anna Macdonald, said: \"Allowing the EU arms embargo to end could have devastating consequences. There are no easy answers when trying to stop the bloodshed in Syria, but sending more arms and ammunition clearly isn't one of them.</p><p>\"Transferring more weapons to Syria can only exacerbate a hellish scenario for civilians. If the UK and France are to live up to their own commitments – including those set out in the new arms trade treaty – they simply must not send weapons to Syria.\"</p><p>There were signs at the weekend that the Assad regime may attend an international peace conference in Geneva next month after the foreign minister, Walid al-Mouallem, said the meeting could present a \"good opportunity for a political solution for the crisis in Syria\". But he added: \"No power on Earth can decide on the future of Syria. Only the Syrian people have the right to do so.\"</p><p>The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, in Paris on Monday night to discuss the prospects for the meeting.</p><p>The UK-French attempt to lift the arms embargo has not been made any easier by the continued lack of unity within the rebel movement. Talks failed on Sunday to end a factional dispute over proposals to dilute Qatar's influence on rebel forces, with Saudi Arabia angling to play a greater role now that Iranian-backed Hezbollah is openly fighting for Assad.</p><p>Labour argued that the EU common position – an agreement that is usually a precursor to legislation – says member states must deny an export licence if there is a clear risk that the equipment may be used to commit violations of international humanitarian law or human rights.</p><p>The UN commission of inquiry in Syria reported in February that the rebels have committed war crimes, saying \"war crimes, including murder, extrajudicial killings and torture, were perpetrated by anti-government armed groups\".</p><p>UN security council resolution 2083 (2012) says all states shall take measures to prevent the direct or indirect supply of arms and related materiel to al-Qaida and other individuals and entities associated with them.

The vast majority of EU states opposed the shift, but assented in order to preserve a semblance of unified policy.</p><p>A meeting of EU foreign ministers descended into recrimination with a vast majority against lifting the arms embargo, but William Hague, the foreign secretary, blocked a compromise deal. Austria, the biggest opponent of the British aim, reacted bitterly, stating that the EU negotiations had collapsed and that the Europe-wide sanctions regime would collapse at midnight on Friday.</p><p>Hague sounded satisfied, however, although others said 25 of 27 EU governments opposed the Anglo-French policy.</p><p>\"EU nations agreed to bring the arms embargo on the Syrian opposition to an end. This was the outcome that the United Kingdom wanted. It was a difficult decision for some countries but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria,\" Hague said.</p><p>By contrast, the Austrian vice-chancellor and foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger, said the talks \"have failed … I'm a little annoyed … It's regrettable that we have found no common position.\"</p><p>He added that France joined Britain in demanding a lifting of the arms embargo, but that the other 25 were opposed.</p><p>The Dutch said that only two EU countries were thinking of supplying arms to Syria, meaning the UK and France. There was also agreement that Britain would not begin to deliver arms to the Syrian opposition before August, in order to gauge what might happen at the internationally sponsored peace talks in Geneva mooted for next month, although there is no certainty whether they will take place.</p><p>The long day of negotiations between the EU's 27 foreign ministers saw Britain and France opposing plans to shelve a decision on arming the opposition until August, while Austria and the Czech Republic spearheaded the opposition to the Anglo-French push, with the Czechs supporting the Israeli line against sending arms to Syria and the Austrians alarmed at the impact on their UN peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel.</p><p>Spindelegger said that Vienna would now have to reconsider its deployment on Golan. A withdrawal could see an Israeli rush to fill the UN vacuum, ratcheting up the tension in the region.</p><p>Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said Paris supported a decision that would maintain an EU consensus, but would allow \"the rebels to have the necessary arms and that the arms could be monitored\".</p><p>The foreign secretary, William Hague, joined the French in arguing that supplying arms to \"moderate\" opposition forces would lead to less killing in Syria. Others argued the opposite, that arms supplies would only escalate the conflict.</p><p>Several countries – notably Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden – opposed the decision for fear that weapons might fall into the hands of Islamic extremist groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra. Germany has been trying to fashion a compromise.</p><p>Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, said he would try to \"build bridges\", but consensus was elusive with participants delivering contradictory statements. Both Westerwelle and Hague had warned the EU could fail to agree a common position on the sanctions package, which was to expire automatically on Friday.</p><p>It appeared that Britain and France had received a green light to go ahead with supplying arms to the Syrian rebels. They have been pressing for a partial lifting of the arms embargo to the moderate sections of the Syrian opposition since last November. Hague has argued that lifting the arms embargo would complement, rather than contradict, a peace process since a militarily strengthened Syrian opposition can force the Syrian president, Assad, to the negotiating table.</p><p>Fabius returned early to Paris to meet John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, to try to organise Syrian peace talks in Geneva next month. No date has been set for the talks. It is not clear who will attend.</p><p>In Brussels, Turkey's foreign minister voiced strong support for the Anglo-French position. But last week in the US, Ankara was strongly rebuffed in its hawkish position against Assad by the White House.</p><p>Oxfam's head of arms control, Anna Macdonald, said: \"Allowing the EU arms embargo to end could have devastating consequences. There are no easy answers when trying to stop the bloodshed in Syria, but sending more arms and ammunition clearly isn't one of them.</p><p>\"Transferring more weapons to Syria can only exacerbate a hellish scenario for civilians. If the UK and France are to live up to their own commitments – including those set out in the new arms trade treaty – they simply must not send weapons to Syria.\"</p><p>The UK-French attempt to lift the arms embargo has not been made any easier by the continued lack of unity within the rebel movement. Talks failed on Sunday to end a factional dispute over proposals to dilute Qatar's influence on rebel forces, with Saudi Arabia angling to play a greater role now that Iranian-backed Hezbollah is openly fighting for Assad.</p><p>The dispute over how to respond to the civil war in Syria has exposed deep divisions in Europe. Senior European officials say much of the debate is \"hypocritical\" because some of the countries calling for a lifting of the embargo do not have the weapons to deliver or have no intention of taking part. They also point out that the White House and the State Department appear to be similarly split between hawks and doves.</p>","headline":"UK forces EU to lift embargo on Syria rebel arms","trailText":"<p>Uncertainty surrounding European sanctions as Britain claims victory after day of acrimonious negotiations</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2013/5/28/1369701226071/William-Hague-Jean-Asselb-003.jpg","wordcount":"939","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"409603861","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7651724","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Traynor in Brussels","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-05-28T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1913782","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-05-31T00:34:42Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/28/uk-forced-eu-embargo-syria-rebel-arms","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/28/uk-forced-eu-embargo-syria-rebel-arms","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

formally requested the deployment of Nato Patriot missiles on its territory in what it called a defensive measure against the threat of attack from Syria.</p><p>The upgraded Patriot system that Turkey has requested can intercept both incoming missiles and aircraft, but Ankara has insisted that it would not be used to enforce a no-fly zone, but only to act as a defensive measure should Syria launch an attack. However, the move would bring Nato one step closer to involvement in the Syrian conflict.</p><p>The alliance's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_91426.htm?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=smc&amp;utm_campaign=121121+patriots&amp;utm_term=turkey&amp;buffer_share=71b34\" title=\"\">said the alliance would discuss it</a> \"without delay\" and would send an advance team to Turkey next week to explore potential sites for the Patriot system. Rasmussen added that it was up to the countries which have the Patriot launchers and advanced missiles that Ankara is requesting – Germany, the Netherlands and the US – to decide whether they could provide them. The last time Patriot missiles were deployed in Turkey, at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003, the system was provided by Germany and the Netherlands. Both governments have approached their parliaments to ask approval.</p><p>\"Such a deployment would augment Turkey's air defence capabilities to defend the population and territory of Turkey,\" Rasmussen said in his statement confirming receipt of the Turkish letter of request. \"It would contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along Nato's south-eastern border. And it would be a concrete demonstration of Alliance solidarity and resolve.\"</p><p>He noted that: \"In its letter, the Turkish government stressed that the deployment will be defensive only, and that it will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation.\"</p><p>A Nato official noted that Turkey had a formidable air force that could deal with the threat of Syrian warplanes encroaching into Turkish airspace but it did not have a means of intercepting incoming missiles, a capability that has added significance as Syria is believed to have chemical weapons.</p>","headline":"Turkey requests Nato Patriot missiles","trailText":"Nato considers request from Turkey for Patriot missiles to help country protect its border with conflict-torn Syria","newspaperPageNumber":"24","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2012/11/21/1353519070662/Turkey-Syria-border-003.jpg","wordcount":"321","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"399800442","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6932244","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, Diplomatic Editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-22T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1832124","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-24T17:31:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/turkey-nato-patriot-missiles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/21/turkey-nato-patriot-missiles","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/nato","webTitle":"Nato","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nato","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

An estimated 70,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been injured, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2013/mar/06/syria-refugees-one-million-live\" title=\"\">1&nbsp;million are now refugees</a>, and a generation has been lost to violence. However, the worst is yet to come. If the Assad regime does not fall soon, the conflict will spread to the entire region, from Basra on the banks of the Gulf to Beirut on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/14/syria-crisis-france-britain-rebels\" title=\"\">Britain and France have expressed their intention to arm the Syrian resistance</a> and want to lift the European arms embargo. However, many in the Syrian opposition believe this is not sufficient unless it is part of a clear strategy to overthrow the Assad regime.</p><p>The western approach, led by the US, has so far achieved only a stalemate between the rebels and the regime. The regime's recent use of Scud missiles, and the continued supply of arms from Russia and Iran, have tipped the balance between the rebels and the regime in the regime's favour. Seen in this light, the latest move by the British and French is simply an attempt to rebalance the conflict, and is part of a wider western strategy to use stalemate to force both sides to achieve a peaceful settlement. This will not put an end to the violence, nor will it lead to a settlement any time soon. Indeed, the third year of the Syrian revolution will now almost certainly see a shift in the crisis: it is set to become a cross-border conflict posing the greatest challenge to the region's stability since its current borders were drawn after the first world war.</p><p>The crisis may spill over into Lebanon first. It borders Syria, and its internal political players are already involved in the crisis; when Hezbollah supported the Assad regime politically and logistically, other Lebanese parties lent their support to the revolutionaries. After two years of pulling and tugging, this has resulted in heightened levels of tension and polarisation in Lebanon.</p><p>The more lethal development, however, would be for the conflict to reach Iraq. We have started to see indications of this, including political conflict between the Shia regime of Nouri al-Maliki, which is supportive of the Assad regime, the Sunni-dominated provinces, and the Kurdish region of Iraq. Moreover, the protests that have gone on for three months in the Sunni areas have reached a dead end, as Maliki has not responded to their demands. This has led to another round of bloody violence, to which the Syrian crisis will be a natural extension.</p><p>Iraq, which has not yet recovered from the wounds of the civil war that tore it apart after the US invasion, would take the sectarian conflict in the area to unprecedented levels. It would also pull neighbouring countries, such as Iran, Turkey and the Arab Gulf states, into the conflict as the fight over Iraq will be not only for its oil resources, but for the true soul of the Middle East. What happens there would determine the balance of regional power and redraw the political map.</p><p>Can this scenario be avoided? It depends on how the regional and international forces act in the coming months. The US must redirect its priorities to allow the rebels to overthrow the regime. Although direct military intervention is not welcome, the west should not prohibit supplies of weapons to the revolutionaries.</p><p>The US has justified such prohibition in various ways: the fear of post-Assad chaos; the possibility of Islamists rising to power; the fact that Syria is a neighbour of Israel and that weapons could fall into the hands of jihadists. But that hesitation has been disastrous for the US's objectives. Because of its fear of potential terrorism, it failed to bring down the Syrian regime at a time when the revolution was completely removed from the influence of al-Qaida or any other jihadist groups. US hesitation drove the revolution to become what the US feared most: it was a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>The Syrian regime's sense of relative security led to the acceleration of the violence against civilians. In response to this, and in the face of international reluctance to supply arms to the moderate Free Syrian Army, jihadist elements increased. We are now faced with the emergence of groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/11/us-blacklists-syria-al-nusra-front-terrorist\" title=\"\">al-Nusra Front</a>, which the US recently added to the list of terrorist groups. This was a mistake, as it distracted the international community and regional powers from the priority of overthrowing the regime, and directed it instead to fight the jihadists. Meanwhile, the al-Nusra Front benefited from its American classification and has become more powerful.</p><p>The absence of a clear strategy to deal with the Syrian crisis has sent conflicting messages to the region's countries.

At the present time this is the wrong decision. It will only prolong the crisis.\"</p><p>Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia, has supplied money and weapons to the anti-Assad forces but is understood to have been pressured by western governments to ease up because of growing concern that weapons are being funnelled to radical or jihadi groups that are not under the influence of the western-backed Syrian National Coalition. Rebel forces have complained that weapons and ammunition are drying up.</p><p>Public discussion of this issue is rare. Last month Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former spy chief and senior Saudi royal, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/25/arm-syrian-rebels-jihadis-saudi\" title=\"\">said</a> the rebels should be given anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to \"level the playing field\" and ensure that \"extremist\" groups did not dominate the opposition.</p><p>On Tuesday the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/world/middleeast/as-assad-holds-firm-obama-could-revisit-arms-policy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">reported</a> that the US may reconsider its refusal to supply weapons to the rebels. Barack Obama rebuffed the advice of his senior security officials last autumn, but with conditions in Syria continuing to deteriorate the debate could be reopened. \"This is not a closed decision,\" a senior administration official told the paper. \"As the situation evolves, as our confidence increases, we might revisit it.\"</p><p>Obama's decision not to provide arms was driven by his reluctance to get drawn into a proxy war and by his fear that the weapons would end up in unreliable hands, where they could be used against civilians or Israeli and US interests.</p><p>The state department has provided $50m of non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, including satellite telephones, radios, broadcasting equipment, computers, survival equipment and related training. An FM radio network is to connect broadcasting operations in several Syrian cities in the next few days.</p><p>But the decision not to provide weapons has greatly limited the influence the US has with groups that are likely to control much of Syria if Assad is ousted. The new US secretary of state, John Kerry has said he plans to advance ideas on how to change the situation, including more co-operation with Russia, Syria's closest ally on the UN security council.</p><p>In a related development, the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Mualim, is to visit Moscow next week, the Russian foreign ministry announced. But there is still no agreement on a visit by Moaz al-Khatib, leader of the Syrian National Coalition, dashing hopes for an early start to possible talks between the Assad regime and the opposition. Russia appeared to have hoped the two visits would coincide.</p><p>Russia also said on Tuesday that a call by UN investigators for suspected war criminals in Syria to face prosecution at the international criminal court was \"untimely and unconstructive\".</p>","headline":"Qatar criticises EU over Syria arms embargo","trailText":"Key supporter of Syrian rebels says decision to extend blanket arms embargo will only prolong war","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/19/1361295702380/Free-Syrian-Army-fighters-003.jpg","wordcount":"570","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"404341516","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7269016","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Black, Middle East editor","internalPageCode":"1869873","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-02-22T17:54:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/19/qatar-eu-syria-arms-embargo","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/19/qatar-eu-syria-arms-embargo","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

But Austria, Finland, Sweden and the Czech Republic are still opposed. Ambassadors of all 27 EU members have been called into the state department in Washington to be told of the latest US position ahead of a crucial foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels next Monday.</p><p>Speaking in Jordan on Wednesday, Kerry pledged publicly that the US and its EU allies would step up support for Syrian opposition forces to help them \"fight for the freedom of their country\" if Assad does not engage in talks with the rebels in good faith. Efforts are under way, with Russian backing, to convene a peace conference in Geneva some time in June.</p><p>In Britain, however, plans to amend the EU embargo are being complicated by disagreements between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats and a row in Whitehall about the risks of supplying weapons to rebels fighting Assad's regime.</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, who is with Kerry in Amman to discuss Syria, made clear the UK wants to alter the embargo to put pressure on Assad, but without yet deciding to send any weapons. Options include an amendment to allow weapons to be supplied to the opposition Syrian National Coalition or removal of the word \"non-lethal\" from the text. Another possibility is a short rollover of the embargo, which expires on 1 June, to see if the Geneva talks have any prospect of success – or deadlock. If there is no agreement the ban will lapse. That leaves open the possibility of unilateral decisions to supply arms, though in the UK that could clearly trigger a coalition crisis.</p><p>Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, faces strong differences inside his own party. \"There is a fallacy in the government position,\" Menzies Campbell, the senior Lib Dem foreign affairs expert, told the Guardian. \"It is said that the purpose of giving more sophisticated weapons to the rebels is to send a message to Assad but his regime is so heavily supported by the Russians that if there was any imbalance Moscow would be bound to redress it.\"</p><p>Douglas Alexander, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, said that David Cameron had allowed speculation to build about the government's willingness to veto the EU embargo. \"But how would the government prevent British-supplied weapons falling into the wrong hands?\" he asked. \"How does supplying weapons help to secure a lasting peace?\"</p><p>The rebels and their supporters say the embargo must be lifted to help the anti-Assad camp resist overwhemingly superior Syrian government forces, which are equipped with tanks, aircraft and missiles and are supplied by Russia and Iran.</p><p>Labour says that regardless of the status of the embargo, any weapons deliveries would breach other EU and UN agreements that are binding on the UK.</p><p>Whitehall sources say the national security council, which is chaired by the prime minister, has \"grave concerns\" about the risk that weapons could fall into \"the wrong hands\", amid concern about the growing strength and prominence of jihadi-type groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, which is linked to al-Qaida.</p><p>Alistair Burt, the foreign office minister for the Middle East, told MPs on Tuesday night: \"There are no guarantees, but over time we have established a series of links with moderate groups who would have no vested interest in allowing equipment that might be used against them to fall into the wrong hands.\" Hague said on Monday that the UK could supply arms \"only in carefully controlled circumstances, and with very clear commitments from the opposition side\". Some arrangements would \"necessarily be confidential.\"</p><p>Fighters with the Free Syrian Army, the mainstream rebel group, are being vetted in Jordan, where UK special forces and MI6 officers are believed to be involved. The CIA has reportedly been involved in training and coordinating arms deliveries from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar.</p><p>Information about the vetting process is shrouded in secrecy, but Hague said in a written parliamentary answer last week: \"We are in close contact with the leadership of the Syrian National Coalition and Supreme Military Command Council in order to identify training beneficiaries that meet our criteria for the Law of Armed Conflict training. To ensure that the recipients of the training are legitimate members of the opposition all beneficiaries are carefully screened before they are invited to attend the training.\"</p><p>The fragmentation of rebel groups, the lack of a centralised command structure, the kidnapping of UN peacekeepers and human rights abuses are all sources of concern. The recent incident in which a rebel commander in Homs was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/14/syria-mutilation-footage-rebels-eat?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">filmed eating the heart or lung of a dead government soldier</a> caused widespread revulsion.</p><p>The Syrian National Coalition released a video yesterday entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0wRPfz91c4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1\" title=\"\">Fighter not a Killer</a>\" — a YouTube and TV advert about the norms of international humanitarian law and human rights law. \"In light of the recent events that have occurred within the Free Syrian Army, we felt that it is imperative to outline and educate what is acceptable and what is not,\" said a spokesman, Khaled Saleh.</p><p>Oxfam also issued a warning against lifting the embargo: \"Sending arms to the Syrian opposition won't create a level playing field,\" it said in a statement. \"Instead, it risks further fuelling an arms free-for-all where the victims are the civilians of Syria. Our experience from other conflict zones tells us that this crisis will only drag on for far longer if more and more arms are poured into the country.\"An estimated 80,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began in March 2011. Millions have fled their homes inside Syria or become refugees abroad.</p>","headline":"US pushes Europe to amend arms embargo on Syrian rebels","trailText":"John Kerry seeks support for British-led move as means of pressuring Bashar al-Assad to enter into peace negotiations","newspaperPageNumber":"33","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/22/1369258283848/Free-Syrian-Army-fighter-003.jpg","wordcount":"1005","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"409352198","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7631787","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Black, Middle East editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1911801","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-05-25T21:31:46Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/syria-arms-embargo-rebels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/22/syria-arms-embargo-rebels","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Pinned down by air power and shelling that can hit them wherever they are, opposition fighters have barely advanced in Aleppo and Damascus; their gains in some areas have been offset by losses in others.</p><p>With grinding stalemate now the undeniable reality, the rebels have pleaded for weapons that could give them a tactical edge. While they have enough Kalashnikovs and ammunition to keep the battle going, they don't have the firepower they need to win it.</p><p>Top of their wish list has been anti-aircraft weapons, particularly missiles such as the shoulder launched heat seekers that they have managed to steal from regime military bases and used to down an estimated 15 Mig fighters and attack helicopters. No more than a handful of such weapons have been smuggled into Syria – many more have been confiscated by Jordanian and Turkish intelligence officers, much to the chagrin of myriad gunrunners.</p><p>Most, if not all of the seized heat seekers had been sourced from Libyan arms depots looted after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. Under heavy US pressure, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who recently stepped up their direct support for some groups, have been reluctant to give them what they want.</p><p>The Americans' fears, seconded by Israel, are based on a repeat of the Afghanistan scenario of the late 80s, in which surface-to-air missiles supplied by the CIA to combat the Soviet air force fell into the hands of groups who might have other targets in mind, such as civilian aircraft.</p><p>The patchwork of Syria's opposition fighting groups cannot speak with a common voice. The jihadist groups among them – at first an insignificant rabble and now a sizable, potent minority – have very different aims to those groups fighting a nationalistic cause. Keeping such weapons out of their hands is more important to the US in particular than deciding who might be worthy of support.</p><p>To that end, a reluctant US administration has lately settled on Salam Idriss, the commander of the umbrella guerilla group the Free Syria Army, as a leader for whom it is prepared to take a risk. Dealings between Idriss and the US military have stepped up in recent months, both in Jordan and Turkey, where small groups of Syrian rebels are being trained.</p><p>An influx of Saudi-supplied weapons that crossed the Jordanian border earlier this year  were channelled through vetted Idriss loyalists. The supply included explosives that can take out tanks and cause extensive damage to structures as rebels advance. But it did not include the holy grail of heat seekers.</p><p>When John McCain, an outspoken advocate of direct US intervention in Syria's civil war, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/27/john-mccain-rebel-leaders-syria\" title=\"\">crossed the Turkish border into the rebel heartland</a> of northern Syria earlier this week, he repeated his insistence that more had to be done to take the fight to the Assad regime and that the international community had an obligation to act. McCain seems as sure as he can be that an arming effort could be managed to stop powerful weapons falling into the hands of al-Qaida-aligned groups that may have a different purpose in mind for them.</p><p>The veteran senator and former presidential candidate is clearly conscious of the dangers of overreaching. While he endorses the supply of stalemate-breaking weapons to rebel depots, he has so far drawn the line on missiles that can down planes. McCain well knows the damage caused by the last US lawmaker to wander around an insurgency offering heat seekers – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/10/texas-congressman-charlie-wilson-dies\" title=\"\">Charlie Wilson in the early 1980s</a>.

If we don&rsquo;t get more supplies we will be forced to shut down the hospital.</p> <p>We are doing our best to get medical equipment from Turkey and then smuggle it into the city. But the centre of Deir el-Zour is completely surrounded by the Syrian army</p> <p>We have used up stores from deserted pharmacies, private clinics and donations from families.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lilian set up the hospital with four other doctors - his two brothers and two friends. He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We offer medical aid to rebel fighters as well as for more than 8,000 families who are living under siege. They can't get to the government hospital on the edge of the city.</p> <p>Lot of the families have left the city to escape the bombardment. There used to be between up 15 deaths per a day. Now it is nearer five.</p> <p>We have four anaesthesia machines that we recovered from bombed private clinics. I have a good nursing team too. And we were able to set up a room for operations, with a portable X-ray machine. But is impossible to sterilize equipment. And we don&rsquo;t have a have a single ambulance in the city.</p> <p>Our main concern is to save the lives of the wounded, and then it is down to luck.</p> <p>Every day the shelling starts at six in the morning, or before. Then rebel fighters begin to come in. They are either wounded in clashes with the army, or they have artillery injuries. They are usually bought by by pickups. There are at least 15 wounded people every single day. If the shelling targets residential areas, lots of the casualties are children.</p> <p>We can do amputations, take out bullets and shrapnel, and stitch up wounds. But we are helpless if there are head injuries. We don&rsquo;t have the equipment or specialists to deal with them. Patients with head injuries have to be taken to Turkey or they will die.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509ba1d495cb1506d2444b7f\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-08T16:03:46.955Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Assad says world can't afford to intervene in Syria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>President Assad says the world can't afford to intervene in Syria.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://rt.com/news/assad-exclusive-interview-syria-240/\">interview with Russia Today</a>, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not think the west is going [to intervene], but if they do so, nobody can tell what is next.

It has  yet to put a formal request to the alliance, but Turkish officials said the latest bombing showed it was necessary for it to strengthen the defences on its southern flank. Turkey, which has about 120,000 Syrian refugees on its territory, is also pushing for expanding western backing for the rebels.</p><p>The new National Coalition, which claims to represent 90% of Syrian opposition groups, including the various rebel armed forces inside the country, won recognition from Gulf states  night but looked likely to win only observer status at Tuesday's Arab League meeting in Cairo.</p><p>It hopes to be recognised as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people by western nations at a meeting of the Friends of Syria in Marrakech next month.</p><p>\"The international community realises the situation in Syria is unsustainable and that its own self-interest is at stake as it destabilises the region,\" said Yaser Tabbara, a coalition spokesman. \"We have assuaged a lot of the concerns and fulfilled a lot of preconditions on the Syrian armed opposition in terms of accountability and unity, and I believe the international community is ready to invest in the opposition both militarily and politically. That is the sense we got in Doha.\"</p><p>Tabbara said the coalition would be asking for \"the types of weapons with which we can enforce our own no-fly zones\", a reference to portable anti-aircraft missiles which the rebels have long been seeking. Western officials have had deep misgivings about providing such missiles in case they ended up in terrorist hands and used against civilian airliners, but they are increasingly alarmed about the destabilising consequences of non-intervention. Qatar and Saudia Arabia have provided most of the rebels' arms supplies, but those weapons have gone disproportionately to extremist Salafist and jihadist groups, who have been increasingly prominent in Aleppo and other fronts in the civil war.</p><p>Britain and the US are reviewing their policy of restricting their assistance to non-military equipment. Prime minister David Cameron is frustrated with the military impasse and the rising death toll, so the British government has announced it is opening talks with rebel commanders. The French military are believed to be making contingency plans for supplying weapons. Welcoming the formation of the National Coalition, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, made a pointed reference to the prospect of arming the opposition.</p><p>\"France – who recognizes the Syrian people's right to defend themselves against the attacks of the criminal regime in Damascus – very much hopes this coalition can be quickly consolidated, enjoying the broadest possible support from Syrians and the international community,\" Fabius said.</p><p>Western officials have been urging the coalition leadership to act fast to turn the Doha agreement into an functioning alternative administration, to speed international recognition and arms supplies. \"We are not entirely there,\" a European diplomat said.</p><p>Syrian opposition leaders say, in return, they can only establish the necessary structures once they receive more western backing.</p><p>\"We keep hearing about this concept of sequencing,\"</p><p>Tabbara said. \"But we are in a Catch 22. We are told we will get the serious support once we have operational structures in place but we in the middle  know things are more complex. In order to build a government with full authority inside the country, we need support and political recognition. We are trying to balance this Catch 22 as delicately as we can, and try to move in parallel with the demands of the international community.\"</p><p>Syria is likely to figure in the EU summit next month, but so far no member state has put the existing EU arms embargo on the agenda. Revising or lifting it would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states. British lawyers are looking at whether the wording of the embargo agreement, allowing a state to supply weapons if it determines it \"is intended solely for humanitarian or protective use\", provides a loophole.</p><p>Western capitals may hope that the credible threat of heightened intervention could be enough to persuade Russia and China to agree to a UN security council resolution putting sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Russia has thus far been adamantly opposed to a punitive UN action against the regime, a close regional ally.  Russia gave the new coalition a cool reception, urging it to negotiate with Assad and to reject \"outside interference\".</p>","headline":"Syrian opposition says west has promised military aid","trailText":"<p>New National Coalition claims its 'accountability and unity' has assuaged concerns about arming rebels</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352752107828/Syrian-government-aircraf-003.jpg","wordcount":"857","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"399274014","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6895445","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, diplomatic editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1827922","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-15T20:33:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/12/syria-opposition-coalition-military-aid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/12/syria-opposition-coalition-military-aid","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

No one can claim to represent most or all Syrians now; neither the regime nor the opposition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turkmani added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real unity which matters right now is not that of the political opposition, but that of the international community. Once an international consensus is agreed it is going to be much easier to unite the opposition, and more importantly, end the regime. Russia and China are going to view this group as hostile to them. They are key players in this conflict, and you simply can't solve a conflict if you do not involve all the players.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turkmani said the opposition leader Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib was a &ldquo;great man&rdquo; whom she has known as a friend for 20 years, but she said he was in the wrong post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I trust him to be an honest leader with the best interests of Syria and the Syrians at his heart. But I am not sure he is in the right place.

He comes at a time when this is needed more than ever. Syria is in ruins. The man is someone who all parties, whatever their ideological background, ethnicities or feelings about the former regime, will be able get behind. He is a man of real moral qualities.</p> <p>He understands that the extraordinary quality of Syria is that it is a country with many religions, many languages [and] many ethnicities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked how a former Sunni cleric can unite Syria&rsquo;s disparate sects, Kabbani said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is not a conventional imam in any sense of the word. He is representative of a mosque [The Umayyad in Damascus] and a city which were themselves very layered. The Umayyad mosque had been a pagan temple, and then a Greek one, then a Roman one, then a Christian church, and then became a mosque. So this is a place where all Syria worships and thinks of as its centre.</p> </blockquote> <p>Khatib has history in grassroots activism if not national politics, Kabbani said. He and his friends and family have been arrested many times.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He comes from the post-Hama generation [a reference to the massacre of Muslim Brotherhood opposition in 1982]. Those men and women who knew exactly what the Assads were like and knew what was required to change Syria.</p> <p>I for once, in many many months, suddenly feel optimistic about the future ... because he&rsquo;s a unifying figure and not a divisive one. He is not what he seems. He is not a traditional Islamist. He is not the traditional Sunni. He is someone who has all of Syria at heart.</p> <p>He has a long history of good works and he was able to function in a country that would have liked to see him killed many years ago. That is an indication of his supple nature and his real courage and vigilance.</p> <p>He has a hell of a job ahead of him. And I wish him great luck, but I don&rsquo;t think it is an impossible job.</p> </blockquote> <p>She claimed those in the Syrian National Council who refused to get behind Khatib will &ldquo;go down with Assad&rdquo;.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1054377-syria-s-new-opposition-leader-is-a-unifying-figure-and-not-a-traditional-imam-says-ranakabbani54/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1054377-syria-s-new-opposition-leader-is-a-unifying-figure-and-not-a-traditional-imam-says-ranakabbani54&quot;&gt;listen to ‘Syria's new opposition leader is a unifying figure and not a traditional imam says @RanaKabbani54’ on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50a0e3c0b57908e185b9d6e8\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-12T16:19:16.694Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Biography of new opposition leader</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, the 52-year-old former cleric elected leader of the Syrian opposition, emerges as something of a renaissance man, according to his CV.</p> <p>He has had stints as an imam, activist, lecturer and he is a trained geologist who worked for an oil company.</p> <p>A biography of the new leader, circulated by opposition member Mulham al-Jundi, said Khatib was arrested four times for supporting the Syrian uprising before leaving the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>He was mostly recently arrested in April, it says.</p> <p>In his opening speech as leader Khatib called on all sects in Syria to unite. \"We demand freedom for every Sunni, Alawi, Ismaili (Shia), Christian, Druze, Assyrian ... and rights for all parts of the harmonious Syrian people,\" he said.</p> <p>Khatib, who comes from a family of Islamic scholars, has a reputation for rejecting&nbsp;sectarianism, according to the biography.

Ultimately our goal is to get support to the Syrian people on the ground. That&rsquo;s what matters.\"</p> <p>Asked whether the international community had promised to arm the rebels if the opposition united, Saleh said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were promises of full support. That includes I think diplomatic, political, financial, even possibly arming the revolutionary forces on the ground. At this point we are looking to the next couple of weeks to see. We have done our part &hellip; Now we are looking to the international community to fulfil their promises &hellip;</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t think the international community can give the excuse the opposition is not united.</p> </blockquote> <p>Saleh&nbsp;claimed 90% of the Syrian opposition were represented on the new coalition.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a major turning point &hellip; Bringing that many opposition groups together was a major step. It is difficult to look at the new coalition body and say the opposition is still not united &hellip;</p> <p>The international community had a problem that they were trying to solve. They were trying to figure out a way to have a unified mechanism to get support to Syria. The SNC was an umbrella organisation yet there were some opposition parties that were outside of it.</p> <p>The international community put some pressure on us to really try and take a leadership role in bringing more of the opposition parties into this coalition. After two or three days of negotiations we came to terms and everybody I think is happy with the result.</p> </blockquote> <p>Saleh said the the new coalition includes representatives from the joint military council that controls about 80% of the rebel forces in Syria. It will also try to rein in the remaining 20% it does not control.</p> <p>On the prospects for a shadow or provisional government, Saleh said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point we are looking to the international community to officially recognise the coalition as the one legitimate representative of the Syrian people. When that happens we will start working right away on a transitional provisional government.</p> </blockquote> <p>He claimed the new leader, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, had the leadership calibre to hold the group together and that he would benefit from the experience of figures from the Syrian National Council.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1054203-onus-now-international-community-to-support-and-arm-syrian-opposition-says-member-of-new-coalition/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1054203-onus-now-international-community-to-support-and-arm-syrian-opposition-says-member-of-new-coalition&quot;&gt;listen to ‘Onus now international community to support and arm Syrian opposition says member of new coalition’ on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50a0bc0d95cbc35cbe75e01a\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-12T16:19:16.694Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Britain to host talks on further support for opposition</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain is to host talks on Friday to consider new ways of supporting the Syrian opposition after David Cameron suggested the international community should help arm the rebels.</p> <p>In a statement foreign secretary <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=833766782\">William Hague welcomed the formation of the new opposition coalition in Doha</a>.</p> <p>He also announced international meetings on Tuesday and Friday to support the new group.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will travel to Cairo for a meeting of the EU and Arab League this Tuesday, which will discuss support to the new national coalition.

called for other states to endorse an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/12/syria-opposition-unity-coaltion-video\">umbrella deal signed on Sunday</a> night that unites feuding anti-Assad groups and paves a way for funding to resume.</p><p>The formation of the group had been a key demand of the US and the Gulf states, which have sidelined the original political body, the Syrian National Council, and urged that a broader and more representative group be established.</p><p>After a week of wrangling in the Qatari capital, Doha, the chance of such a group being enshrined had nearly evaporated. However, an agreement was finally reached that absorbed the SNC and nominated a new leadership.</p><p>A former imam at the Umayyad mosque in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, was named leader. Riad Seif, who proposed the new initiative, and Suhair Atassi, a female activist, will be his deputies.</p><p>Qatar, which had invested much regional capital in an accord being struck on its soil, said the international community no longer had an excuse to ignore the Syrian opposition. Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, adopted a similar tone. Qatar later called for the new body to be considered the only legitimate representative of the Syrian people.</p><p>\"Trust us that we will strive from now on to have this new body recognised completely by all parties … as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people,\" said Qatar's prime minister, Hamid bin Jassem.</p><p>The SNC, which has been lambasted as nepotistic exiles detached from realities inside Syria, will no longer be the dominant voice in the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. The new group – the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces – will attempt to represent political, military and civil groups under a united banner.</p><p>The SNC remained reluctant to the end to lend its weight to the agreement, but faced a prosect of being sidelined altogether. It had already lost the confidence of the US and Arab League members as the Syrian civil war steadily worsened.</p><p>The new group is understood to be waiting for the recognition of the broader international community before announcing a provisional government.</p><p>Military leaders inside Syria and civilian leaders in exile are still unlikely to gain support for their call for the establishment of a no-fly zone over parts, or all, of Syria. The US has been reluctant to support such a move and Robert Ford, a senior administration official and former ambassador to Damascus, said Barack Obama was unlikely to drop his opposition during his second term as president.</p><p>Russia and China, which have blocked previous moves against the Assad regime at the United Nations security council, appear unlikely to change their stances.</p><p>Observers in Doha cautioned that the hard won agreement could still encounter trouble. Some Arab officials familiar with fraught opposition diplomacy say the SNC started with wide consensus and promise but later proved it could not deliver.</p>","headline":"Syrian rebels show united front","trailText":"<p>Feuding factions finally put aside differences to agree deal combining Syrian National Council with smaller groups</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"24","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352678629533/syria-opposition-groups-u-003.jpg","wordcount":"476","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"399213660","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6892198","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Chulov","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1827467","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-15T00:04:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/12/syria-rebels-unite","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/12/syria-rebels-unite","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

in the Golan Heights, amid fears that Israel could become sucked into the conflict across the border.</p><p>The Israeli military confirmed that tank shells fired by its troops in response to the mortar had made a direct hit. According to military sources, a Syrian mobile artillery battery was the target.</p><p>An Israeli government official hinted that the Damascus regime could be deliberately targeting the Golan. \"Up until yesterday, our assessment was that ordnance that had fallen in Israel was a spillover from the internal conflict inside Syria. Our assessment has changed in the past 24 hours,\" the official told the Guardian.</p><p>On Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces fired across the ceasefire line between Syria and the Golan Heights – which Israel has occupied since 1967 – for the first time since the Yom Kippur war almost 40 years ago.</p><p>Israel has filed complaints with the United Nations, whose forces patrol the demilitarised zone between Syria and the Golan, and warned that cross-border fire \"will be responded to with severity\".</p><p>Mortars from Syria have landed in the Golan five times in the past week. There has also been some cross-border gunfire, and three Syrian army tanks briefly entered the demilitarised zone last weekend.</p><p>Some Israeli observers fear that Syria's beleaguered president, Bashar al-Assad, may seek a confrontation with Israel as a way of rallying support for the regime after more than 18 months of civil war.</p><p>Israel's military chief, Benny Gantz, warned a week ago that the \"Syrian issue … could become our issue.\"</p><p>On Sunday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called for restraint from both Israel and Syria. \"The secretary general is deeply concerned by the potential for escalation. He calls for the utmost restraint and urges Syria and Israel to uphold the disengagement agreement, respect their mutual obligations, and halt firing of any kind across the ceasefire line,\" said a statement issued by his office.</p><p>Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 six-day war, and later annexed it. Although the two countries are still technically at war, the area has been relatively quiet. However, the Syrian government has demanded the return of the Golan as part of any peace agreement with Israel. About 20,000 Druze villagers living in the Golan identify strongly with Syria and there are close family links across the buffer zone.</p><p>The Israeli government has been reluctant to comment publicly on the civil war in Syria but it is deeply concerned about instability in the region. It says Islamic jihadists are increasingly operating in Syria, the Egyptian Sinai and Gaza.</p><p>Meanwhile, rockets continued to be fired from Gaza into southern Israel despite Egyptian efforts to broker a ceasefire after a weekend of escalating violence.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told a gathering of 50 ambassadors in Ashkelon, a city close to the Hamas-governed territory, that Israel had \"the right and obligation to defend its citizens\".</p><p>Amid speculation that Israel may be preparing a ground operation inside Gaza to halt rocket fire, Netanyahu said: \"We will not sit idly in front of recurrent attacks that occur almost daily, against our citizens and our children … None of your governments would accept such a situation. We do not accept such a situation, and I as prime minister of Israel am not prepared to accept this situation, and we will act to stop it.\"</p><p>More than 20 people were treated for shock after a rocket hit a house in Netivot on Monday morning. Six Palestinians, including four civilians, were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza over the weekend.</p>","headline":"Israel fires into Syria for second day","trailText":"IDF says it made direct hit, believed to be on Syrian mobile artillery, in response to shell landing near post in Golan Heights","newspaperPageNumber":"20","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/12/1352740446654/Smoke-in-Israeli-Syrian-b-005.jpg","wordcount":"604","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"399259627","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6894268","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1827825","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-15T17:17:46Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/12/israel-fires-syria-second-day","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/12/israel-fires-syria-second-day","tags":[{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/israel","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

The pace of the moves and what they potentially represent has left many in government, and indeed in Europe, stunned. For the first time in almost 20 months a real clamour has started about a potential intervention in a conflict that had been too delicate and dangerous for any country to confront.</p><p>The new British posture on Syria was announced by David Cameron an hour after Barack Obama claimed victory in the US election. It has strengthened ever since, every step personally backed by the prime minister, who government officials say has become fed up with the endless slaughter and intransigence and is now willing to do something about it.</p><p>Britain's new stance on Syria is well ahead of its allies in Europe, or across the Atlantic, with the exception of France. It is also increasingly at odds with Damascus's key European backer, Russia, which shows no sign of watering down its resolute support for its Soviet-era ally.</p><p>Both Downing Street and Whitehall know the risks of being well out in front on Syria. Attempts to build meaningful diplomatic alliances have so far led to nothing more than condemnations and sanctions.</p><p>While seething at the death toll in Syria's Sunni-led insurrection and sending funds to fighting groups, the Gulf states – all led by Sunni regimes – have insisted that the US, or another western power, take public charge of dealing with Assad. None had been willing, especially without UN security council backing.</p><p>Last week, a key US official, the former ambassador to Damascus Robert Ford, now a senior player in the White House national security council, said a re-elected Obama was unlikely to change his opposition to a US role. A no-fly zone, a key hope of Syrian rebel groups, would continue to remain off the table.</p><p>If Assad's friends and foes agree on one thing, it is the grave risk of miscalculating in Syria – a state created along several of the region's main geopolitical fault lines and secured by alliances with key western protagonists. But something in Cameron's risk calculus appears to have changed. His advisers suggest he lost patience with daily reports of death and depravity and with an international response that has offered few solutions.</p><p>European officials, meanwhile, do not know what to make of Britain's stance. While broadly supporting the Syrian opposition, key European powers remain stymied by Russia and China and deeply wary of the combustible Middle East igniting if or when Assad falls.</p><p>With so much at stake and with enmity between both sides so entrenched, a seamless transition of power seems next to impossible. Missteps could lead the Levant towards a Balkanisation along ethnic sectarian lines – a nightmare scenario with widespread ramifications elsewhere in the region.</p><p>Nevertheless, an opposition momentum, so elusive since the now stalled armed push into Aleppo and Damascus in July, has clearly energised a reluctant west. The ink on the hard-fought deal to form what is in effect an alternative government in waiting had barely dried before Britain, Turkey and Qatar, among others, were rushing to endorse it.</p><p>The arrival of Sunni Arab donors in London later this week will mark potentially the most decisive phase yet in the campaign against Assad. With a new, more representative body now in place, Britain no longer seems shy about what the cash that the conference will surely attract will end up being used for.</p><p></p><p>Weapons no longer seems to be a dirty word in government circles. Rebels who had complained that binoculars and satellite phones, which Britain promised over the summer, were not helping them win seem to sense that their time may have arrived.</p><p>Just what the British support will end up entailing is still being thrashed out, primarily in Downing Street and Whitehall. British officials in the region had complained over the summer that the government response to the Syrian crisis was around three months out of synch with events on the ground.</p><p>That lost ground is now rapidly being reclaimed. Whether Cameron has the will to directly involve Britain in the conflict is something he seems yet to decide. While he does, Damascus, for the first time in many months, has reason to calibrate its actions. \"It was obvious that he was acting without fear or restraint in recent months,\" one Western official said of Assad in Beirut last week. \"That position is not sustainable.\"</p>","headline":"David Cameron starts to force the pace on Syria conflict","trailText":"The PM's risk calculus appears to have changed - and European officials do not know what to make of his new stance","newspaperPageNumber":"21","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352753476050/David-Cameron-looks-into--003.jpg","wordcount":"754","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"399275075","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6895499","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Chulov","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1827927","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-15T20:52:18Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/12/cameron-syria-conflict-rebels-policy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/12/cameron-syria-conflict-rebels-policy","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

He is also a member of the Syrian Geological Society and the Syrian Society for Psychological Science, and was president of the Islamic Society of Urbanisation. His status as the former imam makes him a key figure in Syria's religious establishment.</p><p>The Syrian journalist and writer Rana Kabbani, who first met Khatib 20 years ago, says: \"Over the years, we have had a very intense political conversation about what needed to be done in Syria, long discussions about what was wrong with the society and what could be done about it. He was my window into Syria at a time when I couldn't physically go there.\"</p><p>Kabbani added: \"He comes from an area in the old city of Damascus, a part of the city that was noted for its advocacy against French colonialists, producing freedom fighters. It was a traditional Damascene Muslim scene, a devout Sunni area with a long history of resistance.</p><p>\"He cared very deeply about the victims of the 1982 massacre [in the Syrian city of Hama]. He was always seeking for ways to house or educate those [survivors] that the state wanted killed or banished.\"</p><p>But it is Khatib's reputation as a moderate that is his most important attribute, at a time when extreme Islamist groups funded by outside powers are trying to hijack Syria's revolution. Since the uprising began, 20 months ago, Assad has played the sectarian card: telling his own Shia Alawite sect that their fortunes are inextricably bound up with the regime's survival. Without him, Assad has suggested, Alawites face the prospect of being massacred; many, though not all, Alawites believe the president.</p><p>In a speech in September, Khatib set out his own inclusive vision of a tolerant Syria in which the country's various confessions and ethnicities  – Christian, Alawite and Kurd among them – would be respected.</p><p>The Christians had added a \"distinctly civilised touch\", he said, while Syrians also \"felt the pains of the great Kurdish people\". He reportedly added: \"It is paramount to appreciate the characteristics of the Syrian people: Syrians are tolerant, devout and open to everyone. By nature, they reject extremism and injustice.\"</p><p>According to Khatib, the uprising against Assad began last year when the \"arrogant\" regime used brutal force to suppress anti-government demonstrators calling for peaceful change. This is  the dominant view among opposition Syrians. \"Syrians were compelled to take up arms in order to defend their religion, families and properties,\" he said. \"The Syrian revolution is not a violent one. Syrian revolutionaries are peaceful.\"</p><p>Khatib was also outspoken about the \"media smearing\" of the Syrian rebel movement, both by the Syrian government and by some in the west. It was inaccurate to portray the opposition as a \"hotbed of Islamic extremism, terrorism and fundamentalism\", he argued.</p><p>Khatib also said he was not averse to negotiating with Assad. He added that political dialogue didn't mean \"surrendering to the regime's cruelty\" but was the pragmatic \"lesser of two evils\".</p><p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, a senior policy fellow on the Middle East at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Khatib now had a difficult job ahead of him. \"His biggest challenge is to unify the different Syrian groups under his leadership. The divisions haven't gone away. They've been swept under the carpet,\" he said, adding: \"Khatib has come out quite recently. That gives him credibility. He also isn't seen as someone who has political ambitions of his own; he is keen to serve Syria.\"</p><p>According to Barnes-Dacey, Khatib's two new vice-presidents were also well-regarded figures: Riad Seif, a longtime activist, led the successful US-backed initiative to start a new Syrian opposition coalition; Suhair Atassi is a prominent female activist who established an important opposition debating salon after Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father, amid hopes he might turn into a reformist.</p><p>Khatib makes his official debut as Syria's opposition leader at an Arab League-EU conference in Cairo this week. The conference is expected to consider offering the new organisation the vacant membership position left when Syria was suspended as a member state. The effect of that would be to recognise Khatib and the new body as a legitimate representative of all Syrians.</p><p>• This article was amended on 14 November 2012.

Four Palestinian civilians were reported killed in air strikes on Gaza.</p><p>In the north, the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) response came amid concerns that the civil war in Syria could spill across the boundary into the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since 1967. In the past week, four shells fired from within Syria have landed in the Golan, although none have caused damage or injuries. Eight days ago, three Syrian tanks briefly entered the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan Heights.</p><p>Sunday's warning shots were the first time the IDF has fired into Syrian territory since the 1973 Yom Kippur war. \"A mortar shell targeted an IDF post in the Golan Heights,\" said the army spokeswoman, Avital Leibovich. \"We answered with a warning shot towards Syrian areas. We understand this was a mistake and was not meant to target Israel and then that is why we fired a warning shot in retaliation.\"</p><p>The Israeli military lodged a complaint through United Nations forces operating in the area, stating that \"fire emanating from Syria into Israel will not be tolerated and shall be responded to with severity\".</p><p>The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday that Israel was \"closely monitoring what is happening on our border with Syria and we are ready for any development\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399302304'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/11/1352654931535/Israel-borders-WEB-001.png' alt='Israel borders WEB' width='460' height='352' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Another army spokesman, Yoav Mordechai, said Israeli forces had targeted a mortar squad operating near the Syrian army position that had apparently fired the mortar into the Golan, and that the IDF estimated there were no casualties on the Syrian side. \"We have no interest in getting in between the rebels and the Syrian army, but to defend the Golan Heights from stray fire,\" he told the Times of Israel.</p><p>In the south, dozens of rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza between Saturday evening and midday on Sunday by militants from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other organisations. Six Palestinians, including four civilians, were reported killed in at least nine separate Israeli air strikes.</p><p>Netanyahu warned that the military was ready to intensify its response to rocket fire from Gaza following the escalation of attacks and counter-attacks.</p><p>The round of violence followed a similar spike almost three weeks ago, which subsided after intervention by Egyptian mediators. But some observers believe Netanyahu may be more inclined to order a robust approach in the runup to Israel's general election on 22 January.</p><p>Militants in Gaza were \"sustaining harsh hits\" from the IDF, Netanyahu told ministers at Sunday's cabinet meeting. \"The world needs to understand that Israel will not sit with its hands tied in the face of attempts to harm us. We are prepared to intensify our response.\"</p><p>Operation Cast Lead, the three-week assault on Gaza in which about 1,400 Palestinians were killed, was launched in the build-up to Israel's last election in 2009.</p><p>Moshe Ya'alon, minister of strategic affairs, reinforced Netanyahu's warning. \"We aren't going to let this stand … We have many means for exacting a price from the other side, and we will deploy them as we see fit, so that in the end we can bring quiet back to the south,\" he told army radio.</p><p>Asked about the possibility of a ground operation, Ya'alon said: \"Everything is being weighed and will be weighed.\" However, he indicated such a move would only be authorised if targeted air strikes failed to stop rocket fire.</p><p>The increase in violence followed the death on Thursday of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy during an incursion by tanks near the city of Khan Yunis. Hamid Younis Abu Daqqa had been playing football with friends when shots were fired from an Israeli helicopter, according to his father.</p><p>Later, an Israeli soldier was slightly injured when a booby-trapped tunnel dug by militants from Gaza towards Israel exploded.</p><p>On Saturday, militants fired an anti-tank missile from Gaza which wounded four Israeli soldiers on a jeep patrol along the border.</p><p>Six Palestinian factions, including Hamas, the ruling party in Gaza, issued a joint statement saying they were responsible for the rocket fire. Since Operation Cast Lead, Hamas has largely tried to restrain other militant groups from launching rockets and mortars, but it has increasingly participated in military operations over the past few weeks.</p><p>The organisation is under pressure from more radical groups within Gaza, which may explain its unusually open participation in recent violence.</p><p>Israel is concerned that large quantities of weapons from Libya are being smuggled into Gaza from Egypt. Last month an anti-aircraft missile was fired from Gaza for the first time at an Israeli military helicopter, according to Israeli defence officials. The shoulder-fired Strela missile missed its target.</p>","headline":"Israel fires warning shots into Syria as violence escalates in Gaza","trailText":"<p>Four Palestinian civilians are reported killed in Gaza as fears grow that Syrian civil war could spill across border</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/11/1352644265218/Israeli-army-tanks-004.jpg","wordcount":"791","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"399194867","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6890556","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1827310","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-14T14:33:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/11/israeli-troops-syria-violence-gaza","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/11/israeli-troops-syria-violence-gaza","tags":[{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/israel","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.
