Keep an eye on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">the website</a>, Twitter, or your nearest Reuters/Bloomberg terminal in case Moody's does downgrade some Spanish banks, as we had expected. In the meantime, here's a closing summary:</p><p><strong>Fears that Greece might leave the eurozone, sparking global turmoil, intensified tonight as Fitch downgraded its credit rating.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-36\">The ratings agency said</a> that there was a heightened risk that next month's election will lead to a government that does not support the current austerity plan, leading to a break-up of the single currency and a Greek default. Fitch would also put all eurozone countries on negative watch, which could lead to further downgrades.</p><p><strong>Rumours of a bank run at Spain's fourth-largest bank rocked the markets.</strong> Spanish media reported that over €1bn had been withdrawn from Bankia since it was nationalised. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-24\">The report was denied</a>, after shares in the bank fell by almost 30%.</p><p><strong>It was another day of losses on many world stock markets.<br /></strong> The FTSE 100 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-31\">closed 66 points lower at 5338</a>, meaning it is now officially in correction territory. On Wall Street, the Dow closed 156 points lower.</p><p><strong>In Greece, the temporary government was swown in as the election campaign got underway.</strong> Polling data painted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-38\">a mixed picture</a>, with one showing New Democracy in the lead, and another placing Syriza in front. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-10\">The party's two leaders both hit the headlines</a>, with ND's Antonis Samaras warning that Greece faced a 'nightmare' if it left the euro, and Syriza's Alexis Tsipras predicting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/17/austerity-will-send-greece-to-hell-alexis-tsipras\">'hell' if it didn't renegotiate its financial programme</a>.</p><p><strong>UK politicians weighed in on the crisis again</strong>. David Cameron urged other leaders on a conference call <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-40\">to take decisive steps to save the eurozone</a>, Alistair Darling warned that the crisis could <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-32\">blow up in a few hours</a>, and Vince Cable argued that Germany would act to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/17/eurozone-crisis-cameron-greece-euro-exit#block-16\">protect the euro</a>.</p><p><em>Thanks, and goodnight!

The fiscal deficit has been reduced markedly and competitiveness has gradually improved. However, the challenges confronting Greece remain significant, with a large competitiveness gap, a high level of public debt, and an undercapitalized banking system.</p><p>\"The new Fund-supported program will enable Greece to address these challenges while remaining in the Eurozone. The program focuses on restoring competitiveness and growth, fiscal sustainability, and financial stability. The authorities are fully committed to these ambitious objectives and stand ready to take any additional measures as may be necessary. The successful debt exchange operation, debt relief and long-term support from Greece's European partners, and the commitment of the major Greek political parties to program objectives and policies provide important assurances for the new program.</p><p>\"Greece's priority is to undertake competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms. The government's bold labor market measures will play a crucial role in this regard, complemented by measures to liberalize professions and product markets, improve the business environment, and privatize state-owned assets.</p><p>\"Significant further fiscal adjustment is necessary to put debt on a sustainable downward trajectory. Reaching a primary surplus of 4½ percent of GDP by 2014 will require politically difficult cuts in government spending, as well as decisive measures to address tax evasion. It is important that the adjustment be both fair and sustainable, through strengthening the core social safety net and tax collection efforts.</p><p>\"Securing financial sector stability and depositor confidence is also a priority. The program secures liquidity support for Greek banks, and provides funds for their recapitalization, alongside incentives to preserve private ownership. The resolution framework and the governance of oversight agencies have been strengthened to ensure appropriate use of public funds and safeguard against conflicts of interest.</p><p>\"Risks to the program remain exceptionally high, and there is no room for slippages. Full and timely implementation of the planned adjustment—alongside broad-based public support and support from Greece's European partners—will be critical to success. The euro area leaders have reiterated their commitment to provide adequate support to Greece during the life of the program and beyond until it has regained market access, provided that Greece fully complies with the requirements and objectives of the adjustment program.\"</p></blockquote><!-- Block 34 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408749'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/recap2.gif' alt='Live blog: recap' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">6.03pm:</span> Time to knock this blog on the head for the day (unless there are any exciting developments this evening, in which case it might roar back into life).</p><p><strong>Here's a closing summary:</strong></p><p>• <strong>The International Monetary Fund has agreed to extend Greece a €28bn loan over the next four years.</strong> The IMF will <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-26\">give Athens €1.65bn straight away</a>.<br />• <strong>The EU taskforce said Greece was making progress to reform its economy.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-25\">Horst Reichenbach. head of the taskforce, admitted there was a huge amount still to do</a> but listed several areas of progress.<br />• <strong>Evangelos Venizelos, the outgoing Greek finance minister, indicated Greece will return to growth in 2013.</strong> The next leader of the Pasok party insisted that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-19\">structural reforms will bring the country to a better future</a>.<br />• <strong>Standard &amp; Poor's said it would raise Greece out of selective default in April.</strong> The new rating, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-28\">of CCC</a>, is lower than that of Fitch.<br />• <strong>Fitch's decision to cut the UK's credit rating outlook to negative hung over the City today.</strong> Economists believe the move means there is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-3\">no chance of George Osborne announcing any unfunded giveaways in next week's Budget</a>.<br />• <strong>It was a mixed day for Ireland.</strong> An oil company <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-11\">struck black gold</a> off the coast of Cork, but the country's central banker called for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating?commentpage=4#block-17\">a more 'proactive' approch to repossessions</a>.

The rating also reflects our view of the sizable implementation risks to the ambitious fiscal consolidation targets under the second financial assistance program for Greece. Our rating on Greece is supported by the increased average maturity of the central government debt stock and the reduction in debt servicing costs as a result of the exchange; and by the recapitalization of the banks, which we believe should help to maintain domestic depositor confidence.</p><p>These factors have, in our view, reduced the risk of a second debt restructuring in the immediate future. Our recovery rating of '4' for Greece remains unchanged, indicating an estimated 30%-50% recovery by bondholders.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 27 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408752'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/12/1305203064788/Live-blog-news-flash-001.jpg' alt='Live blog: news flash newsflash' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.27pm:</span> More breaking news -- <strong>Standard &amp; Poor's has just reiterated its negative outlook on the US credit rating.</strong></p><p>S&amp;P, which famously cut America from AAA to AA+ last August, added that it was improbable any economic improvement would bring back America's triple-A rating anytime soon.</p><p>US shares have responded by, er, heading higher – with the S&amp;P 500 index crashing through the 1,400 mark for the first time since June 2008.</p><!-- Block 26 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408753'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/12/1305203064788/Live-blog-news-flash-001.jpg' alt='Live blog: news flash newsflash' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.02pm:</span> Breaking news from the International Monetary Fund – <strong>it has approved the €28bn loan to Greece</strong>.</p><p>Here's the official statement, confirming that the IMF will pay its share of Greece' second aid package.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a four-year SDR [special drawing rights] 23.8 billion (about €28 billion, or US$36.7 billion) arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Greece in support of the authorities' economic adjustment program.</p><p>The approval allows for an immediate disbursement of SDR 1.4 bilion (about €1.65 billion, or US$2.2 billion).

In fact it is easy to imagine him in an Audi showroom singing the praises of the company's latest model \"it's good, it's dependable, the best of German.\"</p><p>But while keen to always appear exceptionally polite, the soft-spoken German is not into sales pitches or any kind of patter at all. When he speaks he weighs his words carefully. And when he opens his mouth in Greece what comes out is exceptionally measured.<br /> <br />Such attributes were on FULL display this afternoon as the European Commission mandarin spoke at length about the priorities of the task force in Greece – a country with a \"very specific and particular situation.\"<br />A former vice president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Reichenbach who has worked at the European commission for 30 years, has almost overnight become one of the most powerful men in Greece. With growth now the name of the game if the nation is to survive its worst crisis in modern times, Greeks have found themselves, increasingly, hanging from his every word.</p></blockquote><p>But seated before a Greek and EU flag in the grand surroundings of Athens' Zappeion conference centre today Reichenbach was at pains to deny he was taking over the country. The task force was there, he said,  because the Greeks had asked for help.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408754'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/3/15/1331828297034/Horst-Reichenbach-speaks--007.jpg' alt='Horst Reichenbach, speaks during a press conference in Athens on March 15, 2012.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Horst Reichenbach today. Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Here's how <strong>Reichenbach</strong> described the taskforce:</p><p>\"It is a concrete contribution of EU solidarity to Greece. It was created at the request of the former prime minister George Papandreou to assist Greece in absorbing available EU funding … the starting point is always Greek ownership. The Greeks have to present ideas for technical assistance to achieve objectives.\"  </p><p><strong>Helena</strong> continues:</p><blockquote><p>Because Greece \"found it easier\" to enact legislation but was not so good at implementing it, he and his staff had, however, devised a \"road map.\" The taskforce would also be sending in experts (mostly French and German) to overhaul the country's public administration now seen as the biggest barrier to the reforms required to revive the Greek economy and make it more competitive. For the first time civil servants would be evaluated \"as is common practice in other EU states.\"<br />\"A lot remains to be done. There is too much red tape and administrative barriers … for example customs controls for exports take 20 days when the European average is 10 days.\" <br />But, he added, referring to last week's historic restructuring of Greek debt, \"the PSI and second adjustment program have eliminated some of the uncertainty hanging over Greek developments. Now we have the possibility to have a new start on a much more solid basis.\"<br />Another priority was to boost market liquidity by financing small and medium sized enterprises (SME's) – traditionally the Greek economy's lifeblood -- which the German acknowledged had been \"in extremely short supply.\"<br />A total of €4bn was available in the form of grants and loans.  \"We now have to see how this potential can be used,\" he insisted.   <br />\"The second great task of the task force is the technical assistance [it can provide] in favour of structural reforms. An unprecedented amount of assistance has been made available from 16 member states,\" he continued, pointing out EU countries that economically may not be so strong themselves had graciously accepted \"to contribute.\"         <br />There were other areas where Greece could also improve, starting with the modernization of the health system, e-governance and re-organisation of the judicial system also seen as a major obstacle to business in Greece. It was urgent, too, that the Greek banking sector was recapitalized in order to ensure that funds could be disbursed to their \"final destination in the real economy that is SME's.\"<br />In fact there was almost no area of life that would not be affected by the special EU task force.</p></blockquote><p>So was Herr Reichenbach afraid that he or any of his staff might be open to \"abuse or insult\" in Greece, one reporter asked. After all the recent fuss over Berlin's alleged plan to appoint a permanent EU commissioner in Athens it was not unreasonable to think that trouble could lie ahead.</p><p>Helena, though, reports that he merely smiled before launching into Euro-speak about \"mandates and technical assistance\", and smiling again.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.27pm:</span> The euro has climbed higher today, up around half a cent to $1.3078 against the US dollar.</p><p>That's despite <strong>Lorenzo Bini Smagh</strong>, a former member of the European Central Bank, predicting this morning that Portugal and Ireland will both need fresh financial support.</p><p>Bini Smagh argued (as many have before) that Portugal may not be able to return to the financial markets today, and would need a second aid package worth €100bn. Ireland, he added, would need another €80bn.</p><p><strong>David Song</strong>, currency analyst at <strong>DailyFX</strong>, warned that fears over Ireland and Portugal would push the euro lower in the weeks ahead:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We are likely to see the single currency face additional headwinds over the near-term as the sovereign debt crisis continues to drag on investor confidence....</p><p>The heightening risk for contagion instills a bearish forecast for the Euro versus the US dollar as the fundamental outlook for the euro-area remains weak.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 23 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408755'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2011/12/15/1323937941786/Michael-Noonan-004.jpg' alt='Michael Noonan' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister. Photograph: Haydn West/PA</figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.06pm:</span> Ireland's finance minister <strong>Michael Noonan</strong> has touched on an important issue that I've rather neglected above the line -- ongoing negotiations over Irish promissory notes.</p><p>Around €30bn of these promissory notes (a kind of IOU with regular interest payments attached) were issued by the Irish government in 2008 to finance the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank (one of the lenders crushed by the financial crisis). With interest included, the cost of the notes will reach €47bn by the time Ireland has paid them off in 2031.</p><p>Dublin now argues that the burden of the notes is too great, and it should be allowed to exchange them for loans from the European Financial Stability Fund, repayable over at least 30 years at a lower interest rate. Europe, though, refuses to accept this -- and says Ireland should instead pay its next interest rate payment, worth €3.1bn.</p><p>And thus there has been deadlock. The FT (<a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2012/03/qa-irish-promises-and-promissory-notes/#axzz1pCOxwaGR\">which also wrote a good Q&amp;A on this yesterday</a>) published an leader comment today urging the EU to accept Dublin's request, and <strong>Let Ireland Succeed</strong>.</p><p>So back to Noonan. On a trip to Paris today, he said he is hopeful of a deal by the end of 2012 that would keep the new interest rate \"quite low\". Noonan told reporters that:</p><blockquote><p>We would like if it was finished in calendar 2012. With the kind of arrangements we have in mind, there are advantages to having it at the<br />back end of the year.</p></blockquote><p>Noonan also conceded that Ireland will revise its official growth targets down soon. That would bring them back into line with analyst forecasts, which suggest GDP will expand by just 0.7% in 2012 (not the 1.3% currently inked in).</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.35pm:</span> EU taskforce chief <strong>Horst Reichenbach</strong> appeared to be in cheerful - if measured - mood at the press conference where its quarterly report was formally unveiled this lunchtime (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating#block-18\">12.45pm</a>) <strong>Helena Smith</strong> tells me.</p><p>We'll have a full report from Reichenbach shortly, but first <strong>Helena</strong> has an update on the press conference just given by Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister (as mentioned at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/15/eurozone-crisis-greece-uk-fitch-rating#block-19\">1.03pm</a>).  <br /> <br />She writes:</p><blockquote><p>In the wake of Evangelos Venizelos' maiden appearance as leader-elect of the socialist Pasok party, Greek media are insisting that he wants to be called - and should now be referred to - as \"Vangelis\", a more common touch that will go down \"well with the people.\" Obviously, the French-trained law professor, a big fan of Winston Churchill, has also learned a lesson or two from our very own David \"Dave\" Cameron.</p></blockquote><p><br />  <br />Our colleague Rob McSweeney points out that \"Vangelis\" is also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangelis\">the Greek composer</a> who wrote the music for <strong><em>Chariots of Fire</em></strong> and <strong><em>Blade Runner</em></strong>. Perhaps Venizelos is hoping that some of the glamour will rub off....</p><p>Anyway, <strong>Helena</strong> continues that:</p><blockquote><p>Venizelos reiterated that he will step down from his post at the finance ministry on Monday. But it has yet to be decided who will replace him. With the national Unity government expected to be in power for a matter of weeks it was thought that Lucas Papademos, the technocrat prime minister and former vice president of the European Central Bank would assume the position. <br /> <br />A senior Papademos aide said: \"That is one possibility but it has still not been decided. At this point we just don't know.\" <br /> <br />The coalition government has a raft of reforms - at least nine at the last count -- that it has to pass before parliament can be dissolved.   The second adjustment program, also known Greecec's second bailout or rescue package, similarly has to be ratified by the 300-seat House.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 21 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387408756'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/3/15/1331810244464/Ukraine-flag-001.jpg' alt='Ukraine flag' width='60' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.01pm:</span> More developments in Ukraine.

Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, has said he would prefer Greece to take a leaf out of Italy's book and remain under the stewardship of its technocrat prime minister, Lucas Papademos.  </p><p>But senior officials cautioned against taking the poll results too seriously.</p><p>One insider told <strong>Helena</strong>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />At this point in time polls should not be trusted</p><p>The options aren't clear.

The company said the outflow was far ahead of its target of 1,800 barrels at the well in the Barryroe oil field.</p><p>Providence also says the well has shown a rate of 2.93m standard cubic feet per day, which could eventually yield around 4,000 standard barrels per day.</p><p>At present price levels, this would be equivalent to a market price at around $500,000. A recent audit suggested that the reservoir could have a total capacity of almost 1bn barrels – which are currently selling for around $125 per barrel.</p></blockquote><p>Providence says that mineral analysis has confirmed that the oil is light sweet, and is 'highly mobile', which should allow for relatively straightforward extraction. It also wants to drill another five offshore wells.</p><p>The company is run by Tony O'Reilly junior, son of the former rugby player and media magnate.

We can't afford to do that, and that is why there will be no unfunded giveaways in next week's budget.</p></blockquote><p>And here's how Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, responded:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think the credit rating agencies are a weather vane – they tell you the direction in which things are moving. And the UK going on to a negative watch shows that there's a growing worry that our economy's not growing, that unemployment's rising, that our borrowing is not coming down as George Osborne had planned. Now I've said to George Osborne always, don't set your policies by the credit rating agencies, but they are a weather vane and they say the wind is blowing in a difficult direction for the British economy. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.32am:</span> City analysts are in general agreement that Fitch's warning has sunk any lingering possibility that George Osborne might announce any giveaways in next week's budget. Here's a roundup of some early comments:</p><h2>Investec</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />While satisfied with the government's fiscal efforts, the outlook change is put down to still high deficit and increasing indebtedness leaving the UK vulnerable to further adverse economic shocks. The negative outlook represents a slightly higher than 50% change of a rating downgrade over the next two years according to Fitch and the rating agency does not expect to resolve the negative outlook until 2014.</p></blockquote><h2>Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets:</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Any thoughts in some parts that the chancellor might be tempted to embark on a bit of a budget giveaway next week as a result of coming in under his borrowing forecasts for 2011 are very likely to be put to one side after last night's warning. The agency warned that the UK has very limited space to absorb further adverse economic shocks. </p></blockquote><h2>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />The move by Fitch could not come at a more telling time for Chancellor George Osborne as he enters into the final planning stages for next Wednesday's budget. Fitch's move heaps further pressure on the chancellor to stick to his fiscal austerity plans and to resist any temptation for unfunded giveaways.</p></blockquote><h2>Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I still don't think that any of the agencies would dare downgrade the UK in the Queen's diamond jubilee year … that would just be rude.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.19am:</span> If you missed Fitch's announcement that it had put the UK credit rating on negative outlook last night, here's how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/14/fitch-uk-aaa-rating-at-risk\">my colleague Heather Stewart reported it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>George Osborne faced fresh questions about the credibility of his austerity policies just days before the budget on Wednesday night, when Fitch became the second of the major credit ratings agencies to warn that the UK's coveted AAA-rating is at risk.</p><p>Echoing the recent decision by Moody's to place the UK on so-called \"negative watch\", which signals that it could be stripped of AAA status, Fitch said a weaker than expected recovery in the economy could jeopardise Osborne's chances of tackling the debt burden.</p></blockquote><p>Fitch identified the eurozone debt crisis as a key threat to the government's tax and spending forecasts, along with the danger that the 'supply capacity' of the economy has suffered permanent damage (which would mean Britain would struggle to post solid growth).</p><p>It's important to note that Fitch isn't urging Osborne to change his fiscal plans. Indeed, Treasury officials were quick to point out that Fitch warned that any \"discretionary fiscal easing\" (ie, ditching the current deficit-reduction plans) would also probably lead to the AAA being cut.</p><!-- Block 1 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.15am:</span> Good morning, and welcome to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/14/eurozone-crisis-markets-rally-greece\">our rolling coverage of the European debt crisis</a>.</p><p>Today, the taskforce sent to Greece by the EU will be giving its quarterly update.

The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist at the World Bank, is another. Parker, a regular visitor to Greece, would often speak to Papandreou several times a day publicly acknowledging that their discussions could go on \"for hours\" at times of crises [for example when the Papandreou government faced a vote of confidence over unpopular spending cuts and other austerity measures]. In June 2011 he told the Boston based radio station WGBH News: \"We think Greece is actually on target to start exiting its recession next year.\"  </p><p>What has never been publicly acknowledged is the role US academics played in advising Papandreou to take the decision to hold a referendum over the bailout [the second in as many years] Athens finally received after months of tortuous negotiations with the EU last October.</p><p>Papandreou's bombshell annoucement last November that he would put the hard-won plan to \"referendum\" sent shockwaves through Europe, markets plummeting and quickly lead to a brash dressing down of the socialist leader by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy in Cannes, France. After that, with Europe's power couple losing all trust in him, Papandreou was forced to step aside.

He wrote:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />There is a precedent. It is not a pretty one. When the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed there was a single currency over a huge area covering much of what is now Euroland. In this case the rather Germanic Austrians were in charge (or rather were in charge until their empire collapsed).</p><p>What they did was put troops on all the borders and made it illegal to take cash (or wire cash!) across borders.

But the quid pro quo is that the debt-stricken country also announces €11.5bn in further cuts to reign in public finances.<br /> <br />It should be recalled that the Democratic Left has demanded that Greece steadily \"de-link\" itself from the controversial conditions it has signed up to in its latest €130bn loan agreement with international creditors. How this will happen remains to be seen.</p></blockquote><p>Helena adds that Wolfgang Schäuble's comments this morning (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/14/eurozone-crisis-greek-exit-markets#block-16\">see 11.03am</a>) that Greece needs help getting 'back to its feet' have raised hopes of a change in attitude by Berlin.</p><p>Regarding a coalition governmentt, there were similar rumours on Thursday evening when Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos called for a unity government.

Once the government is formed, troika officials will return to the Greek capital to review the financial progress made.</p><p>Papademos said the political uncertainty was not only hindering headway but putting immense pressure on Greece's banking system and, with it, the nation's cash-starved real economy. Another six weeks of instability following elections on June 17 – their most likely date – will aggravate the situation considerably, the macro-economist wrote in the note.   </p><p>The outgoing finance minister Filippos Sachinidis (although invested with no real power) is expected to address the growing concern over Greece's leaderless state when he attends the Ecofin meeting in Brussels later today.

New Democracy and Pasok, the parties now widely branded as 'pro-European' for their support of the unpopular austerity and structural reforms demanded by the EU and IMF in return for aid, say Syriza's cooperation (even if it is just tolerating the government) is essential if the new government is not to be constantly obstructed by anti-austerity strikes and protests.  </p><p>The leaders – without Tsipras it would seem – will meet around the negotiating table again at 7:30 PM local time.

This will lead to a cessation of troika payments, but would not of itself constitute Greek exclusion from the Euro area, provided Greek banks continue to enjoy access to ECB facilities. Such a scenario is consistent with our forecast for European macro variables and asset prices.</p><p>At the same time, there will also be (slow) progress toward deeper policy integration (financial market and banking regulations, fiscal coordination, and ex ante risk-sharing), in order to build the firewall necessary to make the Euro area resilient to a possible future Greek exit. In this scenario, the very large insurance premium priced into US Treasuries and German Bunds should gradually dissipate. Equities would likely rise, but initially only modestly given the continued weak growth picture.</p></blockquote><h2>Scenario #2: Fast exit; Greece walks away</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Were Greece to unilaterally exit and introduce its own currency, the ECB would presumably halt the flow of Euro liquidity to Greece. Greece would be cut off from capital markets, forcing the government to a primary cash balance. The knock-on dislocations to the real economy could lower Euro area GDP by up to 2 percentage points, even assuming that robust counter measures are taken by the policy authorities. Our expectation would be that the policy response would be substantial. The hit to earnings expectations would likely push the SXXP down to 225, although uncertainty could push the ERP even higher (from 8.7% currently), pushing the SXXP back to at least the 215 low of last September or more and 10-yr rates to as low as 1.5% and 1.0% in the US and Germany respectively.</p></blockquote><h2>Scenario #3: Slow exit; Greece is excluded</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There is no legal mechanism to force Greece out, but in practice it would be possible de facto by denying Greek banks access to ECB facilities. We see this as less likely than #1 but more likely than #2; it is more market friendly than #2 being a more \"managed\" exercise. Most likely, peripheral countries' would have received assurance that the ECB will intervene in bond markets to limit contagion preventing a sharp widening in spreads. The likely hit to GDP of up to 1% is already discounted in equities although uncertainty may result in an initial overshoot. If the policy response was powerful, we could see a strong rally from any lower levels.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 13 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390810260'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/12/1305203064788/Live-blog-news-flash-001.jpg' alt='Live blog: news flash newsflash' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.38am:</span> David Cameron is to meet with <strong>Sir Mervyn King</strong>, the governor of the Bank of England, and <strong>Lord Adair Turner</strong>, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, this afternoon to discuss the eurozone crisis.</p><p>We understand that the meeting is taking place at Number 10 Downing Street.</p><p>Senior representatives from the Treasury, the third part of Britain's Tripartite system of financial regulation, will also be attending.</p><p>Sources close to the situation are indicating that the talks are not a major event, but it's an interesting development.

This could be critical.</p> <p>&bull; Possible short-term LTRO-type improvement in market sentiment and risk appetite.</p> <p>&bull; If improvement in sentiment lasts more than a few months, previously deferred spending could come back on line (reduced uncertainty)</p> <p>&bull; Limited impact on the money supply. Banks will be the main sellers of short-term securities &ndash; scheme unlikely to prompt &lsquo;portfolio rebalancing&rsquo;</p> <p>&bull; ESM support comes with strict austerity demands. This could offset benefits of lower yields</p> <h2>Areas where scheme could fall down:</h2> <p>1. Will Spain and Italy actually apply for a bailout? (Political suicide)</p> <p>2. Will the ECB buy long-enough dated bonds? Draghi suggests<br />could be very short term, presumably because Germans worried<br />about &lsquo;debt monetization&rsquo;</p> <p>3.Will the scheme be on a large enough scale? Ideally explicitly<br />unlimited, or ECB will have to prove its intent by starting on big scale.<br />(Transparent yield targets helpful but not essential or likely)</p> <p>4. How will ECB credibly deal with seniority concerns? [<em>Senior creditors have priority over repayments, so other holders of, say, Spanish debt would be further down the queue</em>].</p> <p>5. Lack of ESM support. ESM doesn&rsquo;t have the firepower to credibly<br />keep Italian and Spanish bond yields down.</p> <p>6. Will the scheme stay in place for long enough? Will the ECB keep<br />rolling it over? What happens if countries fail to conform to ESM<br />bailout requirements? (Does bond-buying stop?)</p> <p>........</p> <p>Overall, Lombard Street argues that an ECB bond-buying plan would push down short-term borrowing costs (assuming the Bundesbank doesn't block it), but would do little to really fix the crisis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We always come back to a simple point &ndash; without economic growth, there can be no end to the euro crisis.

This is not because it has started lending again, but because these loans have been \"discovered\" at what used to be Bancaja, one of several savings banks which came together to form Bankia.</p> <p>The other banks are CatalunyaBanc, NCG Banco/Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia. All are expected to offload their toxic real estate onto the new bad bank which will be set up by the end of November as part of the euro zone rescue deal. Other banks that take rescue money may also offload their dodgy real estate loans and foreclosed properties onto the \"bad bank\", which will have up to 15 years to sell them and try to make a profit.</p> <p>Some &euro;28bn's worth of property has already been foreclosed by these banks, meaning that they now own it. But how much is it really worth on a market in which building land, for example, is largely illiquid and impossible to sell? The four banks currently own land that was nominally worth &euro;12.5bn. The bad bank, presumably, will not pay them nearly that much.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5045dad7c0e35a003915c3c3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-05T09:25:59.311+01:00\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Commission has declined to get into a slanging match with Moody's, the FT's Peter Spiegel reports from Brussels....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/status/242929672227282944\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>At <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23EU\"><s>#</s><b>EU</b></a> Commission's midday presser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecspokessimon\"><s>@</s><b>ecspokessimon</b></a> won't comment on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Moodys\"><s>#</s><b>Moodys</b></a> change in EU ratings outlook to negative.</p>&mdash; Peter Spiegel (@SpiegelPeter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/status/242929672227282944\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-04T10:18:41+00:00\">September 4, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5045d76558f923c82113b899\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-05T09:25:59.311+01:00\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pensioners protest in Athens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A group of pensioners have reportedly stormed the Health Ministry in Athens today, in protest at state cutbacks that have driven up the price of medicines and left many people unable to afford treatment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_04/09/2012_459616\">eKathimerini.com reports</a> that \"a few dozen pensioners\" demanded a meeting with health minister Andreas Lykourentzos, and briefly scuffled with police.</p> <p>Lykourentzos apparently declined to meet with the group, who also shouted slogans outside the ministry.</p> <p>Here are some photos from the scene:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ee3f1848-329b-4a0d-b62c-0d2fed1f5cee\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346753806874/de06c402-fcd8-438d-bfee-20159cfa5369-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A pensioner shouts slogans in front of the Health Ministry during an anti-austerity rally in Athens September 4, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The banner reads \"NO\".

The drop in revenues is more than 50% compared to the summer of 2010. My trip also coincided with the clearance of the tax returns for the 2011 tax year. Families that received last year minor tax rebates for their 2010 income, this year have to pay in the region of 2,000 euros extra as a result of the various tax measures the Greek government had to implement in a bid to comply with the program&rsquo;s targets and secure the disbursement of bailout funds necessary to continue basic state functions.

There may be official statements or briefings late tonight, or there may be little substantive.</p><p>So we're going to shut down the live blog, while reserving the right to leap back into life if events demand it</p><p><strong>Here's a closing summary of the key developments:</strong></p><p><strong>EU leaders have begun holding an informal summit in Brussels tonight, to discuss ways to stimulate the European economy.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-38\">The talks</a> will see proposals for growth discussed, including giving extra funds for the European Investment Bank, and liberating European labour markets. France is expected to push for eurobonds, but Germany was clear today that this will not be accepted at the present time. Angela Merkel set the tone, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-36\">saying</a> she didn't expect any decisions tonight.</p><p><strong>The German central bank shook Brussels ahead of the talks, by claiming that a Greek exit would be 'manageable'</strong> The Bundesbank argued that allowing Greece more slack over austerity would be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-28\">more damaging to the eurozone than a Grexit</a>, saying Greece must bear the consequences of failure to comply with its obligations.</p><p><strong>Athens denied that the rest of the eurozone was making contingency plans for Greece to quit the euro.</strong> The Hellenic Treasury <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-34\">said</a> that such claims were damaging, after Reuters reported that officials agreed on Monday to start making preparations. The situation remains unclear tonight, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-35\">Belgium arguing</a> that it was irresponsible to say that there were NOT plans in place. David Cameron also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-19\">chipped in</a>, saying June's election was a vote on Greece's eurozone future.</p><p><strong>Financial markets tumbled again</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/23/eurozone-crisis-markets-summit-eurobonds#block-32\">In London the FTSE 100 ended 2.5% down at 5266</a>, wiping another £35bn of the biggest listed companies in the City. Other European markets suffered too, with the French CAC finishing just above the 3000 mark. The euro also fell again, hitting new 21-month lows against the US dollar.

Short-selling bans on banking and insurance stocks by financial authorities in Rome and Madrid are a sure sign that all is not well, although I fear that these restrictions will only offer the most temporary of respites. After the summit in June that provided a brief burst of euphoria, there were mutterings that the crisis was not over, and the pessimists have now been proved right.</p> <p><br /> We may rapidly be approaching a decisive moment for the eurozone; previous bailouts were of smaller countries that were of manageable size. Spain is a different order of magnitude entirely, and it may not be possible to rescue this economy in the same way that Greece, Ireland and Portugal were bailed out. Eurozone leaders will likely hold yet another summit, but they will need more than fine words if they are to truly save the single currency.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-500d68b8b579b8fa1c624345\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T17:19:12.087+01:00\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, has been dampening speculation there might be an emergency European summit following the events of recent days.</strong></p> <p>Speaking after a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Monti said it was not yet time for such a summit, and anyway, the decision to call one was in the hands of the EU council president, Herman Van Rompuy.</p> <p>Monti also said it would be helpful if the European Central Bank pumped fresh funds into the eurozone economy but again, there was no immediate need for such a move. (The ECB's bond buying programme seems to have dried up, by the way. Last week there were no purchases under the securities markets programme, keeping the total bond buys at &euro;211.5bn.)</p> <p>So no panic, nothing to see here. Somehow don't think the markets are going to be terribly reassured by all that, if that was the aim. Even if past summits have tended to produce only a temporary burst of optimism, before markets decided there was nothing concrete agreed after all.</p> <p>Meanwhile both Monti and Putin said after their meeting that <strong>Russia has no intention of reducing the share of euros in its reserves,</strong> despite the current pressure on the single currency.

He warned that:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Unless structural reforms are undertaken, it will be difficult to keep the eurozone together.</p></blockquote><p>In Frankfurt, meanwhile, Weidmann denied being at odds with Draghi. He said there was no need to unwind the ECB's  \"non-standard measures\" immediately. But he wants clear discussions of how and when to exit these measures, and insisted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I would describe my personal relationship [with Draghi]....as very good.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387297110'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2010/5/5/1273067880031/Live-blog---Germany-flag-001.jpg' alt='Live blog - Germany flag' width='60' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.21pm:</span> Hopes that Germany will avoid recession were bolstered by the news today that German investor confidence rose for the fourth month in a row, hitting the highest level since mid-2010.</p><p>The ZEW institute said its confidence index rose to 22.3 points in March from 5.4 in February, a better performance than the rise to around 12 that economists had expected and the best since June 2010.</p><p>ZEW president <strong>Wolfgang Franz</strong> said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In Germany, due to the good employment situation, domestic demand is likely to continue to stimulate growth.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.55am:</span> A remarkable photograph of John-Claude Juncker appearing to throttle Spain's finance minister is circulating today.</p><p>The picture, taken in Brussels yesterday, shows the the eurogroup president with both hands around the neck of Luis de Guindos.

The French <strong>CAC</strong> and the German <strong>DAX</strong> are both up just over 1%.</p><p>Any relief over Greece may be only short-term. R<strong>ebecca O'Keeffe</strong>, head of investment at <strong>Interactive Investor</strong>, said traders are already talking about how long we will have to wait for the next crisis:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Before the ink is even dry on Greece's second bailout, the question that is being asked is how long it will take before Europe has to go into round three, and who the main player in round three will be? Current favourite is Spain, where the focus of attention has swiftly moved, and their deficit reduction plans.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.45am:</span> Britain's exports to non-EU countries posted a record increase in January, according to the latest UK trade figures, released at 9.30am.</p><p>Overall, the figures show that Britain's deficit with the rest of the world has increased, but by less than expected. The total balance of goods and services hit -£1.762bn in January, up from -£1.217bn in December.</p><p>As usual, a large deficit in exports vs imports of physical goods was partly countered by a large surplus in services. Here's the data for January:</p><p><strong>Goods balance</strong>         -£7.532bn (vs -£7.184bn in December)<br />    <strong>Exports</strong>             £26.063bn (vs £25.563bn in December) <br />    <strong>Imports</strong>  £33.595bn  (vs £32.747bn in December)     <br /><strong>Services balance</strong>       £5.786bn (vs 5.951bn in December)     </p><p><strong>Total trade balance</strong>   -£1.762bn  (vs -£1.217bn in December)</p><p>Economists reckon that the data is encouraging, showing that UK industry is coping quite well in the face of the eurocrisis. George Osborne should also be cheered. Philip Shaw of Investec said the figures were \"fairly encouraging\" for deficit reduction.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.28am:</span> Has the EU opened a can of worms by agreeing that Spain shouldn't be forced to stick to its original deficit targets (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/13/eurozone-crisis-greek-deal-spain-austerity#block-2\">see 8.12am for details</a>)?</p><p><strong>Sony Kapoor</strong>, managing director of the Re-Define economic thinktank, argues that Spain is now the 'test case' for how Europe attempts to control the budgets of member states, in the brave new world of the <strong>Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance</strong> (the 'fiscal pact').</p><p><strong>Kapoor</strong> said we should:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Expect the battle about permissible levels of Spanish deficits to be replayed across a growing number of Euro area Member States.</p><p>Efforts to cut deficits too quickly in Spain could easily turn self-defeating particularly given the record levels of unemployment, the fragile state of the housing market and the weakness of the banking system.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Elisabeth Afseth</strong> of Investec said Mariano Rajoy had been given a 'telling off' for setting unilateral deficit targets last month (heck, he's only the prime minister), and also queried whether the fiscal compact had much teeth -- as many European countries failed to stick to the dusty old Stability and Growth Pact (France and Germany, for example).</p><p><strong>Afseth</strong> said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>As all women know a compact is a concealer and foundation all in one (some would argue the fiscal compact is a better concealer than foundation).

The EU now wants Spain to cut its deficit in 2012 to <strong>5.3% of GDP</strong> this year. That's less taxing than the previous target of <strong>4.4%</strong>, but harder than <strong>5.8% of GDP</strong> that the Madrid government set as its new target last month.</p><p>Jean-Claude Juncker, chair of the eurogroup, argued it was vital that Spain gets its deficit in 2013 down to 3% of GDP by making tough decisions this year. He said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It will be the responsibility of the Spanish authorities to choose the initiatives that will have to be taken in order to bring down the budgetary deficit in 2012, what is most important is what is the target for 2013.</p><p>What is less important, but nevertheless important, are the avenues chosen in 2012.</p></blockquote><p>Spain's deficit is a key issue because the country came nowhere close to hitting its targets in 2011. Last year's deficit came in at 8.5%, far above the 6.0% goal. That was mainly because its regional governments failed to achieve their own targets.</p><p>Juncker appeared to rule out penalising Spain for last year's performance, indicating that was consigned to history.

Work was everybody's subject matter , but it seemed to go on in the background. Once, while supposedly covering accountancy, I lunched with some very senior City figures and the subject never once came up; instead, we discussed life, literature, railways, philosophy, anything but accountancy.</p><p>Everybody seemed to have quietly agreed that money itself was important but boring. What money did was interesting, as was life, literature etc, but the tedious shuffling of paper was nothing.</p></blockquote><p>Alas, this gentle world withered when the Big Bang ushered in an era of \"computers, pesto chicken sandwiches at the desk and fraudulent algorithms\"....</p><p>...not forgetting \"hyper-professionalism, the glorification of misguided expertise and a City-wide determination to undermine the principles of the free market\".</p><p>In conclusion, <strong>Appleyard</strong> argues:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A long lunch meant you were doing harm to nobody but yourself; it meant you weren't spending your time thinking of new and ingenious ways of shuffling paper which is now all that the City really does. So save the euro, save Greece, create jobs, go to lunch and don't come back until four at the earliest.</p></blockquote><p>You have your orders....</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.46pm:</span> Today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/03/eurozone-debt-crisis-ftse100#block-7\">drop in German unemployment to a post-reunification low</a> has been welcomed by the country's  politicians, and prompted several analysts to explain why the Germany economy is faring so well.</p><p>Politics first. Economy minister <strong>Philipp Roesler</strong> proudly declared that 2011 has been \"the most successful since German unification for working people.\" He continued that:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Demand for labour remains very high, despite the current economic risks.</p><p>Overall, the upturn in employment should continue, albeit at a slower rate. The labour market remains one of the main pillars of our economy.</p></blockquote><p>But why didn't the escalating eurozone crisis, and fears of a global downturn, push up unemployment in Germany?</p><p><strong>Andreas Rees</strong>, chief German economist at <strong>UniCredit</strong>, argues that mild conditions in December helped the construction sector. In addition, firms have plenty of orders to fill, as Rees explained:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Companies are still sitting on a huge pile of backlog orders, thereby keeping the labour market going.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Timo Klein</strong> of <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong> agrees that the weather was a factor:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Milder-than-usual winter conditions probably helped December data additionally, so that it should still be expected that the economic slowdown observed since about mid-2011 will be reflected in less benign numbers during 2012.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Eckart Tuchtfeld</strong> of <strong>Commerzbank</strong> reckons that German firms are still confident enough about economic prospects to keep hiring this year.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.13pm:</span> Thanks to all of you who have offered predictions for the eurocrisis, and the wider financial world, in 2012.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/AussieAnalyst\"><strong>AussieAnalyst</strong></a> provided the most comprehensive list of forecasts.

She writes </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> In my opinion, despite imposed austerity, (or because of it) the amount that governments need to raise will become significantly larger as the year progresses.  Experience teaches us that once government finances start to deteriorate, they do so with alarming speed, which economists and politicians always tend to significantly under estimate.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.50pm:</span> BCG's Louise Cooper points out that Spain has already admitted its debt is worse than expected while Ireland's finances are also deteriorating. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />Why do government finances deteriorate so rapidly?  First with slower growth, comes the double whammy of less taxation revenue in and more spending out, which means government debt is highly sensitive to economic growth (and forecasts for growth for 2012 have been downgraded a lot in the last couple of months).  Add to this, higher interest charges when markets lose confidence in a country which can prove very expensive.  In difficult times, forecasts can prove wildly optimistic and numbers start looking ugly really quickly. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.52pm:</span> To just continue with Louise Cooper for a moment, she also points out that banks have \"massive funding needs\" during 2012 - some $665bn of debt comes due in the first half of the year.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Once the issuance from banks starts, there will be massive scrutiny of each bond, its terms, and how the deal went.  Banks have massive funding needs, and how they finance themselves will be a key question for 2012.  Even with the ECB accepting low quality collateral on its loans and offering three year money, interbank markets are still frozen with fear prevalent. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.14pm:</span> Data from the European Central Bank earlier on Tuesday showed that banks reduced their use of one week funding by €15bn. Even so, 138 banks borrowed €130bn for seven days. But, the reduction in the need for short-term money need not be sign that the tensions are easing as the ECB has recently started lending to banks for three years.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.38pm:</span> So, Wall Street has opened. The Dow Jones index is up almost 1% at the open - some 114 points to 12,332.<br />In London, the FTSE 100 is up 1.6% - or 90 points - at 5,663.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.48pm:</span> Turning to the ratings agencies, when Standard &amp; Poor's put almost the entire eurozone on review for a possible downgrade in December, the markets had expected France to be stripped of its Triple A debt rating even before Christmas. Well the festive season has ended and 2012 has got underway, and France is still Triple A rated. A government official has started the new year by telling the Wall Street Journal that the country has not been notified of change to the crucial rating - which might indicate that the ratings are still under review.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/05/eurozone-credit-downgrade-germany-france\">Here</a> is the original Guardian story on the threat of the ratings downgrade to 15 of the 17 countries in the eurozone.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.05pm:</span> Stronger than expected economic data out of the US has helped the FTSE 100 put on 100 points to trade 1.8% higher at 5,674. In November, US construction spending was the highest since June 2010 at $807bn and private construction spending at $522bn was at its highest since December 2009.</p><p>The Dow Jones index is up more than 2%, after earlier being bolstered by better than expected economic news out of China and Germany.  The 1.2% rise in constuction spending in November, in the US, compares with expectations for 0.5%.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.21pm:</span> Reaction to the US data - not only construction spending but also the ISM manufacturing index which rose to 53.9 in December from 52.7 in November -  is coming in. </p><p>Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics, writes</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The rise in the ISM index to a six-month high means it has now reversed almost all of the fall to 50.6 seen last summer...At face value, it is already consistent with annualised GDP growth of between 2.5% and 3%. This sits comfortably with other data suggesting that the economy is gaining traction. </p><p>Despite the downward revision to the rise in construction spending in October (now -0.2% m/m versus +0.8% previously), the 1.2% m/m gain in November suggests that residential investment rose in the fourth quarter as a whole. And data released just before the turn of the year showed that even consumers have become a little more upbeat. </p><p>We are expecting annualised GDP growth in the fourth-quarter of around 2.5%, up from 1.8% in the third.</p><p>That all said, it is hard to see the US economy strengthening this year when the euro-zone is on the cusp of a potentially severe recession and when growth in Asia is set to slow. As such, 2012 will be another challenging year for the US economy, perhaps resulting in GDP growth of no more than 1.5%.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.42pm:</span> The UK's <a href=\"http://www.dmo.gov.uk/\">debt management office</a> has just announced it will sell £3.7bn of government bonds, known as gilts, on January 10 and January 11. Some £700m of these will be index-linked.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.50pm:</span> It is also worth pointing out that Europe's bailout fund - the European Financial Stability Fund- is also planning to issue bonds too. It plans to issue €3bn of three year bonds and is reliant on the top notch ratings of the main players in the eurozone - France, as mentioned earlier, and Germany, for instance - for its own Triple A rating. It too has been warned it could be stripped of its crucial rating. The EFSF said it would be it first three year bond and that it would completes issuances on the short term by the EFSF's recently-launched bill programme and the 5- and 10-year benchmark issues placed last year.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.21pm:</span> While France has been denying it that any downgrade of its rating by S&amp;P is imminent, rival ratings agency Fitch has been analysing Spain's banks. Fitch has concluded the outlook is negative for the major Spanish banks and also revised down its forecasts for economic growth in 2012 and 2013 to  0.0% and 1.0%, respectively, revised down from 0.5% and 1.5%.</p><p>Maria Jose Lockerbie, managing director in Fitch's financial institutions group, said</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />A further intensification of the eurozone crisis, a deteriorating macro environment within Spain and across Europe, increased market volatility and risk aversion, could negatively affect bank credit profiles</p></blockquote><p>Fitch points out that the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio for the entire sector stood at 7.2% at end-September 2011 and that for commercial property and other real estate was around 18%. However, the  NPL ratio for residential mortgages was 2.4% at end-June 2011 and is not expected to worsen significantly - despite the high level of Spanish employment.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.32pm:</span> The ECB has also named the successor to Jürgen Stark, the chief economist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/09/stark-ecb-resignation-sends-markets-reeling\">whose resignation in September</a> sparked all manner of conspiracy theories. He is to replaced by <a href=\"http://www.ecb.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvpraet.en.html\">Peter Praet</a>, a Belgian who has been a board member of the ECB since June 2011.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.40pm:</span> London's first trading day of the year has ended and the FTSE has found an upbeat tone, ending more than 2% up on the day at 5699, a gain of 127 points.  Stock markets across the eurozone are also higher. Spain has scraped into positive terrority, rising 0.2%, while Portugal is up 1.7% and Italy 1.2%. The stock markets in German and France are up 1.5% and 0.7% respectively.</p><p>The tone for early trading was set by economic news out China, which was then reinforced by fresh signs that the US economy ended 2011 on a more positive note.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.09pm:</span> European stock markets have closed at their highest levels for five months.

A conversation with the troika will take place next week. They must also agree so I am not ready today to say any more about it,” said Stournaras. “I don’t want to commit to anything … today we spoke generally. We will continue the conversation.”  The minister added that the €3bn budget black hole that has emerged this year would definitely be plugged and that by next week €11.5bn would be found.  But the vagueness of statements made after the meeting has left plenty of room for anti-bailout stalwarts to hit back. Within minutes after today’s talks, Alexis Tsipras, firebrand leader of the far left Syriza party, shot back saying the three-party coalition was “lying” about its true intent which was to implement a “catastrophic plan” of yet more austerity measures.  </p><p>“The government is executing orders from the troika and is not serving the public interest,” he said, denouncing the EU, ECB and IMF officials as “a failed committee of employees” who he would refuse to meet. The leader called on the government to request “an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss a new strategic plan for the Greek case.” </p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5006da8158f90c7116d8352b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-03T14:38:36.879+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Europe's financial markets have just closed, with the major markets finishing higher.

But across the board cuts and more tax increases may ultimately be unavoidable, government officials say. </p><p>The state-run news channel ERT quoted a senior finance ministry official this morning as saying “we are trying to avoid it but cannot rule it out. There are voices in the Euro group (of eurozone finance ministers) calling for addition measures, which we are trying to avoid by pointing to the greater-than-expected recession.” Other financial ministry sources said today that the leaders may well agree on a “general outline” of cuts without getting into the detail of what, exactly, they might be. </p></blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-84bd7e49-69da-4d94-9c3e-4e7623481a43\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/6/26/1340714516871/Yannis-Stournaras-Greeces-008.jpg\" alt=\"Yannis Stournaras, Greece's new finance minister\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Yannis Stournaras, Greece's new finance minister.

Under the first scenario favoured by lenders, the cuts will extend over a two-year period starting in 2013. Under the second, favoured by Greece, they will stretch out over a four-year period beginning next year. “It is vital that we show willing and so are preparing two sets of proposals. We realise that international patience is running out,” said one source. </p><p>Stournaras, like all three party leaders, is keen to renegotiate Greece’s latest bailout, firmly believing that after three years of implementation the programme shows little sign of yanking the country out of its economic death spiral. But the Oxford-educated economist says it is crucial that Athens claws back some of its credibility first by keeping to the pledges it made when it signed up to the international rescue package in March. “Once we have shown we are serious we will begin negotiating,” one insider said. </p><p>At the very least Athens wants to prolong the time period over which it will meet deficit reducing targets with many in the government seeing the extension “as a given”. Auditors, however, say prolongation alone is a “huge ask” and may not happen. Greek officials who participated in the fraught negotiations that ultimately sealed the latest rescue package privately admit that the government could be setting itself “and the Greek people” up for huge disappointment. “Our creditors are in no mood to renegotiate,” said a senior official. “To agree on this package in the first place took long enough. All this talk is very dangerous … All of them [party leaders in the government] are playing with fire.” <br></p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5006895358f9673bbacb8204\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-03T14:38:36.879+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some reaction to Germany's record-breaking bond auction (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/18/eurozone-crisis-greece-talks-cuts#block-500685c5c0e339808183c0b5\">see 10.45</a>).</p><p>Bond strategist <strong>Nick Stamenkovic</strong> said the popularity of Germany debt was partly due to last week's interest rate cut from the ECB.</p><p><strong>Stamenkovic</strong> added:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With the economic picture looking so poor at the moment, yields could remain negative at the short end [ie, for lower maturity bonds] for some time to come, and could go even deeper into negative territory.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sony Kapoor</strong> of the <strong>Re-Define</strong> thinktank is concerned by the auction, saying politicians should not take low yields as proof they are handling the crisis well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/status/225528927584661504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Dear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523EU\">#EU</a> leaders, the falling yields r not a sign of success 4 ur non-strategy but a symptom of its deep failure, a sign of desperation!</p>&mdash; Sony Kapoor (@SonyKapoor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/status/225528927584661504\" data-datetime=\"2012-07-18T09:54:21+00:00\">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-500685c5c0e339808183c0b5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-03T14:38:36.879+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Crumbs!

The citizens of Greece are not to blame for the current situation, and yet are having to bear the main burden of it.....</p><p>but, the first hard truth is this: austerity measures and structural reforms can not be circumvented.

What that means is that the Greek State will have no more money in future to pay salaries, to pay pensions, to pay unemployment benefit, to keep the schools and hospitals going.</p><p>People who say that all you have to do is not pay anything back are failing to mention that Greece would then receive no more credit, either from banks or from countries.

Britain has made up less than half the ground lost when output plunged by more than 7% in 2008-09, and Chote said there was a risk that \"you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started\".</p><p>In a separate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/18/greek-leftist-leader-alexis-tsipras\" title=\"\">exclusive interview</a>, Alexis Tsipras, the increasingly powerful 37-year-old Greek politician now regarded by many as holding the future of the euro in his hands, told the Guardian that he was determined \"to stop the experiment\" with austerity policies imposed by Germany. He described the tax increases and spending cuts as a \"crime against the Greek people\".</p><p>The leader of the Syriza party, whose success in last month's general election has led to political paralysis in Athens and a second general election, said he wanted Greece to stay in the euro, but was fighting capitalism. \"On the one side there are workers and a majority of people, and on the other are global capitalists, bankers, profiteers on stock exchanges, the big funds. It's a war between peoples and capitalism ... it is the international financial system, and more especially banks, that are gaining most\".</p><p>The head of the UK's OBR said the deepening crisis in the eurozone could force him to tear up his forecasts, made only two months ago, that Britain would post modest growth of 0.8% this year. \"The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the eurozone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the past recession, and that has consequences both for hitting economic activity in the economy, but also its underlying potential,\" said Chote.</p><p>With economic output in the UK still 4% below its peak level when the recession began in early 2008, the prime minister and the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, have expressed concern in recent days about the vulnerability of Britain to the eurozone.</p><p>Chote said he was particularly concerned about the possibility that a second deep recession would leave permanent scars. \"That means not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again – it goes into a hole and comes out – but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started.\"</p><p>Shares in London closed down for a third week, with the jittery mood in financial markets pushing the FTSE 100 below 5,400 for the first time this year. German and French stock markets were also depressed, with even the much-anticipated stock market debut of Facebook in New York failing to lift spirits.</p><p>Greece's caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikramenos, said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had suggested in a phone call to the Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, on Friday that Greece hold a referendum on its continued membership of the single currency alongside next month's elections, in an apparent attempt to encourage voters to back mainstream parties who support the current austerity programme.</p><p>The German government said that no suggestion of the kind had been made. But the Greek government was insistent, and said that Pikramenos had rejected the suggestion because he does not have the power to call a referendum.</p><p>Merkel's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, said the eurozone crisis could last two more years, while financial market speculation that Greece's days in the euro were numbered cast a shadow over the annual gathering of leaders of the G8 western industrial nations at Camp David. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, voiced his frustration at Europe's leaders, demanding tough action to tackle the crisis.</p><p>In Brussels, the European commission denied comments by Europe's trade minister, Karel de Gucht, that preparations were being made for Greece's departure from the single currency.</p><p>Meanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted that the weak state of Ireland's banks could result in the former Celtic tiger requiring a second bailout, and in Spain there were reports that the government would call in Goldman Sachs to help sort out its banks after 16 suffered credit downgrades on Thursday.</p><p>In an echo of the months leading up to the Lehmans collapse, Mike Smith, chief executive of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said the turmoil in the eurozone meant Australian banks were being frozen out of money markets when seeking funds.</p><p>Chote said there were so many uncertainties around what might happen with Greece and the eurozone that trying to produce firm predictions was not \"particularly helpful\".</p><p>But the OBR has tried to quantify the impact of a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring in the eurozone on Britain – and the figures make grim reading. Britain would be plunged into recession for two years, according to the OBR analysis, published in its most recent economic and fiscal outlook report. There would also be deflation and unemployment would reach almost 11% by 2013-14, with debt subsequently reaching more than 90% of GDP.</p><p>Chote said these projections were of limited value because the eurozone crisis could develop in so many different ways. \"For example, one issue would be, do difficulties in the eurozone make it cheaper or more expensive for the UK government to borrow?\" he said. \"If it makes investors more nervous about risk in general, it might make it more expensive. If they see the UK as more of a safe haven, it might make it less expensive.\"</p>","headline":"UK 'may never fully recover' if Greece exits euro","trailText":"<p>Top forecaster says Britain would

In a speech given in Athens, the German social democrat spoke plainly about the pain suffered by ordinary Greeks, before insisting that austerity could not be avoided.</p><p>Here's the details of <strong>Schulz's</strong> speech:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I understand your despair. I understand your resignation .I understand your anger.</p><p>European solidarity demands that we stand by each other. The citizens of Greece are not to blame for the current situation, and yet are having to bear the main burden of it.....</p><p>but, the first hard truth is this: austerity measures and structural reforms can not be circumvented. No EU country will release the next instalment of the EUR €130bn rescue package unless the next Greek government adheres to the commitments that have already been made.</p><p>If Greece wants the Troika to keep its promise to pay the next instalment, which Greece needs by the end of June at the latest, Greece must also keep its promises</p><p>Trust is founded in the reliability of both partners. If the next Greek government does not keep the promises that have already been made and adhere to the agreements that have already been reached, many people in neighbouring countries will have the impression that Greece does not keep its word.</p><p>If you give up now, the next instalment of the bailout will not be paid. What that means is that the Greek State will have no more money in future to pay salaries, to pay pensions, to pay unemployment benefit, to keep the schools and hospitals going.</p><p>People who say that all you have to do is not pay anything back are failing to mention that Greece would then receive no more credit, either from banks or from countries. Those who say we don't accept the memorandum, but we will stay in the euro zone, nourish a fake hope.</p><p>The people who say that Greece need not abide by the agreements are failing to say that that can lead to only one thing, Greece's departure from the eurozone.</p></blockquote><p>So, it's the same argument as European officials have been making for weeks, but with a more 'human' tone at the start to try and sweeten the austerity pill.</p><p>And despite Brussels officials insisting that they remain impartial and will accept the result of June's election, Schulz's comments must be read as a call to back parties who accept the current financial programme deal, and not to vote for the Syriza coalition. <em>Political impartiality is being stretched... </em></p><p>And, as regular reader <strong>James Wilkins</strong> points out:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />If Martin Schulz manages to scare Greek voters into voting for New Democraty or Pasok so that they can form the next government I doubt it will last long because additional austerity measures are planned in addition to the ones already in place.</p><p> I am fairly sure that NO government will be able to carry them out.</p></blockquote><p>Agreeing the details of those new cutbacks/tax rises will be an early challenge for the next government.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.15pm BST:</span> Fitch has just followed up on last night's Greek downgrade, by cutting its ratings on the country's banks to CCC as well.

The social state has collapsed, one in two youngsters is out of work, there are people leaving en masse, the climate psychologically is one of pessimism, depression, mass suicides.\"</p><p>But while exhausted and battle weary, the nation at the forefront of Europe's escalating debt crisis and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy is also hardened. And, increasingly, they are looking towards Tsipras to lead their fight.</p><p>\"Defeat is the battle that isn't waged,\" says the young politician who almost overnight has seen his radical left coalition party, Syriza, jump from representing fewer than 5% of Greeks to enjoying ratings of more than 25% in polls.</p><p>\"You ask me if I am afraid. I'd be afraid if we continued on this path, a path to social hell … when someone fights there is a big chance that he will win and we are fighting this to win.\"</p><p>Before Greeks went to the polls on 6&nbsp;May, neither Tsipras nor his party were a name to be reckoned with. If anything both were the butt of vague mockery: a former pony-tailed student communist leading a rag-tag band of ex-Trotskyists, Maoists, champagne socialists and greens. Tsipras's assistants – wielding Louis Vuitton bags and fashionable sunglasses – readily admit they are signed up \"militants\" mostly of the anti-globalisation cause.</p><p>But today I am the third person to pass through Tsipras's second-floor parliamentary office. The others have been the German ambassador to Greece and the president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz. As Greeks prepare to head to the polls again on 17 June, Tsipras, the politician poised to win the greatest number of votes – after Syriza came in second place in this month's inconclusive election – is the man everyone wants to see. \"He is not as dangerous as he appears on TV, but he does have some risky positions,\" says Schulz emerging form the talks.</p><p>\"The [upcoming] vote in Greece will decide not just what happens here but what will happen internationally\", adds the German before saying what he really wants to say. \"If the memorandum [loan agreement] is cast in doubt, the payment [of rescue funds from the EU and IMF] to Greece is cast in doubt.\"</p><p>Tsipras, who turns 38 in July, wants me to know that the war is not personal. The enemy is not Berlin, until now the biggest provider of the monumental rescue funds keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat. \"It is not between nations and peoples,\" he says. \"On the one side there are workers and a majority of people and on the other are global capitalists, bankers, profiteers on stock exchanges, the big funds. It's a war between peoples and capitalism … and as in each war what happens on the frontline defines the battle. It will be decisive for the war elsewhere.\"</p><p>Greece, he says, has become a model for the rest of Europe because it was the first country to fall victim to the  enforcement of hard-hitting \"growth through austerity\" policies pursued in the name of resolving the crisis.</p><p>\"It was chosen as the experiment for the enforcement of neo-liberal shock [policies] and Greek people were the guinea pigs,\" he insists.</p><p>\"If the experiment continues, it will be considered successful and the policies will be applied in other countries. That's why it is so important to stop the experiment. It will not just be a victory for Greece but for all of Europe.\"</p><p>Under the current rescue plan, which has subjected the nation to relentless austerity – the average Greek's purchasing power has dropped by 35% – the international financial system, and especially banks, are gaining most, he says. \"Who is surviving, tell me?\" he asks. \"Greeks aren't … The loans are&nbsp;going straight to interest payment and banks.\"</p><p>The other point that Tsipras wants to make is that he is not against the euro or monetary union. Fears that the country is about to exit the eurozone are about terrorising people to keep the status quo, he claims. They are why the nation has seen  \"more then €75bn\" of cash taken out of Greek banks since the outbreak of the crisis in Athens in December 2009.</p><p>But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, should know she has \"a huge historical responsibility\" – a point he will be making when he holds talks with representatives of the German government in Berlin next week.</p><p>\"We are not against a unified Europe or monetary union,\" he insists. \"We don't want to blackmail, we want to persuade our European partners that the way that has been chosen to confront Greece is totally counter-productive. It is like throwing money at a bottomless pit.\"</p><p>Over the past two years, Athens had received two bumper bailouts from the EU and IMF: €110bn in May 2010 and then €130bn in March this year, but the stringent fiscal adjustment programmes demanded in return for the aid are clearly not working, he says.</p><p>If the emphasis is not now put on re-energising Europe's most moribund economy through development and growth, \"in six months we will be forced to discuss a third package and after that a fourth,\" he predicts,</p><p>\"European tax payers should know that if they are giving money to Greece, it should have an effect … it should go towards investments and underwriting growth so that the Greek debt problem can be confronted because with this recipe we are not confronting the debt problem, the real issue.\"</p><p>All this sounds remarkably toned down from the fiery rhetoric Tsipras has come to be associated with – until, that is, the mention of rescue funds drying up if (as seems likely) his party emerges as the governing force in a hung parliament.</p><p>The first thing Syriza will do in power is tear up the controversial \"memorandum of understanding\" Greece signed up to with creditors, which details the onerous conditions under which the country receives quarterly injections of cash.</p><p>The agreement, he says, was reached without the Greek people ever being consulted. And now in the wake of the 6&nbsp;May vote, when more than 70% of those opposing the policies voted for \"anti-bailout\" parties, it is clear it has lost all legitimacy, he insists</p><p>It is a high stakes game but, he argues, Europe is holding the gun because ultimately, under European law, Greece can't be ejected from the 17-nation bloc.</p><p>\"Europeans have to understand that we don't have any intention of pushing ahead with a unilateral move. We will [only] be forced to act if they act unilaterally and make the first move,\" he says.  \"If they don't pay us, if they stop the financing [of loans] then we will not be able to pay creditors. What I am saying is very simple.\"</p><p>And if Athens stops paying its creditors, the problem then takes on a different hue. Greece is in a much stronger position than most think.</p><p>\"Keynes said it many years ago. It's not just the person who borrows but the&nbsp;person who lends who can find himself in a difficult position. If you owe £5,000 to the bank, it's your problem but if you owe £500,000, it's the bank's problem,\" he said. \"This is a common problem. It's our problem. Its Merkel's problem. It's a European problem. Its a world problem.\"</p><p>With his good looks, raven black hair and propensity for rousing oratory, Tsipras comes across more as a pin-up (which is how many in Greece see him) than a saviour, which is how a great deal of others see him.</p><p>His aides add in passing that one of his heroes is Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, with whom he shares the same birthday. Nor does he believe in political tags \"at this time of crisis\".</p><p>But though he appears to be preparing for power and moderating his tone, he says the war will continue.</p>","headline":"Greek

As chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote is the government's independent forecaster-in-chief and the man responsible for checking that George Osborne's budget figures add up. In a wide-ranging interview, Chote discussed the eurozone crisis and much else. Here are the main points.</p><p></p><p><strong>• Chote said Greece leaving the euro could plunge Britain into a recession as bad as the last one, causing long-term damage to the economy.</strong> He stressed the difficulties of forecasting the economic consequences of a Greek exit, but acknowledged there was a danger \"not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again – ie, it goes into a hole and comes out – but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started\".</p><p></p><p><strong>• He said there was no evidence to show that cutting the 50p top rate of tax would promote growth.</strong> \"We didn't feel that there was a strong enough evidence base to say our long-term or medium-term view of the economy is now more optimistic than it was beforehand as a result of that measure,\" he said.</p><p></p><p><strong>• He said current spending on public sector pensions was sustainable in the long-term. </strong>The public finances as a whole would come under pressure in years to come, but the current pension regime was \"not where the problem is coming from\", he said.</p><p></p><p><strong>• He claimed that the OBR was better at producing reliable forecasts than the Treasury used to be.</strong> \"On public sector net borrowing … our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime [when the Treasury was in charge of producing forecasts for the government],\" he said, producing figures showing that seven out of nine of the OBR's borrowing forecasts to date had been shown to be more accurate than Treasury ones were. He also produced figures showing that the OBR's growth forecasts were more reliable than average Treasury ones. Asked to explain why the OBR got it so wrong when it predicted reasonable growth in 2011 and 2012, he said higher-than-expected inflation, particularly from oil prices and food prices, was mainly to blame.</p><p></p><p><strong>• He said the OBR should eventually be allowed to cost opposition policies. </strong>Under current legislation, it is banned from doing this. \"Having independent rigorous analysis of all the political parties' policies is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for public debate, it's a good thing for democracy,\" he said. He also suggested that the current arrangement, which will allow Osborne to go into the election saying his plans have been approved by the OBR while Ed Balls won't be able to make the same claim, was potentially unfair.</p><p></p><p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, which was set up by Osborne after the election, sounds rather grand. But actually Chote's team is only about 20-strong and they operate from a rather poky office on Victoria Street. There are two-bit PR companies with larger headcounts and plusher premises.</p><p>Chote used to run the Institute for Fiscal Studies (employing about 50 people), and helped to establish it as the thinktank most trusted to impartially dissect government and opposition fiscal policies. \"The fact that we looked at every party's plans, and normally said rude things about all of them, contributed to people's sense of our independence and our evenhandedness,\" he said. At the OBR he's more constrained because he's not allowed to comment on opposition policies, and whether they would be better than Osborne's. But in our interview he still managed to say at least two things likely to annoy Osborne (on the 50p top rate of tax, and public sector pensions), and one that will go down badly with Balls (on the reason for growth being much lower than expected). We spoke on Wednesday afternoon. Here's how it went.</p><p></p><h2>Eurozone crisis</h2><p></p><p><strong>Q: At his </strong><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/irspnote160512.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>press conference on Wednesday morning (pdf)</strong></a><strong>, Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, seemed to be saying – and I paraphrase – that it was so difficult trying to work out the impact of Greece leaving the eurozone that there was no point even trying. The OBR's position is different, because in your last </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/March-2012-EFO1.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>economic and fiscal outlook (pdf)</strong></a><strong>, you did try to quantify it. Can you summarise what would happen?</strong></p><p>A: Fundamentally the governor is right, and we've taken a similar approach in most of the recent forecasts that we've done. If you think about the bad outcome for the eurozone, there are so many different ways in which that could unfold that picking any one and working out the consequences of that for the economy and the public finances, and saying that that is representative of the bad outcome, isn't particularly helpful. There's an awful lot of uncertainty. For example, if Greece were to come out, does that make people more confident about the stability and cohesion of what is left? Or are people more nervous because they fear there will be contagion?</p><p>That said, you can say hopefully useful things about the sorts of ways in which greater difficulties in the eurozone might affect the UK and those that might be more or less important to the fiscal position, which is ultimately what we're interested in. The direct economic trade links between the UK and Greece are not that great. So it's less the direct effect than whether it leads to concerns about contagion and the stability of the system as a whole and, crucially, what impact that has on the smooth running of the financial system and the banking system.</p><p>The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the eurozone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the past recession, and that that has consquences both for hitting economic activity in the economy, but also its underlying potential. And it's the latter which has particular difficulties for the fiscal position, because it means not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again – ie, it goes into a hole and comes out – but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started. And that has more lingering, long-term consequences for the public finances.</p><p>What we did in <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/March-2012-EFO1.pdf\" title=\"\">this report (pdf)</a> was to say, for what it's worth, the OECD has come up with a story of how things might turn out. And we looked at that one.</p><p></p><p><strong>And these figures [see page 177] suggest there would be negative growth for two years, deflation in 2013-14, unemployment higher than 10% and that the chancellor would miss his targets.</strong></p><p>That's saying what would happen if this particular novelisation that the OECD came up with last year was to come up. But the point is that it could evolve in so many different ways. For example, one issue would be do difficulties in the eurozone make it cheaper or more expensive for the UK government to borrow? If it makes investors more nervous about risk in general, it might make it more expensive. If they see the UK as more of a safe haven, it might make it less expensive.</p><p></p><p><strong>I suppose the question people really wanted answered is, how bad could it get? Can you answer that?</strong></p><p>Well, no. The problem is that you would be coming up with one story and claiming it was representative. I think Mervyn's view is the right one, that you can't say there's a 10% chance that things will turn out like this. What you can say is let's take a way things could turn out and look what sort of effect it might have.</p><p></p><h2>Reliability of OBR forecasts</h2><p></p><p><strong>That takes us on to forecasting. In your </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/Forecast-evaluation-report-2011.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>forecast evaluation report last year (pdf)</strong></a><strong> you said one of the advantages of having the OBR produce forecasts instead of the Treasury was that people could be confident that \"they are based on (inevitably fallible) professional judgment rather than politically motivated wishful thinking\". How much evidence do you think there is that governments did rig their forecasts?</strong></p><p>\"Rig\" is not a word I would use. The key point about the pre-OBR regime is that these were ministerial forecasts and ministers were entirely entitled to forecast whatever they wanted. It's not as if they were fiddling the numbers. They were their numbers. Certainly if you look at the period for 2002 onwards, the then government published forecasts for public finances that the IFS and the National Institute [of Economic and Social Research] and probably the IMF and the OECD all thought were probably too optimistic.</p><p>Another concern over that period was also the way in which the fiscal rules were written. There was a concern that it was easy to move the goalposts in such a way as to make them easier to hit. So I would not say in the past there's been \"rigging\". But I think there is a concern that governments of all stripes have an incentive to produce forecasts that do contain wishful thinking about the future. The creation of the OBR was, in part, a response to those sort of issues.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it your contention that having the OBR will create better forecasts? Or does it just create forecasts that are subject to the same degree of inaccuracy but people will …</strong></p><p>Think they're inaccurate for the right reasons.</p><p></p><p><strong>Exactly.</strong></p><p>That's a good way of putting it. You might want to distinguish between the forecasts we make for the economy and the forecasts we make for the public finances, tax revenues and spending and budget deficits and things like that. For the economy, we have no privileged secret information about what's going on in the economy that everybody else in the world doesn't have. So there's no reason to believe that we should be better forecasters for the economy than anybody else is.</p><p>What we do have is additional information about what exactly is going on with public spending, what exactly is going on with tax receipts. We're able to have more discussions with people at HMRC about what is going on with tax receipts. So, for the fiscal forecasts, hopefully we are able to use that additional information.</p><p></p><p><strong>When I posted a blog </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/15/robert-chote-office-budget-responsibility\" title=\"\"><strong>asking people to suggest questions I should ask you</strong></a><strong>, I was surprised how negative the comments were. A lot of them [for example, </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16133553\" title=\"\"><strong>Optymystic</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16133907\" title=\"\"><strong>manzo</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16138318\" title=\"\"><strong>hrwaldram</strong></a><strong>] focused on accuracy, with people saying your forecasts are no better, or if anything worse, than the Treasury ones were. On the key indicators, are you doing better than the Treasury or are you doing worse? </strong></p><p>On the fiscal numbers, on public sector net borrowing (PSNB), for what it is worth – and we've only got a couple of years to go on – our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime.</p><p>[At this point Chote produces a chart showing the accuracy of all PSNB forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where real figures are now available. The boxes are coded green if the error is below the average error incurred by the Treasury when it was doing these forecasts, yellow if it's in line with the average Treasury error, and red if it's worse than the average Treasury error. There are nine boxes: seven of them are green, one is yellow and one is red.]</p><p></p><p><strong>But what about growth? If I had asked the people who were raising questions why they thought your forecasts were so bad, I think they would cite growth. Two years ago you were predicting growth of 2%-plus in 2012, and now it's 0.8% and coming down. People look at that and say that shows you're just as useless as the Treasury.</strong></p><p>Judging that is harder because the numbers continue to be revised long after you think you know who's done a good forecast and who's done a bad one. That was very clear in 2010. All the forecasts we produced in 2010 under-estimated economic growth in 2010. If you go back even further in time, when I was writing about the economy for the Independent in the early 1990s, in the recession of the 1990s it looked like the economy had shrunk by 4.3% from top to bottom and it had ended in a double dip. That was the story I was writing on the national accounts of 1993. If you now look at the latest official data for exactly the same period, the recession is 40% shallower and there's no double dip.</p><p></p><p><strong>So do you think if the Treasury had been doing the forecasts in 2010 for 2012, they would have made the same mistake that you made?</strong></p><p>If you look at why growth appears to have been weaker in 2011 than we thought – and indeed I think that every one of the independent forecasters polled at the beginning of 2011, no one had anything as weak as 0.7, which is where we've ended up – the main reason for that appears to be the fact that there were pressures on inflation that were higher than people expected. Things like higher oil prices and food prices were squeezing household incomes, squeezing consumer spending.</p><p>[At this point Chote produces another chart showing the accuracy of all growth forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where the real figures are now available. There are six boxes: three of them are green (ie, better than the average Treasury error), one is yellow (in line with the Treasury average) and two are red (worse than the Treasury average).]</p><p></p><p><strong>You talk quite a lot about how forecasts are inherently unreliable. In your </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/Forecast-evaluation-report-2011.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>forecast evaluation report (pdf)</strong></a><strong> last year you said: \"The chances of any economic or fiscal forecast being accurate in every dimension are infinitesimally small.\"</strong></p><p>That's certainly true. You cannot just say this is difficult, so there's no point even trying. Governments have to take decisions today that have consequences about what things will look like in one, two, three, four years' time. In order to take those decisions in a sensible way, you have to start with some sort of view about how the world is going to look if you don't do anything or if you do do anything. So it is very difficult, but you still have to do it. The key thing that we're trying to demonstrate in the way we do it is, don't bet the farm on any particular view of the economy turning out to be correct. And it's not enough just to say there's uncertainty around the central view that we've set out. What you need to do is say how much does it matter if we're wrong, and in what sort of ways.</p><p></p><h2>Relations with the Treasury</h2><p></p><p><strong>People have criticised the OBR for being too close to Treasury thinking. When I asked people to suggest questions, Polly Toynbee sent me one on Twitter which was: \"Why has the OBR been so wildly optimistic, when Keynesians predicted double dip would be the result of extreme austerity?\"</strong></p><p>And there's another set of views on the other side of the spectrum. We sit down, we puzzle over the data and the information and we reach the best view that we can, whether the Treasury agrees with that or not. Perhaps to my surprise, and to their credit, they don't come and say \"this is our view of the world, you agree, don't you?\" holding a large baseball bat up in the air. We all sit and discuss the uncertainties about what is going on. But at the end of the day the great discipline is transparency. We have to show our working. There will always be people who disagree with the view that you express. That's the nature of economics.</p><p></p><p><strong>Going back to the Treasury, someone on the blog [</strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16134197\" title=\"\"><strong>britannicus</strong></a><strong>] posted this question: \"Is it difficult to maintain an independent and objective stance on the government's fiscal performance when you are married to the Treasury's director general responsible for public spending [Sharon White]?\"</strong></p><p>The short answer is not at all. She's a career civil servant. So she's worked for the previous Labour government, and the Tory government before that. The jobs I've had have involved me being rude about all of them. It has never stopped me in the past and it wouldn't stop me now. Clearly, I felt it was very important when she got that job that we should be transparent about it, so it went straight up on our website when she was appointed and I made sure that the Treasury committee was informed before it happened just so that there weren't any concerns about it.</p><p></p><h2>Allowing the OBR to cost opposition policies</h2><p></p><p><strong>The legislation setting up the OBR says you can't look at the impact of opposition policies. But at some point they're going to review the operation of the OBR. Do you think there's a case for changing the legislation to allow you to cost Ed Balls' policies?</strong></p><p>It is certainly something that parliament should come back to in that five-year review. I said when I was appointed that I thought parliament should be very clear with us whether they wanted us to do that or not. I said if parliament did not give a view one way or another, I would talk about the implications of opposition policies.</p><p>The Australians are setting up a parliamentary budget office as we speak, which is very much focused at providing the research resources for opposition members to be able to go to this body and say: \"I've got a pet plan to change income tax, could you please run the slide-rule over it.\" If you do that it's quite expensive, because you have to have quite a lot of expertise in quite a lot of different areas.</p><p>There's a then even more dramatic example of this in the Netherlands, where every political party in the runup to the election is invited to submit its manifesto to our Dutch equivalent. The Dutch office is multiple times larger than we are, partly because you need to have more resources available to do that.</p><p></p><p><strong>One of the consequences of this system is that George Osborne will be able to stand up and say to the voters, \"here are my budget plans, they've been kitemarked by the OBR\", because he's in government. But Ed Balls won't be able to do that. Do you think there's an inherent unfairness in that?</strong></p><p>I think it's one of the reasons why it would be a jolly good idea to review this when the five-year thing comes up. When this debate was under way when we were being set up, it wasn't as though the government didn't want that question answered and the opposition did. There was no great push from Labour to say the OBR should have this role, partly, I think, because everybody was concerned that dragging us straight into the debate between plan A and plan B would leave you inevitably as though you were picking sides, and that might be very difficult because the body had only just been set up.</p><p>It's entirely reasonable for parliament to want us to establish our credibility and trustworthiness with a narrower mandate before you extend it in that sort of way. I think at the end of the day that having independent rigorous analysis of all the political parties' policies is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for public debate, it's a good thing for democracy.</p><p>You could argue that because the IFS does that to a considerable degree there's less need for that here than there would be in some other countries which don't have IFSes. But I think that would still be a positive thing. But it won't happen on my watch.</p><p></p><p><strong>Are you appointed for …</strong></p><p>It's a fixed five-year period. In principle I could do another five after that. I'm allowed to seek a second term if I want to.</p><p>But it's not just a question of people saying the OBR should do this. The government at the time would need to be willing to allow HMRC and DWP people to work with us in examining those sorts of things. I think it would be a good thing. And certainly from the point of view of IFS, the fact that we looked at every party's plans, and normally said rude things about all of them, contributed to people's sense of our independence and our evenhandedness. Partly because no party has the monopoly of wisdom or folly, so you normally offending all of them some of the time.</p><p></p><h2>Economic effect of cutting the 50p top rate of tax</h2><p></p><p><strong>Is there any evidence that cutting the 50p top rate of tax will be good for the economy in terms of promoting growth because it will make people work harder, or make people come to the UK to invest?</strong></p><p>We didn't think that there was a reason to adjust our medium- or long-term growth forecasts on the basis of that. That was certainly the view that we took back in March.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is that because the evidence is unobtainable? Or is that because that effect probably doesn't apply?</strong></p><p>Well, there's a size issue. When we're thinking about the impact on spending in the economy, we're looking at all the budget measures added together. And if you look at all the measures added together, it was a pretty neutral budget. There were giveaways and there were takeaways. But in most years, and on average over the five years, the takeaways and the giveaways pretty much wash out. So the budget was not doing very much to either inject into or subtract out of the economy additional spending power. The evidence on things like \"will this attract particularly innovative people who will have ongoing implications for productivity growth etc\", again, you would look at the size of the sums of money involved and at the evidence. Certainly, we didn't feel that there was a strong enough evidence base to say our long-term or medium-term view of the economy is now more optimistic than it was beforehand as a result of that measure, or indeed the other measures.</p><p></p><h2>Sustainability of public sector pensions</h2><p></p><p><strong>Let's turn to public sector pensions. You will have followed the debate about whether or not current public sector pensions are sustainable. What's the OBR view on that?</strong></p><p>We last took a view on that debate back in July of last year, which we will update in July this year. The view that we took then was that if you look at the share of GDP that you would be spending on public service pensions – we're talking about pensions for public sector workers, as distinct from the state pension – then that would, on the policies at the time, be falling as a share of GDP rather than increasing. So, looked at in isolation, it's exerting less pressure on the public finances rather than more.</p><p>That said, it was part of a broader picture which showed there was an upward pressure on the public finances. So, if you want to deal with the upward pressure in aggregate, you can decide whether to cut the bits that are falling by even more, or whether to try to cut some of the bits that are rising by a bit. It depends on whether you are looking at it in isolation, or whether you are looking at it more widely.</p><p></p><p><strong>So whether it is sustainable depends on whether you are looking at the public spending cake as a whole, or the public sector pensions bit of it?</strong></p><p>Exactly. But that particular slice is not where the problem is coming from, let's put it that way. That's because of linking pensions to CPI inflation, and the fact that you've got fewer public sector workers, implying fewer people you need to pay pensions to in the future.</p><p></p><h2>Tax increases or spending cuts in the long term</h2><p></p><p><strong>You publish a fiscal sustainability report every year. In </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/FSR2011.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>the last one (pdf)</strong></a><strong>, you said the public finances were \"likely to come under pressure over the longer term\" and that \"in the absence of offsetting tax increases or spending cuts this would eventually put public sector net debt on an unsustainable upward trajectory\". What does that actually mean in practice?</strong></p><p>It's the idea that on unchanged policy the share of national income that you get in tax revenues does not really change very much as you go into the future. The fact that the population is ageing, and there are more people above working age than below working age, doesn't affect the total amount of tax revenue you get in very much, partly because older people are still buying things and they're paying VAT on them. However, if you then look on the spending side, that does rise as a share of GDP on unchanged policy, partly because, as the population ages, you need to spend more on things like the state pension, long-term care, health expenditure. That is where that pressure comes in.</p><p></p><p><strong>At the end of that report you quote some figures for what tax increases or spending cuts would be necessary as a result of these pressures, depending on what fiscal targets the government set. They're huge figures, £22bn, or £12bn. Do think policymakers have grasped the size of this challenge?</strong></p><p>The first thing I would say is that you need to place even more caveats around those sorts of numbers than you would do around shorter-term ones. The value of this sort of thing is painting a general picture of direction.</p><p></p><p><strong>But the government tries to save a few tens of millions by putting VAT on pasties, and the world goes berserk. And here you are talking about cuts of £22bn.</strong></p><p>But you are already seeing, not just this government but previous ones, talking about doing things about pension ages, for example. The debate about whether we ought to systematically link the pension age to life expectancy, that's a debate here.</p><p></p><p><strong>But do you think the public have woken up to the scale of spending cuts or tax rises that these numbers imply?</strong></p><p>It's hard to know with precision. There's been a lot of talk about the implications of an ageing population. I think people are aware of those sorts of pressures. The number of people who would give you a detailed discussion of exactly what per cent of GDP we're talking about I suspect is rather smaller. But I think it is something that people are thinking about and talking about.</p>","headline":"Robert Chote interview: 'I would not say in the past there's been rigging'","trailText":"The chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility talks about the potential impact of the eurozone crisis on Britain, the reliability of economic forecasts, and the future role of the OBR","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/18/1337344901573/Robert-Chote-004.jpg","wordcount":"4385","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"390330668","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6186597","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","internalPageCode":"1747456","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-05-21T14:59:05Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/18/robert-chote-interview-obr-economy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/may/18/robert-chote-interview-obr-economy","tags":[{"id":"business/office-for-budget-responsibility","webTitle":"Office for Budget Responsibility","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/economy","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrewsparrow","webTitle":"Andrew Sparrow","r2ContributorId":"20395","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/6/1399377991807/Andrew-Sparrow.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/6/1399378038371/Andrew-Sparrow-R.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Sparrow is the senior political correspondent on the Guardian website</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewsparrow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/andrewsparrow","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-390331021","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/18/1337344898915/Robert-Chote-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"David Sillitoe","altText":"Robert Chote","height":"54","credit":"David Sillitoe/Guardian","caption":"As chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote is the government’s independent forecaster-in-chief.

But some authorities are warning that rage is on the verge of tipping over into serious violence, and concerns are mounting over the knock-on effect on tourism, a vital source of income for southern Europe.</p><p>In Italy, military, police and intelligence officials are hammering out an emergency security plan for combating violent anarchy in the wake of a recent spate of violent attacks on individuals and institutions.</p><p>\"The risk of escalation exists,\" said interior minister Annamaria Cancellieri, adding that the government was prepared to send out the armed forces to protect sensitive targets if necessary.</p><p>The Equitalia tax offices in charge of collecting unpaid debts seems to be taking the brunt of public anger. Laid-off Fiat factory workers recently occupied a tax office in Sicily, and protests outside the Naples office turned violent. Several petrol bombs were thrown against a tax office in Tuscany last week.</p><p>Last week a small but violent group of Greek and Italian anarchists claimed responsibility for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/11/italian-anarchists-kneecap-nuclear-executive?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">kneecapping the head of Ansaldo Energia, a nuclear engineering firm owned by Finmeccanica</a>. Roberto Adinolfi was shot in the leg as he left home for work last Monday. Authors of the letter claiming responsibility said they were the Olga cell of the Federazione Anarchiste Informale (FAI). The group said it was named after Olga Ikonomidou, one of eight anarchists jailed in Greece. They said there would be seven more attacks to avenge the jailing of the other activists.</p><p>Government officials began heightening security at approximately 400 \"sensitive\" locations this week, with 24-hour surveillance initiated at Finmeccanica and Equitalia tax offices, as well as for several at risk individuals. Another 1,500 soldiers were detailed to maintaining public order, bringing the total to more than 4,000. As well as corporate offices, they will protect the contested high-speed train (TAV) line under construction between Turin and Lyons, according to Corriere della Sera.</p><p>In Spain, protests have largely been peaceful, with the exception of masked radicals in Barcelona who smashed windows and lit street fires during a general strike in March. But the conservative government is taking no chances, promising to tighten up laws on public protest. Street violence, it claims, will send the country's already dangerously high bond yields soaring.</p><p>Proposals for toughening up laws include making trades unions, associations and political parties pay for any vandalism by its members during protest marches.</p><p>\"I am deeply worried about the proposed changes to the law,\" said Cándido Méndez, head of the General Workers Union.</p><p>Sanctions for \"disobeying public authorities\" (meaning the police), are also set to be increased.</p><p>In Greece, bursts of anarchy and civil disobedience have sporadically infected the anti-austerity protest movement. Far from subsiding, it shows every sign of growing as Greeks prepare to head back to the polls in a climate of deepening political division and uncertainty.</p><p>\"We are at the end of our tether and, of course, are planning protests and strikes against policies that have done nothing but lead to poverty and wretchedness,\" said Nikos Kioutsoukis, general secretary at GSEE, the country's biggest labour force.</p><p>\"In the private sector, wages went down by 25.4% in 2011 alone. Overload a donkey, and as they say, its back will eventually give in.\"</p><p>Much, says Kioutsoukis, will depend on what government emerges next month. \"If they decide to continue with measures that are taking us to the bottom of the sea,\" he insists, \"the summer won't be hot it will be boiling.\"</p><p>It is a view shared in the cafes and student campuses around the capital. \"The time has come to show those wankers in the IMF and EU that we are not going to take any more lying down,\" said Takis Tasios, a computer programmer who said he had been out of work for the past year. \"I'm sick of being treated as a number by some technocrat who has no idea.\"</p><p>Authorities admit they are worried. Athens, once one of Europe's sleepiest capitals, now resembles a garrison town with riot police stationed on every corner. The police force is the only part of the public sector that is expanding. Greece, after all depends on tourism, and none more so than this year when unemployment has reached a record 21.7 %.</p><p>In a country with a thriving anarchist community and anti-establishment bloc, 'resistance' is a word that is never far away: it is scrawled in graffiti, large and small, over the facades of buildings nationwide.</p><p>\"The system is rotten and it has to be destroyed,\" the KKE communist party which has also vowed to step up opposition against keeping Greece in the EU proclaimed last week. \"The battle has to be unremitting.\"</p>","headline":"Southern Europe fears summer of

Instead of a rescue, the debt-stricken nation has been thrown into its worst recession since the second world war.</p><p>\"With this policy [bailout agreement] we are going directly to hell,\" he told CNN. \"To save Europe we need to change direction,\" insisted the politician who has pledged to \"tear up\" the €130bn (£104bn) \"memorandum of understanding\" that Athens reached with the EU and IMF earlier this year.</p><p>The 38-year-old, who has sent shockwaves through EU capitals with his fiery anti-austerity rhetoric, made the remarks as Syriza announced that he would be visiting Berlin and Paris next week for talks. It was unclear whom Tsipras would be meeting, although aides said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not be among those lined up.</p><p>Within hours, the leading credit agency Fitch had downgraded Greece's sovereign rating to CCC from B-, citing \"the risk of a Greek exit from European Monetary Union … in the near term\".</p><p>Earlier in the day, Antonis Samaras, who heads the conservative New Democracy party, painted a very different picture in a speech that conjured images of a living hell if Athens quit the EU.</p><p>In the event of the debt-stricken country reneging on the pledges it had made, the road ahead would be a \"nightmarish\" one, he said.</p><p>Reversion to the drachma would mean wages, deposits and property values all being \"cut in half\", and the price of imported commodities, such as food and fuel, skyrocketing, he predicted. \"This is the nightmare that those who speak of a unilateral condemnation [of the loan agreement] will bring,\" he told his parliamentary group at its last meeting before the 300-seat house is dissolved and the election campaign officially announced .</p><p>\"The battle that begins the day after tomorrow for the new elections is not about any single party or its electoral influence,\" said the 61-year-old politician, ashen-faced as he delivered the speech. \"It's about whether Greece will remain in Europe, a Europe which is itself changing. Or if Greece will be found to leave Europe, losing much and risking even more.\"</p><p>New Democracy, he said, would form the core of the \"front of resistance against catastrophe\".</p><p>After handing over to his successor, Panagiotis Pikramenos, a high court judge whose caretaker government will lead Greece to elections on 17 June, the outgoing prime minister, Lucas Papademos, also stepped into the fray.</p><p>The former central banker, who headed an emergency left-right \"salvation government\" that secured the EU-IMF sponsored deal, said he feared that sacrifices Greeks had made in the form of tax increases and pay and pension cuts would be lost if voters decided to back anti-austerity parties at the ballot box next month.</p><p>Greeks had endured the punitive cutbacks to put the economy back on track through fiscal consolidation, he said.</p><p>\"The Greek people's sacrifices were not an 'empty shirt',\" said Papademos in an open letter to the nation, his last act before leaving office.</p><p>\"Unilaterally renouncing the country's loan agreement would be disastrous for Greece, as it would inevitably lead the country out of the euro, and possibly out of the European Union,\" he wrote. \"There are those who are waiting to benefit from the chaos that will follow the humbling exit of the country from the common currency.\"</p><p>Next month's poll follows an inconclusive election on 6 May which ushered in the rise of \"anti-bailout\" groups such as Syriza – the vote's surprise runner-up – and decimated \"pro-bailout\" parties such as New Democracy and the socialist Pasok.</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian, senior Syriza officials insisted that the party, which polls suggest is poised to emerge as the biggest political force, had \"no intention\" of unilaterally revoking the accord.</p><p>\"Austerity is over in this country and it's the end of the memorandum of understanding,\" said Takis Pavlopoulos, one of Tsipras's top aides, referring to the accord. \"You have to be a neo-liberal fanatic not to see that it [austerity] has failed,\" he added, pointing out the record levels of unemployment and deepening poverty engulfing Greece. \"But we will not proceed with any unilateral action that might question Greece's membership of the eurozone.\"</p><p>Greece, he said, had been among the original member states to sign up to the then EEC. As such, Athens was also a \"co-owner\" of the project and could not be ejected from a union it had participated in for over 30 years.</p><p>\"Destructive austerity was not part of the deal for any member state to enter the eurozone. No one has the right to say 'either you accept austerity or leave',\" added the US-trained economist.</p><p>Policymakers have claimed that renouncing the loan agreement will lead not only to a disorderly default – with ensuing chaos taking hold of a country whose economy is already on its knees – but possibly to the breakup of the 17-nation bloc.</p><p>Syriza argues that such claims are a high-stakes bluff aimed at safeguarding the status quo. Euro–exit fears were not reverberating around the corridors of the European parliament, insisted Nikolaos Chountis, the party's sole Euro-MP.</p><p>\"There are other voices that you hear that are very ambivalent about the policies being pursued in the name of resolving this crisis,\" the MEP said. \"And there are other countries that are in a very difficult position like Portugal and Ireland. All this scaremongering that is peddled here about Greece facing a living hell just doesn't exist in Brussels.\"</p><p>Fears that Greece would not have enough money to even pay public sector pay and pensions in the event of loans drying up were simply not true, said Panaghiotis Lafazanis, another Syriza MP. \"The loans basically cover interest payments,\" he said.</p><p>\"They [the Europeans] can't kick us out. The memorandum is not part of the eurozone institutional framework. It is a political choice that has been deligitimised by popular vote.\"</p>","headline":"Austerity will send Greece to hell, warns Alexis Tsipras","trailText":"Syriza leader's claims countered by

Moody's admitted it was unlikely that the UK Financial Services Authority would allow Santander UK to substantially weaken itself in order to support the parent. increasing instability.</p><p>Earlier Moody's had also downgraded four regions in Spain.</p><p>The moves from the credit rating agency came after a day of fears that Spain will be the next domino to fall if Greece leaves the euro, as the country was forced to deny that there was a run on its fourth-biggest lender, Bankia.</p><p>Bankia shares fell almost 30% at one point after reports – later refuted – that depositors were withdrawing their funds. It was bailed out only last week when the government converted loans into a 45% stake.</p><p>The European commission warned last week that high debts in the regions, which account for half of public spending, could prevent Spain meeting its deficit goal of 5.3% of GDP this year.</p><p>\"It is not true that at this time a flight of deposits from Bankia is taking place,\" said Fernando Jiménez Latorre, the deputy economy minister. El Mundo newspaper reported that clients had withdrawn €1bn (£800m) of deposits from the bank since last week's bailout.</p><p>This appears to have sparked jitters among investors and some clients, though there was no sign of panic in branches. \"If they take my money away, I'll kill,\" one Bankia client spat at budget minister Cristóbal Montoro after approaching him on the street, according to El Mundo.</p><p>The bank itself reassured clients in a statement sent to Spain's stock market supervisor. The new chairman, José Ignacío Goirigolzarri, said: \"Bankia's clients can be absolutely calm about the security of the savings they have deposited.\"</p><p>Bankia said operations at its branches had \"been within normal parameters\" during a fortnight of what it called \"a highly seasonal nature\". It also predicted that \"the level of deposits will not suffer any major changes over the coming days\".</p><p>That was little consolation to 400,000 Spanish investors who were last year persuaded to buy shares in the new bank, which was created by the amalgamation of seven savings banks. The shares have lost 70% of their value since the flotation in the summer.</p><p>\"It was a shotgun marriage,\" the head of Madrid's regional government, Esperanza Aguirre, complained, blaming the central bank. The new shareholders have seen their investments slide for 10 straight days and some analysts saw the sell-off as an attempt to cut losses rather than a reaction to rumours of a run on the bank.</p><p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy continues to insist that Spain must pursue austerity; on Wednesday, he called on Europe to take measures, too, warning that Spain risked being frozen out of capital markets as its bond yields crept ever higher, raising the interest rates it must pay on debt.</p><p>Spain's borrowing costs shot up further on Thursday with the country's treasury paying about 5% to attract buyers of three- and four-year bonds.</p><p>The government took over Bankia, which holds 10% of Spanish deposits, in an attempt to dispel concerns over toxic real estate assets left over from a 2008 property crash.</p><p>Spain's economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter, putting it back into recession and with a long downturn in prospect as the government cuts spending in an attempt to wrestle down its budget deficit. Unemployment is already nearing 25%, with half of the young without a job.</p><p>Anxiety about the eurozone spread to other banks, with shares in Barclays and the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group all down more than 3% on anxiety about their exposure to the single currency.</p><p>UK banks have cut their exposure to Greece to under £6bn. Shares in the French bank BNP were down 4.1%, while Italy's Banca Popolare di Milano and Spain's Bankinter also fell more than 4%.</p><p>• This article was amended on Friday 18 May 2012 to make clear that Santander UK has been downgraded to a notch above its Spanish parent company.</p>","headline":"Moody's downgrades Santander UK along with 16 Spanish banks","trailText":"<p>Shares in Bankia, Spain's fourth largest lender, also tumble as rumours spread of depositors withdrawing funds</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"15","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/18/1337297528422/moodys-downgrades-santand-003.jpg","wordcount":"713","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"390301259","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6191932","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Tremlett in Madrid","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-05-18T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1747185","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-05-20T19:55:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/17/spain-denies-bankia-customers-rushing-to-withdraw","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/17/spain-denies-bankia-customers-rushing-to-withdraw","tags":[{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","references":[]},{"id":"business/rating-agencies","webTitle":"Rating agencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rating-agencies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/rating-agencies","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/debt-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/emu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/emu","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking","references":[]},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europeanbanks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/europeanbanks","references":[]},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-crisis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/financial-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/euro","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/euro","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilestremlett","webTitle":"Giles Tremlett","rcsId":"GNL455063","r2ContributorId":"15670","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/giles_tremlett_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Tremlett is a contributing editor to the Guardian and Madrid correspondent for the Economist.

There is an ongoing slow-motion collapse in annuity rates, and this week it got a little worse. When a man aged 65 swaps £100,000 in his pension pot for an annuity – a regular monthly income for the rest of his life – the sum will be just £6,000 a year. That compares with the £14,000 a year that someone retiring in 1990 earned from a savings pot of £100,000. If the pensioners wants to build in 3% a year cost-of-living increases into the annuity, the rate he'll get for that £100,000 will be a paltry £4,150 a year.</p><p>But why blame Greece? Because the surprise status of the UK as a \"safe haven\" for international money during the crisis has pushed the interest rate on government bonds (known as gilts) to historic lows – and the price of gilts has a strong influence on the price of annuities.</p><p>This week the return on 10-year bond yields, which reflect the cost of borrowing by the government, fell to 1.87% as investors fearful of the enveloping euro crisis reduced their lending to Spain and Italy in favour of the UK, Germany, the US and Japan. The fall in gilt yields this week beat the previous low of 1.92% in January, and is the lowest level since Bank of England records started in 1703.</p><p>This week Canada Life cut annuity rates, and others are expected to follow, says Billy Burrows of Better Retirement Group. \"It's another nail in the coffin for UK savers. The retired have been paying the price for the banking crisis through lower savings rates, now people reaching retirement are paying the price for Greece.\"</p><p>What's more, the outlook for men is much worse for women – because on 22 December an EU directive will force pension companies to equalise annuity rates between males and females. Men, who suffer shorter longevity than women, receive better annuities as a result, but after 22 December these will be cut, while those for women will be increased.</p><p>The options for those approaching retirement are grim; work for longer and defer retirement (and if you get ill in the meantime, there's the silver lining of better rates as the insurer assumes you'll die earlier) or buy a temporary annuity. These can be bought for a fixed period, usually with a minimum of five years and a maximum of the period until age 75 is reached. But as Gemma Goodman of annuity brokers Alexander Forbes says, there is no guarantee it'll be better value; at age 75 annuity rates may be even lower.</p><p>A PricewaterhouseCoopers report this week suggested that babies born today may have to work until 77 before they qualify for a state pension. Given the ever-shrinking value of annuities, it may be worth younger adults considering alternative ways of saving other than a pension – such as Isas or property – where you do not have to buy an annuity at retirement.</p><h2>2 Your investments</h2><p>The stock market continues to fall heavily in response to the Greek crisis, with speculators assuming a disorderly default, and its hit on the banks could lop as much as 5% off the GDP of Europe. The FTSE has lost 1,090 of its value since it hit a high of 5,965 as recently as 16 March, wiping £190bn off the value of the UK's biggest companies, much of it still held in pension funds.</p><p>Investors who have stock market-based Isas invested in Europe have fared a lot worse. Over the past year some giant funds have lost as much as a quarter of their investors' money. Invesco Perpetual European Equity, a £1bn fund, is down 26%, while the £200m Artemis European Growth fund is down 25.8%. Even over five years the average fund invested in Europe has managed to lose 16.5%, with some down as much as 40%.</p><p>There have been few safe havens from the Greek crisis. Gilts have had, once again, a good crisis. The average UK gilts fund is up 4.8% over the past three months, and investors who have held for the past five years are enjoying gains of 58%. Most corporate bond funds have also held their heads above water, but almost everything else has been in negative territory. Interestingly, China has been worst, performing even more poorly than mainland Europe. Analysts say that when investors become risk-averse money pours back into safer territories, leaving emerging markets exposed.</p><p>But gold has been the odd man out during the latest phase of the Greek tragedy. Its price this week dropped to about $1,530 an ounce, its lowest level for nearly nine months, and 20% below its $1,895 high in early September 2011. Investors have preferred the safety of US dollars and US treasury bonds to the traditional safe harbour of gold. Some people also argue that in times of extreme economic stress investors sell gold to get their hands on cash.</p><p>The good news is that virtually all commodities have fallen back in price in recent months, although that has as much to do with softening of the Chinese economy as problems in Europe. Since September wheat is down from $8 a bushel to $6, coffee is down from $2.80 to $1.77 a pound, and sugar has fallen from $850 a tonne to $570. Whether we'll see these falls reflected at Sainsbury's or Tesco is another matter. Meanwhile, copper thefts from Britain's railways should become less attractive; the metal is down in price from $9,600 a tonne last July to $7,700 this week.</p><h2>3 Your savings and mortgage<br /></h2><p>Relief for savers suffering from paltry returns on their building society accounts remains as far away as ever. The latest fall in gilt yields brought by the Greek crisis will help keep interest rates in Britain low for longer than anyone imagined back in 2009 when Bank of England base rate fell to an historic low of 0.5%.</p><p>Savers who want a better return on their cash may have to start considering riskier alternatives – such as \"retail bonds\" from the likes of Tesco, which, although not offering any guarantees under the government's compensation scheme, pay interest of 5%-8% a year.</p><p>There's better news for mortgage holders, though – except those on pricey long-term fixes. Last week the latest meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold once again, and economists are virtually united in forecasting near-zero rates through to 2014. \"Interest rates seem set to remain at their current level of 0.5% until at least late 2013 and very possibly into 2014. Interest rates are clearly not going to be raised for some considerable time to come given the fragility of the economy and the need to counter extended tight fiscal policy,\" said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight.</p><p>The outlook suggests that those on existing tracker mortgages or low-standard variable rates – such as Nationwide's 2.5% base mortgage rate – should cling on for as long as possible. For new buyers the best tracker rates are on offer from First Direct, which has a mortgage that tracks the Bank's base rate plus 2.39% for life, giving a rate of 2.89% for now. However, it is only available to those able to put down a deposit of at least 35%, and comes with an arrangement fee of £499. If you can only afford a 15% deposit HSBC's tracker at 3.99% is top of the table. It has no arrangement fees.</p><h2>4 Your car</h2><p>The problems in Greece are at least providing some relief to motorists, with fears of slowing global economic growth pushing the oil price down substantially over the past six weeks. In mid-March Brent crude was selling for $125 a barrel, but this week it fell to a six-month low of $108 amid renewed concerns that a breakup of the euro would send economic shockwaves around the world.</p><p>The fall has sparked a price war at the supermarket petrol pumps, with Asda cutting its prices four times over the past four weeks. On Tuesday this week Morrisons cut its price to 132.9p for unleaded and 137.9p for diesel. Then on Wednesday Asda undercut Morrisons, offering unleaded for 0.2p less at 132.7p. The price reductions mean the cost of unleaded is now 8p below its March peak.</p><p>Asda said it \"always aims to lead the way when we get the chance to cut prices because of a drop in the global cost of oil,\" and took a swipe at rival supermarkets, which vary their petrol prices around the country. \"Unlike other retailers we do everything we can to reduce prices for all of our customers wherever they live. Research taken from <a href=\"http://www.petrolprices.com\" title=\"\">PetrolPrices.com</a> shows some retailers get away with charging their customers more for fuel – as much as 8p a litre more – in towns without an Asda nearby.\"</p><p>According to PetrolPrices.com the average price for a litre of unleaded in the UK is 138.1p, but some petrol forecourts are charging as much as 155p a litre.</p><p>However, prices will nudge back up again in August with the 3p rise in duty announced in the budget.</p><h2>5 Your holiday</h2><p>Most holidaymakers heading to France, Spain or Italy will benefit from the euro's slide against sterling, falling to €1.25 this week and with some currency experts forecasting further declines to €1.30. But what if you are heading for a fortnight on a sunny beach on a Greek island, only to find that the country has crashed out of the eurozone? Will your holiday be at risk? Bob Atkinson of travelsupermarket.com says: \"The issue will be around how your tour operator interacts with the hoteliers in Greece, and what the terms of their contracts say. They should all have plans in place that will allow you to continue with your holiday.</p><p>But what if the hotelier has gone bust? \"If you have booked an Atol-covered package your tour operator is obliged to organise alternative accommodation, or if there is no immediate alternative, a holiday on a different date or a full refund.</p><p>\"If you have booked independently, you may still be covered provided you paid by credit card and the deposit was £100 or more, you paid by Visa or MasterCard debit card (and can do a charge-back), or have travel insurance which includes end-supplier failure in its cover,\" says Atkinson.</p><p>He recommends that Greek-bound travellers hold off buying euros until the last minute. \"Unless the whole banking system goes into meltdown you are also likely to be able to use credit and debit cards, although it's impossible to say which currency your transactions will be made in until it actually happens.\"</p><p>Brits with holiday homes in Greece, and an account at a local bank, would be wise to swap their euros for sterling. That probably also applies to ex-pats in Cyprus, which is independent of Greece but whose banking system is closely entwined with the country.</p><p>In the worst case (and still highly unlikely) scenario – contagion from a Greek collapse across to other Mediterranean countries such as Spain and Portugal – British retirees abroad will want to make sure they have very little of their assets deposited in local banks.</p>","headline":"The eurozone crisis: five ways it affects you","trailText":"<p>From pensions and savings to holidays, we look at how the latest market turmoil will impact on

The country's income per person of $9,000 ranks it 88th in the world, as compared to the eurozone countries, which are three or four times richer. But they face a common problem, and although none of the eurozone countries is likely to become as poor as Jamaica is today, they could easily – going forward – mimic the dismal economic performance that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/15/developing-world-of-debt\">Jamaica has seen over the past 20 years</a>.</p><p>Jamaica has the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-05/D9ULE0A01.htm\">world's highest public debt burden</a>: interest payments on the government's debt account for 10% of the country's national income. (For comparison, Greece – with the worst debt burden in Europe – is paying 6.8% of GDP in interest.) This leaves little room for public investment in infrastructure, or improving education or healthcare. Partly as a result of this debt trap, Jamaica's income per person has grown <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/update-on-the-jamaican-economy\">by just 0.7% annually over the past 20 years.</a></p><p>Two years ago, Jamaica reached an agreement with its creditors, brokered by the IMF, that restructured its debt. Interest payments were lowered, and some principal payments were pushed forward. But the debt burden remained unsustainable. The IMF now projects that Jamaica's debt will reach 153% of GDP in just three years.</p><p>Sound familiar? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/feb/06/european-central-bank-greek-debt\">That is what happened to Greece</a> just four months ago. The Greek government reached an agreement with the European authorities (the \"Troika\" of the European Central Bank or ECB, the European Commission, and the IMF) that reduced its debt. Unlike in Jamaica, the private investors holding Greek debt took a \"haircut\", losing about half of the principal.</p><p>But still, it wasn't enough. Before the ink was dry on the deal, an IMF estimate of a \"pessimistic scenario\" going forward showed Greek debt reaching more than 160% of GDP by 2020. Since the IMF's projections for Greece over the past few years have proved enormously over-optimistic, and with Europe sliding further into recession, the pessimistic scenario is the more likely one. This means that even if Greek voters end up with a government that accepts the agreement – by no means guaranteed – it is likely that their economy will limp along from one crisis to the next until there is another restructuring, or a chaotic default.</p><p>In both Greece and Jamaica, the problem is not just the debt itself; even more, it is the policies that the creditors have attached to further lending. <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/more-pain-no-gain-for-greece\">In Greece, this is extreme</a>: the Troika insisted on Greece cutting 8.6% of GDP from its fiscal deficit over the past two years – the equivalent of the United States wiping out its entire federal budget deficit of $1.3tn. Naturally, the economy went into a tailspin. In Jamaica also, the IMF attached conditions during the 2008-2009 economic crisis that worsened the country's downturn.</p><p>Europe's problem with harmful policies attached to official lending is not limited to Greece. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120511-705968.html\">Dow Jones' recent headline tells the sad story of  Portugal</a> in a sentence: \"EU: Portugal Will Need More Austerity To Meet Deficit Targets.\" Yes, the European Commission wants Portugal to make even bigger budget cuts because the ones they already made have shrunk the economy so much that they won't make their target deficit-to-GDP ratio. The economy is projected to shrink by a painful 3.3% this year, and official unemployment has risen from 12.9% last year, to 15.3% this. Ireland is in recession, yet it, too, is engaging in big budget tightening.</p><p>Spain hasn't yet had to borrow from the Troika, but has followed the same policies. With more than half of its youth languishing in unemployment, Spain's fiscal tightening – according to the government's projections – will carve 2.6% out of its economic growth this year.</p><p>Of course, there are many important differences between the situation of the eurozone countries and Jamaica, and among the eurozone countries themselves. Jamaica needs debt cancellation; some of the eurozone countries in trouble – for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/03/spain-debts-high-government-bonds\">Spain</a> – would have a sustainable debt burden if the ECB would simply intervene in the sovereign bond markets and guarantee a low interest rate on their bonds. And the ECB, as the issuer of a hard currency in a monetary area with no serious inflationary threat, has a lot of room to do whatever is necessary to make sure that all of the eurozone countries have low borrowing costs and therefore sustainable debt.</p><p>But the ECB has refused to use its powers to put an end to the sovereign debt crisis, preferring instead – hand-in-hand with the rest of the Troika – to exploit it in order to force unpopular political changes in eurozone countries, especially the weaker ones. In so doing, they are condemning these countries to the long-term stagnation of high unemployment and slow growth that Jamaica has suffered for the past two decades. Although the human costs are much higher in a developing country such as Jamaica, this still entails a huge amount of unnecessary suffering on both sides of the ocean.</p>","headline":"The Jamaicanisation of the eurozone","trailText":"<p><strong>Mark Weisbrot:</strong> By imposing budget cuts and austerity, the ECB is condemning countries like Greece and Spain to an economic twilight zone</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/20/1316531328810/Street-in-Kingston-Jamaic-003.jpg","wordcount":"827","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"390366402","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Weisbrot","internalPageCode":"1747792","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-05-21T21:34:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/18/jamaicanisation-eurozone","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/18/jamaicanisation-eurozone","tags":[{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/debt-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markweisbrot","webTitle":"Mark Weisbrot","r2ContributorId":"22884","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389979883830/Mark-Weisbrot_new.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/mark-weisbrot/\">Mark Weisbrot</a> is co-director of the <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/\">Centre for Economic and Policy Research</a> in Washington DC.

Healthy banks in a sick economy: a bad mix. Yet this new emphasis on growth is hardly a consensus.</p><p>Economists, since the time of Adam Smith's 1776 work, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations\" title=\"\">Wealth of Nations</a>, have debated what causes growth. Indeed, some economists have long insisted that growth occurs precisely through thrift – that is, austerity. And in recent weeks we have heard many economists argue that growth in the eurozone will come from \"structural reforms\" that will make it easier to collect taxes, reduce red tape, and easier to hire and fire workers.</p><p>But growth requires investment. Companies invest to make profits and grow. Evidence shows those which invest more in new technology, human capital and research and development, and are located in countries where public spending in these areas is high, are able to produce more competitive and better value products.</p><p>Italy has not grown for the last 10 years, mainly because its public and private sector did not make key investments in factors that increase productivity. Its debt-to-GDP ratio rose because its growth rate was so much lower than the interest it paid on its debt. And Greece grew in the 90s not because it was making smart investments but because badly directed European structural funds allowed it to get away with not making them. Once those funds expired, so did the false growth.</p><p>And structural reforms without investment don't produce growth. When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecom_Italia\" title=\"\">Telecom Italia</a> was privatised in 1997 (to spur growth) it cut its research and development spending, and is now much less innovative and competitive than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com\" title=\"\">France Télécom</a>, which remained partly public and continued to invest. Scandinavia, with its large welfare state and stringent labour laws, has been one of the most crisis-resilient regions because it invests in innovation.</p><p>Yet through its moralistic and deflationary stance of \"do what the Germans did\", pressure from Germany is not allowing the weaker eurozone countries to do just that. German competitiveness is not due only to its lower unit labour costs (which are not low when welfare benefits are included), but to its strategic investments in research and development, vocational training, state investment banks that create \"patient\" finance, and its recent emphasis on greening the economy. Similarly, the engineering group Siemens did not win a UK contract for fast green trains because of low wages, but because of its innovation investments, which have made it one of the most competitive companies in the world.</p><p>The eurozone will grow only once weaker countries are allowed to make the strategic investments Germany has. There is much talk about the need for internal rebalancing, to increase the competitiveness of the deficit-burdened south relative to the surplus-blessed north, but this is a limited view. What is required is not that wages fall in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, but that they make investments that increase their productivity – an impossibility with austerity-driven policies.</p><p>And the lack of these investments only makes Germany more competitive relative to its southern neighbours – but without a strong EU, Germany will not be able to compete with China and Brazil in emerging sectors and technologies.</p><p>A critical player, the <a href=\"http://www.eib.org/\" title=\"\">European Investment Bank</a>, could encourage productive investments across Europe, generating a real rebalancing. The EIB could become the financial arm of what should be, but is not, Europe's equivalent of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009\" title=\"\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>. Applying the principle of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_%28economics%29\" title=\"\">Keynesian multiplier</a>\", the current proposal is to increase its capital by a modest €10bn, unleashing €60bn in co-financing projects which will then (hopefully) multiply to as much as €180bn of European Union output.</p><p>But to render this a systematic mechanism for European economic solidarity, more is needed. Under the present law, EIB investments need to be co-financed by member states; and the weaker ones have no cash for this. Only if European Central Bank bonds can co-finance EIB bonds – which Germany resists – will EIB investments allow Greece, for instance, to grow through investment in renewables, putting its sunshine to better use than just tourism. And, in the process, create the desperately needed dynamic \"spillovers\" in technology, research, education, and training.</p><p>So if growth is really on the agenda, the focus should be on the productive investments needed to rebalance Europe, and mechanisms that allow that to happen. It is far too easy for David Cameron to say \"get your house in order\" and then work against such mechanisms. The eurozone will rise when new economic thinking wins over static ideology.</p>","headline":"If the eurozone is serious about growth, it can have it","trailText":"<p><strong>Mariana

The new election is seen as a referendum on the euro. If the anti-austerity Syriza party wins control and cannot force Germany to relax its opposition to lower and slower cuts, there may be no option but for Greece to leave the eurozone – or be kicked out.</p><p><strong>So it's down to democracy then?</strong></p><p>Not quite. If outflows from the Greek banks continue at this current pace then the instability could force Greece out of the eurozone before the election.</p><p><strong>What would happen if Greece left? </strong></p><p>It would have to be carried out almost overnight – most likely over a weekend. The banks would have to shut their doors, bank accounts would be frozen and capital controls imposed to stop any more money leaving the country. The new currency would be likely to lose at least 50% of its value relative to the euro so any saver in Greece who has left their money in a bank will instantly find it is worth considerably less. Opinion polls show that while Greeks do not want austerity, most of them want to stay in the euro – which explains why savings are still sitting in Greek banks.</p><p><strong>What will the new drachma look like?</strong></p><p>Unless a load of forgotten drachma are found in a vault, Greece will need to print a new currency. It is possible that the authorities have thought ahead as Slovakia did when it split from Czechoslovakia in 1993, printing a new currency and hiding it away in London until it was needed. A more likely option could involve tweaking euros already in circulation in Greece. Some suggest a D could be emblazoned across euros, while others suggest corners could be clipped off. It would also need a new symbol for currency traders on the money markets. Before the euro, the drachma was known as GRD and by the numeric symbol 300 for international trading. The financial markets – and their computers – would need a new symbol for the currency quickly so that it could be traded.</p><p><strong>Would it only have an impact in Greece?</strong></p><p>The key question and hardest to answer.

The bank, however, said this was only a \"modest increase\" - less than 0.2% of its retail deposits and tiny compared with the bank's liquidity buffer of £35bn.</p><h2>Should I be worried about Santander?</h2><p>The bank is keen to underline just how much it is ring-fenced from its Spanish operations. Santander's UK operation is wholly-owned by, but autonomous from, Banco Santander. It is authorised and regulated by the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA) and a spokesman says it has its own balance sheet, separate from its parent company.</p><p>He also says 90% of the UK bank's balance sheet is UK-related money. \"Sovereign exposures to Europe [excluding the UK] at 31 March 2012 were not significant, at less than 1% of total assets, and primarily related to Swiss government securities,\" he says. \"Total exposure to eurozone periphery countries was less than 0.3% of total assets.\"</p><p>If the parent company wanted to extract money from the UK bank it would have to sell it or pay itself a dividend, but that would only be approved by the FSA if it met strict UK capital requirements. In short, this means if the Spanish part of the bank was in trouble it could not prop itself up with money extracted from the UK bank.</p><p>The spokesman says: \"Both Santander and Santander UK are strong businesses focused on retail banking with no exposure to toxic financial products. Santander's UK business is strong and has a standalone credit rating which is one of the highest credit ratings of any UK bank.\"</p><p>Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers John Charcol says Santander is \"probably the safest bank in the UK\" because nearly all its savings and lending is in the UK. \"If it gets very messy in Europe the knock-on effect is likely to hit other banks such as Barclays and Lloyds more than it would hit Santander,\" Boulger adds.</p><h2>So are my savings safe?</h2><p>UK consumers with money in Santander are protected by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/10/claiming-compensation\" title=\"Factsheet: The Financial Services Compensation Scheme\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a>. This covers deposits of up to £85,000 held in the bank, or £170,000 for couples, and includes money previously held in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/interactive/2010/sep/02/savings-providers\" title=\"How safe are your savings?\">Alliance &amp; Leicester or Abbey accounts</a>. If the worst did happen you would get that much money back, although it could take up to six months for your claim to be processed. The standard consumer advice is not to hold more than £85,000 in the account of any UK bank, Santander included.</p><h2>What if I have my mortgage with them?</h2><p>There's bad news for anyone secretly hoping something will go wrong so they can escape repaying their mortgage or other debts: if a bank or building society fails you will still be liable to pay off your debt. David Hollingworth of mortgage broker London &amp; Country says: \"When banks have got into difficulty before, the bank has either been sold on or the mortgage book has been sold … your liability remains the same and the terms and conditions on your mortgage would continue to be the same.\"</p><h2>Will I still be able to get a mortgage from Santander?</h2><p>It's going to get tougher than it already is. Mortgage brokers report that in recent months Santander, which along with HSBC has been one of the few \"volume\" lenders during the financial crisis, has begun withdrawing from the market.</p><p>Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients, says: \"Santander has pulled back significantly in terms of lending volumes this year. It is demonstrating much less of an appetite to lend, which is having a knock-on effect on other lenders and their service levels, because in recent years Santander has done significant volumes of lending. Other lenders are having to pick up the slack, and more applicants inevitably mean longer processing times.\"</p><p>Ben Thompson of L&amp;G Mortgage Club, which sources nearly one in 10 mortgages in the UK, says: \"The fact Santander has been lending less to the market since the beginning of the year has meant that much of this demand has now permeated to some of the other lenders. Consequently, many of those lenders have been faced with increased demand that they are struggling to meet.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/17/spain-denies-bankia-customers-rushing-to-withdraw\" title=\"Moody's downgrades Santander UK along with 16 Spanish banks\">cut in Santander's credit rating</a> is likely to increase the cost of the bank's funding, making it more difficult to offer best-buy mortgages. The bank has already slashed its interest-only offering, demanding borrowers put down at least a 50% deposit. If the crisis deepens all banks, not just Santander, are likely to tighten already tight lending criteria.</p><h2>Is this a great time to buy shares in Santander?</h2><p>The bank's shares, quoted on the Madrid stock exchange, are still held by hundreds of thousands of UK small investors from the days when Abbey demutualised, only to be bought later by Santander.</p><p>In March 2009 after the collapse of Lehman they plummeted to just €4.14, then within eight months bounced back to €11.96. This week they were back at 2009 levels, hitting €4.37, but today are trading slightly up at €4.59. According to stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown banks were the most heavily traded shares among small investors this week, although he noted they have turned from net buyers to sellers.</p><p>Big investors warn that now is not the time to jump in. Tom Dobell, who runs the £8bn M&amp;G Recovery fund which specialises in buying shares of distressed companies it thinks will bounce back, is hugely negative on the banks. \"[They] have been run for the benefit of themselves, not shareholders. The only one I'd cross the road for is HSBC. The others can wait outside the back door,\" he says.</p>","headline":"Santander Q&amp;A: is your money safe?","trailText":"<p>With the eurozone turmoil spreading to banks in Spain, we look at what

This is the message now being sent to Greece by Europe's key leaders in the space between the election earthquake of 6 May and the ballot rerun on 17 June.</p><p>For the first time in 30 months of crisis, Europe's leaders have been talking publicly of a country being forced to quit the euro. There is no doubt a \"Grexit\" will do immense damage to Greece and to Europe.</p><p>It's a question of scale – containment or contagion.</p><p>No one really knows whether a Greek departure will result in an exponentially bigger Spanish and Italian crisis that could kill the currency and perhaps mortally wound the EU, or whether the fallout will be restricted to Greek calamity and collateral damage to European banks that can be lived with.</p><p>The fact that leaders such as José Manuel Barroso, Olli Rehn, Angela Merkel, and Wolfgang Schäuble are publicly discussing the eventuality of a Greek exit suggests strongly they think the damage can be limited, that they've used the past two years to quarantine Greece.</p><p>They may be right. But it's a gamble. It would not be the first time in 30 months they have miscalculated.</p><p>EU leaders also mean it when they say they'd prefer to keep Greece in the euro. To that end, they are now effectively telling the Greeks how to vote on 17 June – for the two big discredited parties, New Democracy and the socialist Pasok, whose combined vote collapsed from 79% to 32% 12 days ago.</p><p>These may be extraordinary times. But it would be more than extraordinary to see such an electoral shift within six weeks. All the signs so far are that the young firebrand bailout rejectionist, Alexis Tsipras, – the main beneficiary of the stalemate in Athens – is likely to improve his performance in the election rerun. He is said to be heading to Berlin and Paris next week for talks on the next moves.</p><p>If Greece is to stay in the euro, something has to give – on Tsipras's rejection of the \"memorandum\" (what Greece has to do to receive the bailout) and/or on Berlin's rules-bound approach that brooks no wavering nor flexibility in administering the medicine.</p><p>Despite the impression of strictness, Merkel has shifted several times in the crisis, always at the very last minute and arguably too late, reactively rather than pre-emptively. She hinted at another shift on Wednesday.</p><p>\"If Greece believes that we can find more stimulus in Europe in addition to the memorandum, then we have to talk about that,\" she said.</p><p>Relaxing the timetable of Greece's deficit reduction and budget cuts, for example, could help, allowing the economy to breathe a little rather than being strangled in the depths of recession.</p><p>The same could be said about Spain, or even the Netherlands, a healthy economy that nonetheless is grappling with a deficit dilemma, which would be much more easily repaired over three to four years than one to two.</p><p>The rightwing Spanish government sounds committed to slashing spending, tearing up Spain's social contract and making the structural changes it needs to meet the eurozone budget deficit targets.</p><p>But it can't do anything about Greece. It fears being next in line of fire for the financial markets. It is angry that Berlin and Paris are failing to fix the euro, leaving Madrid highly vulnerable to events outside its immediate control.</p><p>Greater flexibility and longer timelines for debt reduction would allow the new star of Greek politics to argue that he won his \"renegotiation\" of the terms of Greece's rescue. The Germans would still stress that austerity remains sacrosanct. The new French regime would declare that it is already making a difference, that its emphasis on growth strategies is already paying dividends.</p><p>The time and the place to agree this is next Wednesday at a special EU summit in Brussels.</p>","headline":"If Greece is to stay in the euro, something's got to give","trailText":"While EU leaders now talk publicly of Greece leaving the euro, a
