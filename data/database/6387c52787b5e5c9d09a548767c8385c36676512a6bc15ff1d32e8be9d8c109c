This would have been a great loss because Bettany (who acted Russell Crowe off the screen in both <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and <em>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</em>) remains one of the UK's most charismatic and reliably watchable screen exports, a Malcolm McDowell for the 21st century. Thankfully the actor's faith in the medium was restored by a script that would go on to garner an unexpected but thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination for writer/director JC Chandor, forming the backbone of a film that would prove conclusively that Bettany still had within him the fire so spectacularly evidenced in films such as <em>Gangster No 1</em> and <em>Dogville</em>.</p><p>In the ensemble drama <strong>Margin Call</strong> (2011, Paramount, 15) Bettany plays a smoothly reptilian corporate bagman working in a pre-crash American financial firm in 2008. Having fired the risk analyst (Stanley Tucci) who stumbled on a potentially catastrophic \"over-exposure\", the firm faces a Lehman-like long, dark night of the soulin which the abyss looms as black as the sky above the glittering skyscrapers of New York. As the quizzically eyebrowed Zachary Quinto (one of several credited producers) struggles to understand the numbers, the crisis escalates upwards, through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/kevinspacey\" title=\"\">Kevin Spacey</a>'s bullish boss to Jeremy Irons's peculiarly detached company overlord, who has the manner of a descended demi-god and demands to be spoken to \"as you might to a young child, or a golden retriever\".</p><p>With echoes of the fiscal morality of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a> and (more pertinently) the pressure-cooker grind of <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, it's easy to see why this tense, intelligent economic-thriller should have attracted such a starry cast (even Demi Moore makes a cameo). It's a little stagey at times but for the most part debut director Chandor injects real dramatic zing into the proceedings, surrounding his cast with alienating shiny surfaces that reflect the emptiness of their lives and the terror on their faces as Armageddon approaches. At its best, this has something of the madness of Po Bronson's scorchingly prophetic novel <em>Bombardiers</em>, with its only semi-satirical visions of traders hiding in crawlspaces beneath their desks serving as a perfect metaphor for offices as warzones. And in the midst of it all, Bettany gets to deliver the very best Gekko-esque speech about how \"normal people\" have nothing but their own unrealistic greed to blame for the coming storm, and how without him \"the world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly, and nobody actually wants that\". Largely overlooked in cinemas, this movie actually gains dramatic collateral on the small screen, where it proves a solidly smart investment.</p><p>Although JC Chandor and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/davidcronenberg\" title=\"\">David Cronenberg</a> are worlds apart as directors, there are clear thematic and stylistic comparisons to be made between <em>Margin Call</em> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmopolis-DVD-Robert-Pattinson/dp/B008HDQPVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352291642&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Cosmopolis</strong></a> (2012, Entertainment One, 15), the latter of  which is adapted (perhaps over-literally) from Don DeLillo's novel. Released in the same week that the final <em>Twilight</em> movie opens in cinemas, <em>Cosmopolis</em> knowingly casts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/robert-pattinson\" title=\"\">Robert Pattinson</a> as an utterly unsympathetic vampire – a monetary bloodsucker existing in a netherworld of crumbling numbers, crawling across New York in his spaceship-like limousine, hermetically sealed from the street-level chaos raging just beyond his tinted, bulletproof windows. Treating his subject as a quasi-sci-fi text in which currency is the new flesh, Cronenberg conjures a world in which \"money is talking to itself\" and people have been cut out of the equation. Unsurprisingly, there's much to admire but very little to like about this clinically cool depiction of an all-but-undead world in which the central characters struggle to imitate the behaviour of human beings.</p><p>Pattinson is great in the central role, Peter Suschitzky's camera staying with him for almost the entire running time, leaving him to shoulder the not inconsiderable burden of the movie's deep-seated malaise. High-brow supporting cameos (Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton, Paul Giamatti) come and go but it's the under-appreciated Pattinson who provides the real engine power and who earns the right to be taken a lot more seriously than some give him credit for. The fact that a film with a star this big has managed to find such a (comparatively) small audience perversely proves its artistic integrity. I still don't actually like it, though.</p><p>Which brings us rather neatly to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Friends-Kids-DVD-Jon-Hamm/dp/B008LU8OCM/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352291703&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Friends with Kids</strong></a> (2011, Lionsgate, 15), a movie that it is possible to like (up to a point) without admiring in the slightest. Corralling the on-screen firepower from the infinitely more accomplished <em>Bridesmaids</em> (Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and actor/producer Jon Hamm), this posits two BFF's making a pact to conceive and raise a child together while still staying the free-spirited independent individuals they were in pre-parental life. The fact that any of this raises a chuckle, let alone a laugh, should be seen as high praise considering how grizzly the mutant prospect of <em>When Harry Met Sally…</em> meets <em>What to Expect When You're Expecting</em> looks on paper. The problem, as director/writer/star <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/03/jennifer-westfeldt-friends-kids-hamm-interview\" title=\"\">Jennifer Westfeldt</a> discovers, is that a good heart and an even better cast don't necessarily make for a great comedy, although only the most hard-hearted viewer would make it through without raising a smile.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD

Yet a more accurate touchstone for the surprisingly tender <strong>Wild Bill </strong>(2011, Universal, 15) would be the films of Shane Meadows, with which this shares both a tough edge and a soft heart. Charlie Creed-Miles stars as the eponymous ex-con whose release from prison is met with dismay by his son, Dean (Will Poulter), who has been acting in loco parentis to younger brother Jimmy (Sammy Williams) for years. Initially, Bill doesn't want anything to do with his children, preferring to head north in search of pastures new. But when social services threaten to put the kids into care, Dean insists that his errant father stick around long enough to tick the paperwork boxes, and an uneasy bond begins to develop between this once broken family.</p><p>Since his first eye-catching appearance in the fabulous <em>Son of Rambow</em>, Poulter has gone from strength to strength and here cements his promise as a charismatic and energetic screen presence; the sparks that fly between him and the excellently raddled Creed-Miles are utterly convincing, suggesting that Fletcher's years working for directors as diverse as Lynch, Jarman and Fernando Trueba have given him a fine affinity with actors. There's a real sense of affection for these characters, married to a disarming narrative sweetness about the way their tangled lives gradually start to form an unbreakable knot.</p><p>Co-writers Fletcher and Danny King are rather less sure-footed on the female roles, leaving the talented Liz White (brilliant in <em>Life on Mars</em>) to wrestle with the caricatured \"tart with a heart\" role of Roxy, of which she gamely makes the most. Not perfect, then, but rewarding and entertaining fare none the less, which suggests a solid future for Fletcher behind as well as in front of the camera. Extras include deleted scenes and fairly solid making-of material.</p><p>There are more crises of childhood innocence in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/mar/15/dardenne-brothers-dont-argue-actors\" title=\"\">Dardennes</a>' latest Cannes prize-winner, <strong>The Kid with a Bike</strong> (2011, Artificial Eye, 12), a brilliantly moving and ultimately optimistic account of a young boy struggling to come to terms with his father's abandonment (a recurring theme) who is taken under the wing of a local hairdresser. Seasoned performer Cécile de France and newcomer Thomas Doret are breathtakingly natural as the uneasy pair, each quietly terrified by the search for something permanent and immutable in their disparate lives. As always with these most humanist of film-makers, the small triumphs of the human soul can transcend the bleakest of circumstances, finding joy in the most unexpected places and weaving fairytale magic from the dark matter of unblinking social realism.</p><p>There's absolutely nothing \"real\" about <strong>Act of Valour </strong>(2012, Momentum, 15), a breast-beating orgy of self-aggrandising action in which \"real\" Navy Seals play with \"real\" guns and \"real\" ammo in \"real\" situations, all in the name of fatuous faux authenticity. Listening to co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh blather on about doing justice to America's military heroes by casting them in their grotty little \"war on terror\" movie you figure they must be taking the piss. But no, this really is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125574/tropic.thunder\" title=\"\"><em>Tropic Thunder</em></a> without the jokes – a flatulent, flag-waving headache of a film that insists on screaming loudly about its hard-core \"reality\" while disappearing swiftly up Rambo's wholly fictional butt-hole. Hoo ha, indeed.</p><p>It would take a hard heart not to be tickled by <strong>StreetDance 2</strong> (2012, Entertainment One, PG), the sequel to the British 3D hit in which super-athletic young people perform feats of dancing derring-do against an array of scenic European settings. Last time it was ballet; this time it's salsa, which adds spice to the mix, courtesy of Tom Conti's non-specifically Mediterranean-accented mentor. Hats off to co-directors Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini, who never let the action flag, and whose recent contribution to London 2012 was one of the highlights of the Cultural Olympiad's short film strand.</p><p>There's no doubting Robert Pattinson's commitment to escaping the romantic teen-idol status bestowed upon him by the Twilight series. Before headlining in David Cronenberg's \"aggressively unlikable\" <em>Cosmopolis</em>, he took an equally unlovable role in the ensemble drama <strong>Bel Ami </strong>(2012, StudioCanal, 15), based on Guy de Maupassant's novel about an amoral rake crawling his way up the incestuous social ladder of late 19th-century Paris. Pattinson is in good company, with Kristin Scott Thomas, Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, Colm Meaney and more all going great guns, visibly inhaling the fetid air of costumed corruption. Shame, then, that the film itself comes across as <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>-lite despite the down-and-dirty efforts of its impressive players.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD

Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; Dream House; Black Pond; Acts of Godfrey","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T00:11:01Z","body":"<p>When Rooney Mara picked up an Oscar nomination for her punchy central performance in David Fincher's American remake of<strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142850/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo\">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a></strong> (2011, Sony, 18), one question hung awkwardly in the air: how come Noomi Rapace wasn't similarly honoured for her equally impressive turn as cyberpunk Lisbeth Salander in the original Scandinavian movie a couple of years earlier? Adapted from the first of Stieg Larsson's posthumously bestselling Millennium trilogy, Niels Arden Oplev's modestly budgeted thriller made a European star of the mercurial Rapace, who went on to feature in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/18/sherlock-holmes-game-shadows-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</em></a> and is soon to be seen headlining <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ridley-scott\" title=\"\">Ridley Scott</a>'s eagerly anticipated sci-fi epic <em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\">Prometheus</a></em>. It's hard not to conclude that, while Rapace delivered her dialogue in Swedish, Mara was feted for performing essentially the same role in English – albeit with the merest hint of a Scandi-lite accent.</p><p>This is a dilemma that lies at the heart of Fincher's movie, raising depressing questions about the reluctance of English-speaking audiences to embrace the international language of subtitles. While few would argue that Oplev's Bafta-winning take on Larsson's text was beyond improvement, it's hard to see what – other than visual sheen – Fincher has brought to the table. Preserving the Swedish locations merely emphasises the fact that all the problems of the original remain: the rather too-neat narrative knots; the overwrought political parables; the somewhat unsatisfying denouement; the uncomfortable juxtaposition of melodramatic hokum and horribly explicit sexual violence. Fincher's version is certainly shinier, most notably in an oily, Bond-style opening sequence that may fit the presence of leading man Daniel Craig (more of whom in a moment) but sits uneasily with the gloom-laden tone of what follows. And while Mara's ass-kicking Salander offers a welcome retort to Hollywood's traditional lack of varied roles for women, the only thing that really distinguishes her heroine from Rapace's genre-defining avenging angel (other than her language) is her haircut.</p><p>In the end, this remake sticks close enough to its predecessor to make you wonder why they bothered. You can check out Rapace's matchless performances in all three original movies in <a href=\"http://www.momentumpictures.co.uk/home_entertainment/the_girl_trilogy\" title=\"\">Momentum's Millennium trilogy boxed set </a>for around the same price as the new first instalment. You pays your money, you takes your choice.</p><p>Somewhere in the overcooked A-lister pudding of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142927/dream-house\">Dream House</a> </strong>there's an interesting B-movie bug-house shrieker struggling to get out. Sadly, what low-budget charm this psycho-fantasy should possess (look at what John Carpenter did with similar but cheaper material in <em>The Ward</em>) is buried alive under $55m-worth of mainstream compromise and inevitable studio wrangling, resulting in the public dissatisfaction of director Jim Sheridan and leading players Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz.</p><p>Craig is actually pretty good as the haggard and haunted husband whose dream home becomes a nightmare that robs him of his family. The \"big reveal\" comes so early on in the proceedings that it can hardly be described as a twist, although cinematographer Caleb Deschanel does a fine job of blurring the line between what is real and imagined. Initially promising but ultimately disappointing, this is best summed up in Craig's own admission that: \"The movie didn't turn out great, but I met my wife – fair trade!\"</p><p>What an intriguing, and unsettling little movie <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143720/black-pond/review\" title=\"\"><strong>Black Pond</strong></a> (2011, Black Pond, 15) is. At the Baftas its makers (director Tom Kingsley, writer/director Will Sharpe and producer Sarah Brocklehurst) were nominated for an outstanding debut award, and there is plenty here to suggest that they are an ever-so-slightly surreal force to be reckoned with. The story of a family  who unwittingly achieve tabloid notoriety as a killer clan, the film mixes faux documentary interviews with off-kilter (and carefully coloured) scenes from a waking dream of life, interspersed with animated legends of lost ladies of the lake and three-legged dogs. It's peculiar stuff, occasionally funny, often poignantly uncomfortable, and consistently weird, like some subdued English relative of David Lynch's American gothic oeuvre. Chris&nbsp;Langham and Amanda Hadingue provide a suitably awkward mainstay as the collapsing couple at the centre of the drama, although Simon Amstell appears occasionally to have wandered&nbsp;in from a different (and more overtly comedic) movie as a madcap phoney shrink taunting Sharpe's mockable Tim. Extras include deleted scenes and the Sharpe/Kingsley short film <em>Cockroach</em>.</p><p>Billed as \"a tale of love, lust, loss and longing\" played out entirely in rhyming couplets, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143764/acts-of-godfrey\">Acts of Godfrey</a> </strong>(2011, Guerilla, 15) deserves plaudits for taking a running jump at the kind of insurmountable \"obstacle\" that would have doubtless delighted Lars von Trier. To writer-director Johnny Daukes's credit, the point at which one settles into the linguistic metre arrives pretty early on, achieving a sort of quasi-Chaucerian lilt that is surprisingly easy on the ear. The performances are committed too, with a rogues' gallery of British comedic thesps (Simon Callow, Harry Enfield, Celia Imrie, the splendid Doon Mackichan) lining up to play their part. A shame, then, that the puppets-of-fate narrative never quite takes flight, descending rather too often into pantomime pastiche and broader-than-broad <em>Carry On</em> oompah. Still, on the evidence of this I'd be willing to give the rhyming couplets another bash, which is saying something, frankly.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"<p>The only

Enter secret weapon Sam Mendes who, 50 years after the screen debut of this very British screen icon, has ensured that 007 has more bite, relevance and popularity that at any time in his changeable career.</p><p>Focusing first and foremost on story and character but without skimping on the spectacular action set pieces, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\"><strong>Skyfall</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, MGM/Fox, 12) establishes a template for a new era of Bond movies that acknowledges the past while looking towards the future, balancing the \"orgy of nostalgia\" provoked by the appearance of an Aston Martin with a notable lack of gadgets (goodbye invisible cars, hello snippy remarks about exploding pens) and a welcome absence of groansome gags. Indeed, the one moment when Daniel Craig's deconstructed spy seems to slip into Old James offhandedness (\"a waste of good scotch\") appears on repeated viewings to suggest a desire to cover real fear rather than mere callousness. Think about it – when was the last time you questioned the \"motivation\" behind a throwaway Bond quip? That fact alone should tell you just how much Mendes has changed the game.</p><p>Playing the razor-sharp foil to Bond's walking (-dead) wounded is Javier Bardem, long recognised as a connoisseur of the scary haircut (witness <em>No Country for Old Men</em>), to which he here adds creepy teeth and metrosexual mama's-boy menace. According to Mendes, most of the villainous Silva's real weirdness came from Bardem himself, who wanted to beef up the character into a real three-dimensional nemesis, an ambition that he achieves with aplomb.</p><p>But at the heart of it all is Judi Dench's steely M, whose role vacillates between deadpan <em>Mommie Dearest</em> and no-nonsense operational stalwart, providing the crucial link between hero and villain that drives the drama. By the time we get to the third act, with its <em>Straw Dogs</em>-siege and <em>Home Alone</em>-style DIY aesthetic, Mendes and co have cut right down to the bone with satisfyingly meaty results. Extras include two commentary tracks, most notably a nonstop analysis from Mendes, who talks enthusiastically and engagingly about a film he clearly loves as much of the rest of us.</p><p>Those in search of more may wish to track down the recently released <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149557/everything-or-nothing\" title=\"\"><strong>Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007</strong></a> (2012, Fox, 12), a lively romp through Bond history (which always looked like a glorified DVD extra) boasting a surprisingly self-aware Roger Moore, a terrifically entertaining George Lazenby and even a shadowy adversary in the shape of Kevin McClory, whose long-running ownership dispute lured Connery to the double agent dark side for <em>Never Say Never Again</em>, the film that thankfully failed to kill the franchise.</p><p>Woody Allen's non-NY films have often suffered from a tourist board's view of their settings, none more so than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149157/to-rome-with-love\" title=\"\"><strong>To Rome With Love</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Sony, 12). As usual, these characters are all travelling first class, living in a world saturated with dappled sunshine and endless leisure time, in which prostitutes look like Penélope Cruz and everyone knows exactly where their next cappuccino is coming from. The four disconnected stories here are variable fare shot through with a (cine) literacy that is less satisfying than <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, less poignant than <em>Stardust Memories</em> and less scabrous than <em>Celebrity</em> (to which the surreal Roberto Benigni section alludes directly). Yet for all its flaws, this still raises plenty of chuckles, if not belly laughs, and Woody's trademark specs are rose-tinted enough to leave the local authorities hungry for more.</p><p>The main problem with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146822/savages\" title=\"\"><strong>Savages</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Universal, 18) is that I couldn't care less about its dope-dealing antiheroes and nor, it appears, could Oliver Stone. He's far more interested in Salma Hayek's fearsome dragon lady, John Travolta's compromised lawman and Benicio Del Toro's fiendishly mustachioed thug, all of whom are noticeable by their absence the minute the young leads take centre stage.</p><p>It doesn't help that our narrator, \"O\" (for Ophelia – no, really), has to deliver lines such as: \"I had orgasms, he had war-gasms\" without laughing, but somewhere in the middle of the preachy drug war mess there's a serviceable exploitation movie (the sex, drugs and violence trimmed for cinemas has been reinstated) struggling to get out. Shame about the hippy-dippy baggage.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"Sam Mendes breathes welcome new life into the tired-looking James Bond franchise with Skyfall, writes

Buried inside the sprawling 165 minutes of<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144406/django-unchained\" title=\"\"><strong>Django Unchained</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Sony, 18), there's a very decent two-hour retro-ploitation romp struggling to escape the indulgence of Hollywood's most under-edited auteur. On the plus side, we have knife-sharp central performances from Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz as (respectively) the recently freed titular slave and sharpshooting \"dentist\" Dr King Schultz, on a mission to rescue Django's wife from the slimy clutches of Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie.</p><p>The real jaw-dropper, however, is a brilliantly counterintuitive turn from Samuel L Jackson as Candie's insanely loyal house-servant, Stephen, a terrifying portrait of head-turned devotion that offers the film's most potentially radical element. It's here that whatever rude \"politics\" this possesses (including the usual fetishisation of the \"N word\") has gnarly bite. Elsewhere, it's more fan-boyish fare, with nods toward such outré sources as Richard Fleischer's <em>Mandingo</em>, a cameo from Franco Nero, and a jukebox soundtrack heavy on dusty Morricone.</p><p>Tarantino's claim that the lip-smacking violence puts the real horror of slavery on screen for the first time is nonsense – it's more an example of the grindhouse schlock in which this revels, and that has long been his stock in trade. There's no doubting his skill as a maestro of visceral cinema, nor the tangible enthusiasm of his cast for savouring his ripe and raw dialogue. If only such vibrancy were matched by an equally powerful controlling force – preferably a strong producer standing over him in the editing room with a very big stick, reminding him of Roger Corman's mantra that very few movies wouldn't benefit from shedding a third of their running time.</p><p>In stark contrast to Tarantino's unruly style, Clint Eastwood stars in (but does not direct) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/dec/02/trouble-with-the-curve-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Trouble With the Curve</strong></a> (2012, Warner, 12), an old-fashioned tale of hard-bitten father-daughter bonding that is very \"ruly\" indeed. An antithetical companion-piece to <em>Moneyball</em>, this pitches Clint as an ailing baseball scout whose lifetime of on-the-ground experience is in danger of being eclipsed by young guns playing the numbers game. Director Robert Lorenz served as producer and first assistant director on several Eastwood movies and has adopted his mentor's no-fuss style that, combined with the formulaic narrative, makes for unsurprising fare.</p><p>But there's real charm in the chemistry between Clint's post-<em>Gran Torino</em> codger (his wounded-bear growl sounds like Tom Waits with a throat infection) and Amy Adams's long-suffering daughter, whose exasperation with – and affection for – her insufferable father rings through every scene. Justin Timberlake completes the triangle as the former player turned scout whose narrative trajectory is obvious from the outset. No curve balls, then, but down-the-line drama aimed straight at the heart.</p><p>As cheap movie locations go, the inside of a rental minivan must come top of the pile. Full marks, then, to the makers of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/may/12/vehicle-19-review-paul-walker\" title=\"\"><strong>Vehicle 19</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2013, StudioCanal, 12) for keeping the budget to a minimum as Paul Walker's ill-fated ex-con picks up the wrong hire car and finds himself in possession of a mobile phone, a handgun and a kidnapped woman he must deliver to corrupt South African police officers pronto. It all makes little or no narrative sense and barrels inevitably toward a splendidly silly climax, but it's hard not to admire the stripped-down ethos of Mukunda Michael Dewil's six-pack-and-a-curry actioner that benefits hugely from a lean, mean 85-minute running time.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, all we can do is search for the truth, learn from it and, most importantly, defend it\". Bypassing UK cinemas after a \"bijou\" US opening, the Canadian thriller <strong>A Dark Truth</strong> (2012, Sony, 15) sends Andy Garcia's retired CIA operative turned truth-telling talk-show host to the Ecuadorian jungle to confront the corporate cover-up of a massacre fuelled by money, water, and power. Here he meets Forest Whitaker's eco-warrior who divides his time between delivering equally portentous speeches and dodging bullets in firefights. Writer-director Damian Lee, who picked up a Boston film festival prize for directing this confused sociopolitical romp, similarly juggles his attentions between jaw-jaw and war-war. It's an odd affair, occasionally diverting in its conspiracy intrigues and bursts of scenic adventure, but most charitably viewed as surprisingly starry straight-to-DVD fodder (Deborah Kara Unger, Steven Bauer, Eva Longoria) rather than a rambling, big-screen misfire.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"<p>A strong editor could have helped an overly indulged Quentin

On the evidence of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142186/twilight-saga\" title=\"\"><strong>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2011, EOne, 12) the answer is \"not without a little difficulty\". Director Bill Condon may be a safe pair of hands, but even under his mainstream moderation this tale of fatal attraction, vampire babies and alien love triangles still drifts into territory in which Davids Lynch or Cronenberg may have been more at home. Certainly, Bella's descent into living death in the wake of her long-awaited marriage to Edward contains some stark visual imagery, which pushes at the boundaries of the 12 certificate. Watching her wither on the vine as an incubus gestates inside her, sapping her strength from within, is the stuff of horror movies, as is the black satire of seeing Bella sucking blood through a straw in a parody of cosy \"sickness-and-health\" domesticity.</p><p>Some of it doesn't work at all, most notably a scene of CGI talking-werewolf silliness that threatens to scupper the entire romantic enterprise and drag everything into drama-destroying daftness. Yet despite the widespread critical raspberries there's still plenty here to keep the fans on board for the forthcoming Part 2 finale, not least in the consummation of Bella and Edward's love affair which is handled with a degree of tact and much sleight of hand by all concerned.</p><p>Be warned: if you haven't watched the previous three movies, none of this will make any sense whatsoever – you really can't just jump in this late in the day. The fact that this is not a patch on David Slade's excellent predecessor, <em>The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, </em>has as much to do with the variable nature of the source material as the comparative skills of the film-makers, but at least Condon is now out of the woods and facing the home stretch. Extensive extras variously scattered across single and dual-disc DVD and Blu-ray formats include a director's commentary and behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p><p>One of the few real treats at last month's Academy Awards was the thrill of seeing Octavia Spencer grabbing the statuette for best supporting actress for her standout turn in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142864/help\" title=\"\"><strong>The Help</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2011, Disney, 12). Spencer, along with best actress nominee Viola Davis, was the main reason to get excited about what was otherwise a rather bland (and, to some critics, patronising) adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's tale of housemaids breaking their silence during the advent of the civil rights movement. It's true that the narrative suffers from the all-too familiar problems of depicting liberal white folks – in this case Emma Stone's open-minded young journo Skeeter – solving the problems of their downtrodden black neighbours. Yet the combined dramatic force of Spencer and Davis easily compensates for the shortcomings of the story, ensuring that their characters and voices hold centre stage even when the film conspires to sideline them. Accusations that <em>The Help </em>somehow celebrates an archaic servile stereotype are frankly hard to reconcile with the sheer radiant power of their screen presence in an otherwise lukewarm movie.</p><p>There's little more substance in this week's other awards contender, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142796/my-week-with-marilyn\" title=\"\"><strong>My Week With Marilyn</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2011, Entertainment, 15), although once again you'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to be charmed by Kenneth Branagh's intoxicatingly tetchy portrayal of Laurence Olivier, slowly losing his mind in the presence of Michelle Williams's quivering Monroe. It's all fluff, that's for sure, and tends to come a cropper when grasping towards a deeper psychological understanding of its troubled heroine,&nbsp;whose manipulative charms seem to seduce all she encounters. But rising star Eddie Redmayne is suitably star-crossed as wide-eyed, innocent Colin Clark, upon whose memoirs the film is based, and whose undying infatuation with Marilyn is palpable throughout.</p><p>Why on earth anyone would want to remake Sam Peckinpah's most notorious movie, a \"West Country western\" defined by its tortured spirit and deeply troubled sexual politics, remains a mystery. Like the recent fatuous rehash of Wes Craven's <em>Last House on the Left</em> (or even, arguably, Meir Zarchi's <em>I Spit on Your Grave</em>), Rod Lurie's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144408/straw-dogs\" title=\"\">update of <strong>Straw Dogs</strong></a> (2011, Sony, 18) removes some of the rough edges of the original and in doing so renders the heated debates it once raised all but redundant.</p><p>Thus, in place of the (unintentional?) ideological battleground of the original we have an&nbsp;uninteresting tale of rape and revenge of which the most notable feature is its stunning mediocrity. Reduced to its nuts-and-bolts elements, this becomes little more than an upmarket B-feature, glossed with an inappropriate Hollywood sheen, but more at home on the straight-to-video shelf. Extras include&nbsp;director's commentary and making-of material.</p><p>In cinemas, Raúl Ruiz's epic swansong <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/138609/mysteries-of-lisbon\" title=\"\"><strong>Mysteries of Lisbon</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2010, New Wave, PG) presented something of a challenge to those who did not have four-and-a-half hours to spare at a single seating. Despite its obvious cinematic qualities, this wonderful adaptation of Camilo Castelo Branco's 1854 novel is perhaps all the more breathtaking on DVD where it can be&nbsp;watched in the manner of a TV mini-series boxed set. Spun around the&nbsp;tale of a young orphan discovering&nbsp;the truth about his heritage, this rich tapestry of interweaving narratives (a \"diary of suffering\") addresses issues of class, warfare, religion, redemption, love and death, heaven and hell, all with a deceptively deft touch. It's ravishing stuff that can happily be watched in episodes although you may be hard-pressed to resist the temptation to consume it all in one sitting.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD

For astronomers looking out into the ethereal clarity of the sky, Atacama is a haven where the very boundaries of our universe become darkness visible, revealing the origins of our world. For the wives and relatives of \"the disappeared\", those murdered and buried under Pinochet's brutal regime, the fragmentary traces of their loved ones are lost within that same shifting desert, crying out to be found like distant voices, still lives, calling from the edge of the galaxy.</p><p>Elegantly, astutely, elegiacally, Guzmán pulls these threads (and others) together, proving that past and present collide on a cosmic level, and reminding us that whoever does not know history is condemned to repeat it. A stunningly moving and brilliantly eye-opening work that perfectly demonstrates the transformative power of the moving image, <em>Nostalgia for the Light</em> is a must-see film that ranks alongside the documentaries of Werner Herzog in its profound insight into the human condition. Superb.</p><p>Less philosophically earth-shattering but equally impressive in its attention to visual detail, Aardman's splendidly monikered <strong>The Pirates! In an</strong> <strong>Adventure With Scientists!</strong> (2012, Sony, U) finds Bristol's finest once again packing the screen with the kind of blink-and-you'll-miss-them treasures that demand repeat viewing. Despite being less laugh-out-loud funny than some of their previous outings, this will nevertheless paint a lasting smile on the faces of viewers of all ages. A merry mash-up of swashbuckling puns, dead-dodo Darwinian theory and (in its final stages) explosive steam-punk Victoriana, this rollicking stop-motion romp puts the digimated dreariness of most Hollywood animations in the shade. Extensive extras include dress-up games and enjoyable feature commentary. Oh, and it goes without saying that it all looks brighter, clearer and better in good old glasses-free 2D; the format of the future!</p><p>While his refusal to toe anything even vaguely resembling the mainstream narrative line may be admirable, Hungarian director Béla Tarr's previous movies have sometimes proved unendurably patience-testing; watching <em>The Man from London</em> at the Cannes film festival, I resorted to jabbing my thumbnail repeatedly into my thigh in order to stave off sleep. A relief, then, to report that <strong>The Turin Horse </strong>(2011, Artificial Eye, 15) positively flies by – at least by Tarr's exacting standards. Inspired by Nietzsche's near-mythical encounter with a flogged and dying horse that sent him into an incurable depressive tailspin, this paints an end-of-days picture of a colourless world in which the well of life has run dry and there's a mighty storm coming. Composed of trademark extended single takes, each brimful of portent and foreboding, this hypnotically powerful vision about \"the heaviness of human existence\" is ironically the director's most accessible work to date. What a shame, as he recently announced, it's also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/26/bela-tarr-turin-horse\" title=\"\">his last</a>.</p><p>Having jerked the comedy appendage of <em>American Pie</em> dry with a series of increasingly unrewarding sequels, the once priapic teens of this post-<a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0084522/\" title=\"\"><em>Porky's</em></a> money-spinner whip the wrinkled old fella out once again for <strong>American Pie: Reunion</strong> (2012, Universal, 15). While it would be tempting to imagine that with age comes knowledge, what's most notable about this is just how little anything has moved on – and just how unemployed some of these \"rising stars\" have been. Thus we open with an extended masturbation set piece, move to Stifler shitting in someone's lunchbox and thence to Jim's dad causing the pages of his son's porn mags to stick together. Overall it's like some Hits on 45 compilation mega-mix of all the familiar riffs from the previous movies, once spunky, now tired and flaccid.</p><p>At the very opposite end of the spectrum, Mia Hansen-Løve's <strong>Goodbye First Love</strong> (2011, Artificial Eye, 15)  explores the paradox of youthful infatuation revisited, as 19-year-old Sullivan abandons his Parisian soulmate Camille to travel through South America, only for their paths to cross several years later, by which point both of their lives have become irrevocably changed. Boasting a standout performance by Lola Créton, so arresting in Catherine&nbsp;Breillat's <em>Bluebeard</em>, this pitches its semi-autobiographical camp&nbsp;in a dreamy midway point between the unaffected&nbsp;innocence of <em>Gregory's Girl</em> and the unblinking harshness of <em>9 Songs</em>, building affectingly upon the&nbsp;promise of Hansen-Løve's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/07/philip-french-father-of-my-children\" title=\"\"><em>Father of my Children</em></a>.</p><p>Just time for some head-cracking action from Jason Statham in <strong>Safe</strong> (2012, Momentum, 15), in which everyone's favourite beefcake  attempts to protect a young girl &nbsp;from vile thugs in the US of A.

Dangerous Method; The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; Young Adult; Hunky Dory","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:41:00Z","body":"<p>\"Experiences like this, however painful, are necessary...\" With his hermetically sealed adaptation of Don DeLillo's <em>Cosmopolis</em> merrily – and deliberately – baffling R-Patz fans in cinemas, David Cronenberg's similarly stagey, talky psycho-drama <strong>A Dangerous Method</strong> (2011, LionsGate, 15) presents itself for further analysis from the (dis)comfort of the home-viewing couch. Based on Christopher Hampton's play, significantly entitled <em>The Talking Cure</em>, this dramatises the birth of psychoanalysis as a tense three-way relationship between Freud, Jung and patient-turned-lover Sabina Spielrein, whose contortive hysterics fire the attentions of both doctors.</p><p>Lacking the visceral punch of <em>Crash</em>, the sensuality of <em>Eastern Promises</em>, or the passion of <em>A History of Violence</em>, <em>A Dangerous Method</em> offers a strangely cerebral view of sexuality – cold, clinical, and notably (perversely?) lacking in eroticism. With heavyweights Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender matching each other in the battle for theoretical supremacy, it would be easy for Keira Knightley to become the weak link in the dramatic chain. Yet the fact that her jaw-jutting (and clearly heavily researched) performance strikes such a jarring actorly note reflects more upon Cronenberg's direction than on Knightley, who seems to be giving the film-maker exactly what he wants. Indeed, like <em>Cosmopolis</em>, it appears that – like it or loathe it – <em>A&nbsp;Dangerous Method</em> is the auteurist film Cronenberg wanted it to be, give or take a few financial restraints that result in some hokey but forgivable CGI scene-setting. As such, it sits within the canon of later-period works such as <em>Spider</em> in which his attention seems to have shifted from the more physical pleasures of the body to the loftier reaches of the intellect – perhaps bypassing the heart en route.</p><p>The opposite is true of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Exotic-Marigold-Hotel-Digital/dp/B005ZCH9FC/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340292883&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</strong></a> (2011, Fox, 12), which goes straight for the heartstrings with surprisingly rewarding results. Despite the manifold opportunities for knuckle-chewing cultural tourism, John Madden's film of Deborah Moggach's novel (via screenwriter Ol Parker) deftly sidesteps such potential pitfalls, as a group of mismatched Brits opt to spend their financially downsized retirements abroad. Judi Dench is in rip-roaring form as a widow embracing the possibilities of a new life, Tom Wilkinson underplays beautifully as a company man finally facing up to long-buried responsibilities, and Maggie Smith is... well, Maggie Smith. Meanwhile, rising star Dev Patel more than holds his own against such stalwart presences as Bill Nighy and Celia Imrie, reminding us that this deserves so much more than the \"Saga cinema\" label lazily slapped on it by its detractors.</p><p>Having followed up the Oscar-winning <em>Juno</em> with the sorely underrated horror satire <em>Jennifer's Body</em>, screenwriter Diablo Cody reunites with director Jason Reitman for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Young-Adult-DVD-Charlize-Theron/dp/B0074FREBC/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340292963&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Young Adult</strong></a> (2011, Paramount, 12), in which a writer of formulaic teen fiction returns to her hometown in a desperate bid to reclaim her high-school sweetheart by destroying his apparently happy marriage. Charlize Theron is impressively cracked as the former queen bee who brags about escaping her Minnesota roots, but whose adolescent ways betray a fatal inability to outgrow her schooldays – even when everyone around her has clearly moved on. Astringent, melancholic, and occasionally a little bit tragic, this pulls off the complex trick of presenting a deeply unsympathetic anti-heroine whose mid-life misery drives the self-destructive plot; hats off, then, to Patton Oswalt, who performs his mediating role as the bullied \"hate crime guy\" to a tee, thus allowing Theron to be as every bit as unlikable as she likes.</p><p>Plaudits, too, to director Marc Evans, whose <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=Hunky+Dory&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" title=\"\"><strong>Hunky Dory</strong></a> (2011, Entertainment One, 12) turns a high-school musical into a cause for celebration. Set in Swansea in the summer of 1976, this follows the coming-of-age fortunes of a group of youngsters putting on a rock-opera reboot of <em>The Tempest</em>, replete with some authentically impressive versions of period pop hits. Imagine (if you can) <em>Glee</em> without the saccharine and with added social grit and you're in the right ballpark. As for Evans, he gets the best out of a very impressive young cast, all of whom graduate with honours.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"David Cronenberg's depiction of the

Joe; Men in Black 3; Seeking a Friend for the End of the World; The Five-Year Engagement","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T10:11:24Z","body":"<p>Six years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/william-friedkin\" title=\"\">William Friedkin</a>'s magnificently raw adaptation of Tracy Letts's paranoid psycho-thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/115302/bug\" title=\"\"><em>Bug</em></a> managed to slip under the radar of most UK filmgoers, thanks in part to the bemusement of its distributor, which simply couldn't figure out how to sell the damned thing. Not so his next Letts collaboration, <strong>Killer Joe</strong> (2011, Entertainment One, 18), a deep-fried, jet black slice of twisted Texan gothic that has attracted the kind of attention and notoriety that Friedkin has not enjoyed since the days of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080569/\" title=\"\"><em>Cruising</em></a>.</p><p>Boasting barnstorming ensemble performances from Matthew McConaughey, Gina Gershon, Thomas Haden Church and rising star Juno Temple, this tale of trailer park lowlifes conspiring variously to bump off and/or pimp family members became an outre cause celebre thanks in part to a grotesquely prolonged scene of quasi-sexual chicken-bone abuse upon which an attention-grabbing PR campaign was built. Ironically, it's the least well-judged part of a movie that veers throughout between smartly psychotic satirical dialogue and hackneyed virgin/whore gender role cliches.</p><p>At its best, this reminds us what an unruly force of cinematic nature Friedkin can still be, encouraging a level of fearlessness in his cast that is electrifyingly captured by cinematographer <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0221042/\" title=\"\">Caleb Deschanel</a>. Having cut his teeth adapting Pinter and Mart Crowley for the screen, the director still knows how to make a stage play look anything but stagey and there's little sense here of the text's theatrical origins. Good, too, to know that at the age of 77 Friedkin can still infuriate and alarm as much as ever, showing little sign of mellowing with age, and resolutely refusing to cut the movie to avoid a box-office-killing NC-17 rating in the US. The result is a visceral assault, impressively spiky and scuzzy, although anyone impressed by <em>Killer Joe's</em> down-and-dirty edge should also seek out its predecessor, which remains the real mother lode.</p><p>Commercially speaking, neither of the Friedkin/Letts collaborations can hold a candle to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/84683/rules.of.engagement\" title=\"\"><em>Rules of Engagement</em></a>, a military courtroom drama that (briefly) topped the US box-office chart in 2000, and featured a typically committed performance by Tommy Lee Jones. There's none of that commitment in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Men-Black-III-DVD-Copy/dp/B003P9WHZO/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351682608&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Men in Black 3</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Sony, PG), in which TLJ looks like a man world-wearily picking up the cheque while waiting for Josh Brolin to step into his time-travelling shoes and inject the missing zing as Agent K's younger self. Will Smith is as ebulliently bouncy as ever, and Emma Thompson makes the most of an all-too-fleeting cameo, but it's depressing to remember just how unexpectedly sparky the first movie was back in 1997 and how corporate this third instalment seems by comparison. For proof, check out the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Men-Black-I-III-DVD-Copy/dp/B008D05XSS/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351683099&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Men in Black </em>trilogy box set</a>, which is an object lesson in diminishing returns.</p><p>You could be forgiven for dismissing the kookily entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seeking-Friend-End-World-DVD/dp/B008CP2DXW/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351683172&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Seeking a Friend for the End of the World</strong></a> (2012, Studio Canal, 15) as merely a romcom rehash of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141827/melancholia\" title=\"\"><em>Melancholia</em></a> in which existential angst is replaced by a saccharine sweet faux-alternative sensibility. Yet for all its formulaic offbeat tics (the character who loves vinyl and suffers from a lovable sleep disorder etc) there's something oddly endearing about this quietly apocalyptic affair. Steve Carrell and Keira Knightley play it fairly straight as the mismatched couple thrown together (and apart) by impending Armageddon and Lorene Scafaria retains the deadpan likability of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/feb/01/nick-norahs-infinite-playlist-review\" title=\"\"><em>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</em></a> as she graduates from writer to writer-director. Nothing like the bomb that its box-office failure in the States suggested, this may be uneven fare but it's also sweet, touching and occasionally quite poignant.</p><p>In the self-explanatorily titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Year-Engagement-DVD-Jason-Segel/dp/B006LK8JPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351684038&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Five-Year Engagement</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Universal, 15), Jason Segel and Emily Blunt negotiate elongated prenuptial ups and downs as her career subtly threatens his, with relationship-challenging results. There's a terrific 90-minute movie buried in this more than two-hour offering from the post-<em>Bridesmaids</em> Judd Apatow production stable, with the disintegration of co-writer Segel's character being overcranked for comic effect, undercutting the more recognisable reality of the movie's best observed low-key moments. It's a credit to Blunt that even when things get dramatically out of hand her droll delivery and naturalistic responses stop the narrative from completely crossing the line of credibility. Rhys Ifans has fun as a lecherous academic whose predatory shtick is skin-crawlingly spot on, and the laugh count is satisfactorily high. A relief, too,  that (in a break from Apatow tradition) there's no gross-out talking point, Segel and his Muppets collaborator Nicholas Stoller settling instead for a scene in which adult matters are discussed in the voices of Elmo and the Cookie Monster to wonderfully strange effect.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"Director William Friedkin is back on top form with a

aftermath of hurricane Katrina, Benh Zeitlin's extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beasts-Southern-Wild-Quvenzhan%C3%A9-Wallis/dp/B009HU9V0E/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360157730&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Beasts of the Southern Wild</strong></a> (2012, StudioCanal, 12) follows the changing fortunes of a vibrant young girl and her sickly father as they face an uncertain future in the fictional bayou community of the Bathtub. Based on Lucy Alibar's play <em>Juicy and Delicious</em>, Zeitlin's unexpected awards contender boasts rising waters, mythical creatures and superbly believable characters. As Hushpuppy, Quvenzhané Wallis is the youngest nominee to compete in Oscar's best actress category, while Dwight Henry had to be dragged away from his day job running a local bakery to star in the movie; both are mesmerising. The decision to shoot on 16mm rather than digital pays splendid visual dividends, lending richly colourful texture to the proceedings as they slip effortlessly between grainy realism and fantasy. A challenging treat for viewers of all ages, this really is remarkable fare. Extras include film-maker commentary and deleted scenes, along with Zeitlin's award-winning 2008 short <em>Glory at Sea</em>.</p><p>Depending upon your point of view, you can read screenwriter and star Zoe Kazan's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruby-Sparks-DVD-Paul-Dano/dp/B008OHD2BU/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360151297&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Ruby Sparks</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Fox, 15) as either an intriguing treatise about a woman being forced to conform to a twisted male ideal or just a superannuated retelling of the teen-boy fantasy <em>Weird Science</em> with books. Paul Dano plays the blocked Salingeresque writer who accidentally conjures his dream girl (Kazan) from his typewriter and then can't resist the temptation to edit and rewrite her, thus destroying the very thing he loved. Swerving between irksomely quirky comedy and semi-Frankensteinian horror (one scene invokes demonic possession), this is uneven work that never satisfactorily resolves its fantastical plot problems, but Kazan's role as author of her own destiny provides for unexpected depths and subtextual intrigue.</p><p>Like poor old author Jack Torrance, who spends too much time alone with his thoughts and winds up chasing himself around a maze in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/nov/04/the-shining-stanley-kubrick-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Shining</em></a>, film theory goes quietly mad in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Room-237-DVD-Rodney-Ascher/dp/B009WQR7UO/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360152388&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Room 237</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Metrodome, 15), in which obsessive fans search for the meaning of life in Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's chiller. As scenes from the movie are watched, replayed, freeze-framed, flipped, reversed, overlaid, superimposed and generally dismantled on screen, we hear fans, academics and madmen alike explaining that the film is variously about the Holocaust (maybe), native American genocide (arguably), sexual repression (possibly), numerology (conceivably), and how the director faked footage of the moon landings (no, sorry, you lost me there… ).</p><p>It's bizarrely fascinating, exhilarating and exasperating stuff in which every continuity error becomes a super-signifier and nothing is accidental – ever. What Kubrick actually \"meant\" remains a mystery, but this dazzling documentary stands as proof that the very best movies give to you whatever you bring to them, even if you're a lunatic.</p><p>A strong contender for the foreign language film statuette at this evening's Baftas, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Untouchable-DVD-Fran%C3%A7ois-Cluzet/dp/B00A6VGLJM/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360152801&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Untouchable</strong></a> (2011, Entertainment, 15) is a crowd-pleasing souffle of a movie about an unlikely friendship between a rich Parisian quadriplegic and his streetwise assistant. Inspired by the true story of an Algerian ex-con (whose nationality is here transposed) and his aristocratic employer turned friend, this benefits from the palpable chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy, whose interplay zings with wit, warmth and&nbsp;humour. For those untroubled by the lack of rough edges, this is proper feel-good fare – jubilant, funny and often moving.</p><p>After the boggy catastrophe of <em>Boxing Helena</em> and the sprightly career resurrection of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409345/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3\" title=\"\"><em>Surveillance</em></a>, Jennifer Lynch slips into dreary horror plodathon mode for<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chained-DVD-Vincent-D-Onofrio/dp/B00A9YBVMS/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360153523&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Chained</strong></a> (2012, Anchor Bay, 18), a nasty, derivative psycho-schlocker that wastes a committed central performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as a serial killer with a captive child. While Markus Schleinzer's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1906426/\" title=\"\"><em>Michael</em></a> presented a terrifyingly deadpan account of a comparable scenario, this merely gestures toward character insight before insulting its audience with a dumbo WTF? plot twist that will have you groaning in pain.

Stepping up a gear from their altogether more generic feature debut <em>Dead Hooker in a Trunk</em>, the \"twisted sisters\" Jen and Sylvia Soska hit their stride with <strong>American Mary</strong> (2012 Universal, 18), a film that, despite its tight production constraints, wields its ideas like weapons and packs more of a punch than many of its more bloated competitors.</p><p>Centring on a young surgeon (<em>Ginger Snaps </em>star Katharine Isabelle) who turns the tables on her abusive professional elders through amateur experiments with a scalpel, this wincingly bloody satire delves deep into the fringe world of body modification, becoming a sadomasochistic companion piece to <em>Crash </em>with real underground bite. Adhering to the Roger Corman principles of exploitation cinema (as long as you've got a couple of scenes in a strip club, you can do what you want), <em>American Mary </em>addresses issues of gender equality and physical objectification in a manner just sleazy&nbsp;enough to slip under the gore-hounds' radar.</p><p>At times it reminded me of Mitchell Lichtenstein's underrated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/121576/teeth\" title=\"\"><em>Teeth</em></a>, a tale of avenging vagina dentata that mixes gross-out with grey matter to delightfully subversive effect. Isabelle makes for a charismatic heroine, forceful and funny, while the Soskas indulge their fetish-inflected sensibilities with real wit and verve. There are also plenty of quietly reflective moments amid the craziness in which characters are allowed to breathe, ensuring that this never becomes a mere freak show. The worthy hit of last year's FrightFest that enjoyed only a brief UK theatrical outing, this deserves to find fans outside of the hardcore bat-pack on DVD and promises great things for its twisted creators in the future.</p><p>While <em>American Mary </em>may be a horror treat, the Adam Sandler \"comedy\" <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thats-Boy-DVD-Adam-Sandler/dp/B008JBZ6QA\" title=\"\"><strong>That's My Boy</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Sony, 15) is just plain horrible. One of the very worst films of last year (along with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/dec/09/life-just-keith-lemon-kermode\" title=\"\"><em>Keith Lemon: The Film</em></a>), this ill-judged barf-fest attempts to get us to see the funny side of statutory rape and incest, an endeavour in which it fails spectacularly, if unsurprisingly.</p><p>Sandler plays the hideous man-child who impregnated his teacher as a kid and is now forced to forge paternal bonds on the eve of his estranged son's nuptials. Withheld at the last minute from UK film critics for reasons that should be evident, this is less side-splitting than jaw-dropping, the kind of movie that leaves you wondering whether Sandler actually made it for a dare. Honestly, unanaesthetised rectal surgery would be funnier. If you're stupid enough to buy or rent <em>That's My Boy</em>, then frankly you deserve everything you get. Just don't come crying to me when the inevitable wave of nauseous self-loathing finally breaks over you. Oh, and Susan Sarandon – shame on you.</p><p>If the cast of <strong>The Sweeney</strong> (2012, Entertainment One, 15) turned up at a screening of <em>That's My Boy</em> they'd presumably arrest everyone involved for crimes against comedy, but only after kicking a few doors in, cracking some heads and driving a motor straight through a bloody wall before dusting down their blouson leather jackets and going down the boozer, like proper old-school rozzers.</p><p>That director Nick Love's self-consciously modern reinvention of the 70s sheepskin coat franchise should be laddy as all hell is no surprise – from <em>The Football Factory </em>to <em>The Business </em>to<em> Outlaw</em>, Love's palette is nothing if not clearly defined (although co-writer John Hodge's back catalogue includes <em>Trainspotting</em> and <em>Shallow Grave</em>). What's more refreshing is Ray Winstone's wounded-bear portrayal of Jack Regan, a dinosaur who looks admirably ridiculous in his underpants, and about whom there is a genuine air of pathos. Musician-turned-actor Ben Drew, aka Plan B, is less adventurous in the Dennis Waterman role, but at least Love's perennially insufferable mucker Danny Dyer doesn't get a look in.</p><p>Based on a Beth Raymer's memoir, Stephen Frears's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lay-Favourite-DVD-Bruce-Willis/dp/B008HDQPSS/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358536958&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Lay the Favourite</strong> </a>(2012, Entertainment One, 15) squanders a star-studded cast on a half-baked romanticised bookie yarn that will have you longing for the comparative cutting edge of <em>The Grifters</em>. Rebecca Hall is reliably terrific as the former waitress learning the betting ropes under the tutelage of Bruce Willis's crotchety old rogue and his tight-faced harridan wife, an unflattering role that Catherine Zeta-Jones embraces with admirable gusto. Meanwhile, Vince Vaughn plays an annoying, loud-mouthed asshole with appalling taste in shirts, so no change there.</p><p>It's not terrible, just terribly televisual; the sort of film that might pass muster on a long-haul flight but proves less tempting for anyone with easy access to an exit. There are a couple of tight-lipped laughs along the way and Hall continues to charm, but despite the star wattage this is remarkably unmemorable.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Possession-Uncut-Edition-DVD/dp/B006H10GUU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358537196&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">In cinemas the Jewish exorcism movie </a><strong>The Possession</strong> (2012, LionsGate, 15) showed up in a version trimmed to an American PG-13 rating, meaning that everything was toned down for the young teen market. Sadly, even in its uncut edition on DVD, this remains drearily dull fare, despite the presence of producer Sam Raimi and <em>Nightwatch</em> director Ole Bornedal. When a young girl opens a carved wooden box bought in a yard sale, demons are duly released and much hissing, huffing and general ooga-booga contortions ensue. It's all desperately derivative and frankly a bit dull. Boo! But not in the scary sense.</p>","headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up","trailText":"<p>The Soska sisters serve up a real horror treat with considerable wit and verve in American Mary, writes
