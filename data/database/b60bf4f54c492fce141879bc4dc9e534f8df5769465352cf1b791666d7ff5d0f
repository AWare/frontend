In the wake that follows he is restored to life by a great splash of whiskey. Finnegan is to be supplanted by Earwicker, the dreamer of the book. The fall is symbolic of the falls of Lucifer, Adam, Napoleon and Parnell, and indeed the Fall of man. It is also the fall of Humpty Dumpty and Isaac Newton’s apple. An apple represents the fruit that the snake tempted Eve to eat. A ladder itself is symbolic of both falling and rising. Within a black square in the top left corner of the illustration we can ‘hear’ a thunderclap. This is the first of the ten 100-character words in the book representing thunder.

He finds the overripe gripes (grapes) wrapped around a tree by the edge of a ‘boggylooking stream’. Above them is Nuvoletta, as a cloud on a balcony, spraying mist: ‘Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could’. The fable is essentially about the conflict between Catholic and non-Catholic churches, with the Mookse as Pope and the Gripes as anybody who will not submit to the Pope. The Gripes is also a representation of Shem, with Shaun as the Mookse.

The photograph is of Nora, Joyce’s wife, an inspiration for Anna Livia Plurabelle. Anna’s last line of the book is ‘A way a lone a lost a last a loved a long the’.

It does pretty much what a drowsy browser might expect: supplies a photo of its smiling, spry author on one tab; and on another, a series of posts reflecting on sleep in a mellow, hippyish sort of way, decorated with bits of impressionist art and pictures of sleepy kittens. <em>The Secret Life of Sleep</em> book seems – except for the kitten pics – to be exactly the same. The chapters are post length and retain their chummy tone and cosy verbs, pitched neatly in the blog-place that is neither letter nor literature: \"I invite you to join me at&nbsp;the shore (of&nbsp;sleep) where we can peep into the watery depths, tickle our toes in the waves, and leave the dry land of our days behind!\"</p><p>And afloat we soon are, still on the internet's infinite, provenance-free sea of reference, where accredited sleep scientists and \"dream researchers\", scientific studies and personal anecdote, can all bob about together. The going is a little sluggish, for the posts/chapters are loosely arranged and repetitive. Sometimes, too, there is a dramatic anti-science lurch, as when Duff confesses that she \"has no way of knowing for sure\" whether her uncle, in intensive care some miles away, \"actually came to my bedside in some form\" during a dream. And the lack of firm history may make you feel queasy when, for example, Duff speculates that \"Frère Jacques\", a song based on the vigorous clanging of the matins bells, \"may have had its origins in a culture that discourages sudden awakenings\"; or when she announces that \"French writer Michel de Montaigne\" lived in the 18th century.</p><p>Never mind: out here on the info-ocean, it has always been hard to tell fact from algorithm-swollen factoid. We chug on, choppily. From the depths, an argument emerges, and actually, it's not mellow at all. In fact, it&nbsp;is quite political, as indeed is a lot of recent thinking about sleep. Under the&nbsp;homey styling, Duff proves to be of&nbsp;the new \"capitalism ate my sleep\" school of thought, with spiritual knobs on. Not only does she accept as&nbsp;a \"discovery\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783\" title=\"\">historian Roger Ekirch's &nbsp;extremely) contentious hypothesis</a> that \"preindustrial folk\" didn't expect to&nbsp;sleep through the night, but habitually sat around for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours in the&nbsp;middle, meditating and raising their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\" title=\"\">prolactin</a>; but she speculates that \"our preindustrial ancestors\" were better at waking up, too. They came to \"waking awareness slowly, yawning and rolling over, cuddling and cooing with bedmates\", she imagines, in a&nbsp;scene perilously close to a kitten pic. Curiously, my friend Antigona, who grew up on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thoroughly \"preindustrial\" smallholding &nbsp;in Kosovo, doesn't recall this, nor any \"visiting\" or \"brewing of beer\" in the middle of the night. She does remember, though, working late, overcrowding, long vigils tending the sick and children – how long do you think you can share a bed with a baby in preindustrial nappies? – and, especially as a mother, being constantly, desperately sleep-deprived.</p><p>Antigona was certainly superstitious about her dreams, however, and half-awake a lot of the time – both states that Duff seems to prize. Duff does not think we should \"divide and polarise the worlds we inhabit by day and by night\", and is against all modern inventions to help us do so: clocks, especially the alarm variety; artificial light; alcohol; caffeine (which she seems to implicate in the slave trade); chocolate; all drugs from chloral hydrate to Provigil; the oxygen that sleep apnea sufferers need to get through the night; and even the teddy bear, or&nbsp;transitional object, which here&nbsp;is a byproduct of westerners' chilly insistence on solo sleeping, \"a&nbsp;demonstration of (the baby's) innate creative resourcefulness in satisfying needs for physical contact\". Lullabies, you may be happy to learn,&nbsp;are culturally universal, and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;all right.</p><p>Inevitably, Duff spends a lot of time at the cot: partly because she is not at&nbsp;all interested in the sexual side of sleep; mostly because this is where sleep theorists and behaviourists and anthropologists and Mumsnetters always end up – peering, like Varka in <a href=\"http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/sleepy.htm\" title=\"\">Chekhov's story \"Sleepy\"</a>, at a baby with colic. The baby's crying. For a long&nbsp;while he has been hoarse and exhausted with crying, but he still goes on screaming, and there is no knowing when he will stop. This is the sharp end of sleep, where the truism of modern therapy – that we are less happy and successful than we ought to be because our parents didn't love us enough in infancy – comes up against the actuality of being parents ourselves, stuck with the task of avoiding that huge, yet nebulous thing: psychic damage to our infants.</p><p>It's the business end of feminism, too: how much of your preciously realised self&nbsp;are you willing to lose to your biologically determined role as a&nbsp;mother? Or to new or old ideas of how a mother should be? How much of your own rest are you willing to sacrifice? Especially if, like Varka, you are exhausted yourself. Her eyes are glued together, her head droops, her neck aches. She cannot move her eyelids or her lips, and she feels as though her face is dried and wooden, as though her head has become as small as the head of a pin.&nbsp;</p><p>What to do? It's no use looking to science for clear directives, for there are at least as many studies demonstrating that babies may be safely left to self-soothe as there are showing the opposite. Even Duff tiptoes a little around the contentious area of leaving the baby to cry – \"some might even say&nbsp;abandon\" – she says, saying it. But&nbsp;mostly her answer is of a&nbsp;piece with her &nbsp;other ideas: in accordance with the&nbsp;precepts of Jean Liedloff's <a href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Continuum Concept</em></a>, the baby should be held all night, whether awake, asleep, wetting, or wailing, and&nbsp;this will avoid raised cortisol levels, depression in later life, and that&nbsp;teddy-bear problem. Varka's solution is more direct and&nbsp;short term: she strangles the baby.</p><p>Varka is 13 and a serf, an authentic \"preindustrial\" figure drawn from Chekhov's experience as a doctor. Perhaps it was such a Cinderella who first told one of our folk tales that feature a feather bed. There are many of them – a comfortable bed is right up&nbsp;with protein meals, gold plates and&nbsp;ever-laying hens as an object of fetish – but perhaps \"The Princess and&nbsp;the Pea\" is the finest. Twenty mattresses and still not able to sleep – there goes a&nbsp;member of the ruling class! Duff is right to identify that many&nbsp;of us are sleepless princesses, now, prickled by anxiety and text messages, by lights and to-do lists and rubbish on the internet; and right, too,&nbsp;that the intersection of the new science of the brain and our myths about sleep is a&nbsp;fascinating area. But the notion that sleep is&nbsp;an Edenic, universal, good which we&nbsp;have only recently lost through our&nbsp;capitalistic sins – really, what princesses are we, to&nbsp;have thought up&nbsp;such a pea?</p>","headline":"The Secret Life of Sleep – review","trailText":"<p>Is it time to throw your alarm clock away?

Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs) would roll out on patrol into, say, Fallujah and when they hit a bomb – \"32,000lb of steel lifting and buckling into the air\" –&nbsp;the immediate fear of the&nbsp;survivors was that this would be followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of explosions from mines laid to have&nbsp;maximum impact on anyone approaching or escaping the initial carnage. The image stuck in my&nbsp;mind because that's what this collection of short stories is: a daisy chain of incendiary fictional accounts of frontline military experience in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, carefully deployed to detonate in the reader's mind one after another.</p><p>Phil Klay is an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/phil-klay-desire-serve-my-country-us-marine\" title=\"\">ex-marine who served in Iraq</a>. But, in the present context, this is not what distinguishes him: what matters is that he is also a scrupulous and skilful writer. And <em>Redeployment</em> is the real thing – a vivid and vital battery of war stories that does not rely solely&nbsp;on its subject matter for impact (although, make no mistake, the subject certainly has impact).</p><p>I must admit, though, I struggled with the first few pages. I can't stand&nbsp;the clear-as-a-mountain-creek regular‑guy style so beloved of the faux-masculine tough-but-vulnerable narrative. And for a page or two, <em>Redeployment</em> read to me as if it was&nbsp;written by a rogue Jack Daniels copywriter: \"It was good. We got back on the plane and passed the fuck out. Woke up in America.\" Lots of \"roger\" this and \"roger\" that, and sentences like, \"Sweat a little of the alcohol out,&nbsp;too.\" Here we go, I thought, 300&nbsp;pages&nbsp;from some poor, screwed-up acronym‑spewing marine who finds himself intellectually embarrassed to discover&nbsp;that human beings have rich, deep and dark inner lives. Read <em>War and Peace</em>, soldier.</p><p>I was wrong. This was but a single voice. And, as I read on through the collection, the opening title story revealed itself not to be a sign of&nbsp;limitation but of the book's range. For&nbsp;it is definitely in the combined effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;stories that <em>Redeployment</em> garners its power and earns the comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/specials/obrien-vietnam.html\" title=\"\">Tim O'Brien's writing on Vietnam</a> that it has been getting in America. Indeed, Klay's gifts become more apparent with each new narrator and circumstance: his reach, his tonal&nbsp;control, his observational sophistication, the sheer emotional torque of his narratives. By the end, he&nbsp;had convincingly inhabited more than a dozen different voices and I felt I had learned more about Iraq than in any documentary or factual account.</p><p>In my favourite piece, \"Prayer in the Furnace\", a self-examining chaplain berates himself for daring to suggest that some good would come of suffering. He finds himself \"disgusting\" and \"vile\". He receives a&nbsp;startlingly beautiful letter from his mentor and writes a sermon citing Wilfred Owen. He is compassionate, despairing, desperate, resolved, courageous, cowardly, a foolhardy failure and a dogged success of a man, all at the same time. Not easy to achieve in 38 pages.</p><p>In \"Money as a Weapons System\", which reminded me of Joseph Heller's <em>Catch-22</em>, we witness a brilliantly cast&nbsp;Provincial Reconstruction Team struggle to make sense of the chaos. At&nbsp;great risk to all, the protagonist drives out to a water treatment plant – dark, rusted, locked – trying to locate Kazemi, the chief engineer. Eventually, Kazemi turns up and tells them that the Americans have built the wrong pipes which will deliver water at too&nbsp;great a pressure and blow up thousands of Sunni bathrooms; but as a Shi'a, he's loath to turn on the water for Sunnis because he'll be murdered. Nothing happens. Kazemi is killed anyway. Meanwhile, the team are delivered a consignment of baseball uniforms by a millionaire philanthropist, \"the mattress king of northern Kansas\", before they move on to a bee-keeping project with a handful of Iraqi widows.</p><p>Here we have a series of increasingly sophisticated portraits of&nbsp;men pulled apart by competing and&nbsp;contradictory feelings. It's no coincidence that Klay's secondary subject is male sexuality – its isolation, its neediness, its lust, pride, sometime sensitivity, sometime cauterisation. He&nbsp;writes with striking perception and&nbsp;unusual honesty about his soldiers' relationships with wives, girlfriends and lap dancers, as&nbsp;well as the Iraqi girls they see (often&nbsp;through cross hairs). There's some funny stuff – a platoon all get herpes because they're using the same \"pocket pussy\". There's some brutal stuff – an anecdote in the story \"In Vietnam They Had Whores\" that I'll leave you to read. But it is interesting that the horror of war allows Klay to smuggle in an uncustomary male frankness that makes Roth, Amis and&nbsp;the gang look elliptical and effete.</p><p>The thing that impressed me most, though, was Klay's behind-the-scenes skill with language. For the most part, the stories are planed and worked in that meticulous American manner. The&nbsp;dialogue is a lesson in how to render the rhythms of natural speech. And the poetical moments arise organically – as&nbsp;when in <a href=\"http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/phil-klay-ten-kliks-south/\" title=\"\">\"Ten Kliks South\"</a> an artilleryman tells us, \"I saw&nbsp;fires through the haze, or not even&nbsp;fires, just flashes of red in the dust and&nbsp;cordite.\"</p><p>To my mind, there are three stories that are not of the highest standard – the least convincing being \"Psychological Operations\", in which the conversation long outlasts its dramatic plausibility. But <em>Redeployment</em> is a must-read for anyone with the slightest interest in the actuality of the wars that have been&nbsp;fought in our names.</p><p>• Edward Docx's <em>The Devil's Garden</em>

A new Val McDermid, set at the Edinburgh festival. As it's against the law to write a book about the Edinburgh festival without someone discovering a&nbsp;dead standup comedian bobbing about in the Water of Leith, and as McDermid excels at crime fiction, I was tempted to bolt the door and gobble the book down in one sitting. But this novel is a very different proposition indeed, part of The Austen Project, a&nbsp;series that includes Joanna Trollope's take on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/27/joanna-trollope-sense-sensibility-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>, and promises to bring us <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Curtis Sittenfeld and <em>Emma</em> by Alexander McCall Smith, all&nbsp;with a contemporary setting.</p><p>So instead of reading gothic romance, for example, Catherine Morland reads <em>Twilight</em>; instead of letters brought in by maids, they post on Facebook, and so on. These aren't short stories or exercises in style; they are full-length novels, months of work from busy authors at the top of their game. The book itself is perfectly diverting; it follows the original plot&nbsp;very closely, and it is funny and brilliantly written. People who think of&nbsp;McDermid as a dark, intense writer will have a much lighter, jollier time – anyone who has tried to heave their way to a bar in the Assembly Rooms in&nbsp;August is probably experiencing something similar to a dance at the Bath Pump Rooms in the early 19th century.</p><p>But the real question is, why? Why do it? Who's it for? The world is neck-deep in Austen knock-offs, from the sensational (<em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em>, <em>Clueless</em>) to the lamentable (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1985019/\" title=\"\"><em>Austenland</em></a>). As an author, she has not just been done to death, she has been pounded, repeatedly and continuously, with a stick made out of a dead horse.</p><p>Austen's beautifully observed work had much to say about the marriage market, money, love and their confluence in human emotions. And McDermid echoes it, the message being, presumably, that in the world of&nbsp;practicality versus passionate love – sense and sensibility – nothing ever really changes. But we know this already: from <em>Lost in Austen</em>, from the&nbsp;evergreen Andrew Davies BBC adaptations, from PD James's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/31/death-comes-to-pemberley-pd-james\" title=\"\"><em>Death Comes to Pemberley</em></a>, from every Romantic novelist who ever wrote about a grumpy but, happily, solvent man.</p><p>And simply to take the plot seems peculiar when what makes Austen so great is the voice, the insight, the feeling for humanity (this is doubly true for <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, which may be her funniest novel, but in plot terms isn't the most watertight). Genius is eternal. There is no need to turn a barouche into a Triumph Spitfire. What would make a much more interesting project would be to take an author venerated in their time but difficult to read now; someone should have a shot at Guillaume de Lorris.</p><p>Weirdly, in its incredibly high-stakes world of lifelong mating, and despite its constipated, joke-free prose, <em>Twilight</em> – the novel beloved of McDermid's Catherine Morland – has more in common with Austen than McDermid's book does. There is some delightful social skewering, and McDermid is clearly enjoying herself, but it feels as though there is nothing new to say on the subject – or so you might have thought. It is ironic that this project is happening now, at the same time as a genuinely stark, beautiful and new way of looking at Austen has appeared. That book is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/14/longbourn-carriage-house-austen-review\" title=\"\"><em>Longbourn</em>, by Jo Baker</a>, and I very much commend it to you.</p>","headline":"Northanger Abbey by Val McDermid review – 'Austen for the Facebook age'","trailText":"McDermid's addition to the Jane Austen Project may be funny and beautifully written, but surely it's time to rework a less fashionable author, writes <strong>Jenny Colgan</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395661138682/Val-McDermid-004.jpg","wordcount":"557","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T10:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","tags":[{"id":"books/janeausten","webTitle":"Jane Austen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/janeausten","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"books/val-mcdermid","webTitle":"Val McDermid","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/val-mcdermid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/val-mcdermid","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jennycolgan","webTitle":"Jenny Colgan","r2ContributorId":"26661","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/28/1340876245226/JennyColgan2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jenny Colgan is a novelist, journalist and occasional radio pundit.

Now the acclaimed Australian author is set to address a rather more modern situation in his new novel, Amnesia: the \"cyber underworld\", with a story of a hacker who unlocks the doors of thousands of prisons across Australia and the US.</p><p>Due out in November, Amnesia was announced by publisher Faber this morning. Opening in 2010 – \"It was a spring evening in Washington DC; a chilly autumn morning in Melbourne; it was exactly 22.00 Greenwich Mean Time\" – it sees a worm sent into the computerised control systems of hundreds of Australian prisons by a young Australian hacker. The worm goes on to infect jails across America, \"because Australian prison security was, in the year 2010, mostly designed and sold by American corporations\".</p><p>\"Wherever it went, it travelled underground, in darkness, like a bushfire burning in the roots of trees. Reaching its destinations it announced itself: THE CORPORATION IS UNDER OUR CONTROL. THE ANGEL DECLARES YOU FREE,\" writes Carey as the novel opens.</p><p>\"Has a young Australian woman declared cyber war on the United States? Or was her Angel Worm intended only to open the prison doors of those unfortunates detained by Australia's harsh immigration policies? Did America suffer collateral damage?  Is she innocent?  Can she be saved?\" asked the publisher as it unveiled the novel, adding that Carey's books have sold more than one million copies in the UK alone.</p><p>Editor Angus Cargill called Amnesia \"a thrilling and witty journey to the place where the cyber underworld of radicals and hackers collides with international power politics\", and said it \"could not be more timely\".</p><p>Carey's Booker-winning novels take place in more distant times: Oscar and Lucinda is set in 1864, as Oxford seminarian Oscar Hopkins meets Sydney heiress Lucinda Leplastrier on the boat to Australia. True History of the Kelly Gang, meanwhile, allows the outlaw Ned Kelly, hung in 1880, to speak for himself: \"I lost my own father at 12 yrs of age and know what it is to be raised on lies and silences my dear daughter you are presently too young to understand a word I write but this history is for you and will contain no single lie may I burn in hell if I speak false.\"</p><p>Carey has set books in current times: his most recent novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/chemistry-tears-peter-carey-review\" title=\"\">The Chemistry of Tears</a>, takes place in London 2010 – with a back story in 1850s Germany – while His Illegal Self also has a modern setting. The author is best known for weaving history into his fiction, however, from his retelling of Great Expectations, Jack Maggs, to Parrot and Olivier in America, in which a French aristocrat sets sail for the New World.</p>","headline":"Peter Carey to tackle computer hacking and international politics in new novel","trailText":"<p>Booker prize-winner will turn his sights towards the 'cyber underworld' and hacktivism in Amnesia, out in November</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395764577282/Peter-Carey-003.jpg","wordcount":"466","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-25T15:15:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/peter-carey-hacking-cyber-underworld-new-novel-amnesia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/peter-carey-hacking-cyber-underworld-new-novel-amnesia","tags":[{"id":"books/petercarey","webTitle":"Peter Carey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/petercarey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/petercarey","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/hacking","webTitle":"Hacking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/hacking","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432962714","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395764574034/Peter-Carey-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","photographer":"Flora Hanitijo","altText":"Peter Carey","height":"54","credit":"Flora Hanitijo/PR","caption":"'Could not be more timely' … Peter Carey.

Not only was I an Oxford scholar, but so was my father. Moreover, my own daughters were at Oxford colleges, and my young grandchildren are educated in the city, too. So it could not be more satisfactory,\" she said.</p><p>Trollope's work will join the original manuscripts and early editions of works by her ancestor, the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope, which are held by the museum.</p><p>Trollope, whose career spans 36 years,  has been called the inventor of \"the Aga saga\" – a term she detests as patronising to her readers   – for her 18 novels of contemporary British life, including A Village Affair, The Choir and The Rector's Wife, which have often turned on family tensions in agreeable settings.</p><p>She is also the author of 10 historical novels published as Caroline Harvey, scores of short stories, non-fiction and journalism. The archive also includes recordings of interviews and radio and television programmes, as well as speeches and lectures. It covers her work with the Orange Prize, which she has chaired, and  literary bodies including the Society of Authors, the talking books section of the RNIB and the National Literacy Trust.  Trollope was awarded an OBE in  1996 for  services to literature.</p><p>Richard Ovenden, librarian at the Bodleian, said: \"Joanna Trollope's archive gives us an insight into the craft of an immensely popular writer, and a flag-bearer for fiction. Her novels, always handwritten, are meticulously researched and the collection provides an insight into this process.\"</p><p>In the digital age, the Bodleian librarians are particularly pleased to get such a wealth of handwritten material: she says much of her early work was been written on a country kitchen table, though she now writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/03/this-much-know-joanna-trollope\" title=\"\">a handsome study in her  west London home</a>.</p><p>The library will soon start cataloguing the collection to make it available to readers, and will also be exhibiting some of the material.</p><p>Ovenden added: \"Her act of generosity to the Bodleian will be appreciated by literary and cultural historians, and through displays, the public who enjoy her writing so deeply.\"</p><p>Trollope won a scholarship to study English literature  at St Hugh's, Oxford, in the 1960s.  Many authors or their heirs have sold their archives to British or overseas libraries,  and Trollope's would have considerable commercial value.  However, she has chosen to follow the example of another Oxford scholarship author,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/24/alan-bennett-oxford-university\" title=\"\"> Alan Bennett, who also donated his papers to the Bodleian</a> saying the gift was \"in gratitude to the nanny state\".</p>","headline":"Joanna Trollope donates archive to Oxford University's Bodleian Library","trailText":"<p>Best-selling novelist passes on handwritten manuscripts of her novels, as well as letters, journals and research notes</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395763138008/Joanna-Trollope-006.jpg","wordcount":"465","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T16:01:47Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/joanna-trollope-oxford-university-bodleian-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/joanna-trollope-oxford-university-bodleian-library","tags":[{"id":"books/joanna-trollope","webTitle":"Joanna Trollope","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/joanna-trollope","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/joanna-trollope","references":[]},{"id":"education/oxforduniversity","webTitle":"University of Oxford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/oxforduniversity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/oxforduniversity","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/higher-education","references":[]},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/education","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","rcsId":"GNL004696","r2ContributorId":"16031","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/maev_kennedy_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432992120","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395763130514/Joanna-Trollope-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"David Levenson","altText":"Joanna Trollope","height":"54","credit":"David Levenson/Getty Images","caption":"Joanna Trollope has been called the inventor of 'the Aga saga' – a term she detests as patronising to her readers.

Such a book isn't necessarily \"the best book you've ever read\". But for me there's never been any doubt: my Desert Island book would be Kim by Rudyard Kipling.</p></blockquote><p><b></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10395523\">Trevor Edward Walder</a> </b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Two I would pick. </p><p>The Paladins by John James.

The terrible grocery store I worked at had a small book section and I would read it when there was no one in the store and I'd already done the inane chores the manager insisted we do (dust the candy, things like that). Sunday morning opening and Saturday night shifts were the best for it. I liked it and made it more than halfway through, but never got around to buying it. Then I went off to school and had plenty of other things to do. I was always a bit curious how it ended, and saw a copy a few months ago in a second hand bookshop.</p><p>Its actually better than I remember, especially now that I know more about the historical figures and time period. At the time I read it initially I had no idea who Boyle or Locke were.</p></blockquote><p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/2945051\">kultur</a> had a less satisfying experience when she re-opened The Diving Bell and the Butterfly...</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>which I read well over a decade and found immensely readable, touching in fact, yet somehow looking back it did not seem so believable. This is what books do in the march of time, I suppose.</p></blockquote><p>It isn't just time that can have a diminishing effect – many Book Club readers find that films can spoil enjoyment of the books they are based on. The starting point of discussion was Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12106279\">CapeTownBibliophile</a> </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tempted to read it, but I find reading a book after you've seen the film is a recipe for disaster. Case in point: The Prince of Tides. I had seen the film and knew Barbra Streisand played Lowenstein, the psychiatrist character, as well as directing. All throughout the (long) book, the very detailed characterisation of Lowenstein was nothing like Barbra Streisand, and this left me feeling quite exasperated.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12026842\">fat_hamster</a> </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Please read the book of We Need to talk About Kevin as I think it was brilliantly written. I won't go and see the film in case it ruins the book which I re-read from time to time.</p><p>The book made me wonder if Kevin was \"born evil\" or the result of terrible parenting and whether it is possible to just be an evil person. The suspense she built up was enthralling. I was so tempted to go and see the film but didn't want to have it playing in my head next time I read the book.</p></blockquote><p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1263840\">Dylanwolf</a> disagreed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm of the opinion that WHTTAK was an rare example of the film being better than the book.</p><p>Do see the Lynne Ramsay film if you haven't - all three lead actors are superb.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/2223929\">aliquidcow</a> recommended sometimes watching the film first, so that abridgements pass unnoticed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I read 12 Years a Slave earlier this year, prior to watching the film. It's a very interesting book, though the style can be a bit distancing at times. I'd perhaps recommend seeing the film first however, since when I got around to seeing it I found myself rather missing a lot of the stuff that had been left out from the book and being a bit disappointed with the shortcuts taken with parts of the story - particularly the denouement.</p></blockquote><ul><br></ul>","headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: What are you reading this week?","trailText":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them\n\t\t","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395679638989/0367714d-97da-4a22-b128-01a8f41cf8af-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1395","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T15:00:29+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/25/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/25/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","tags":[{"id":"books/booksblog","webTitle":"Books blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/tips-links-and-suggestions-books","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/tips-links-and-suggestions-books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/tips-links-and-suggestions-books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/guardian-readers","webTitle":"Guardian readers","r2ContributorId":"35710","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>The Guardian readers contributor tag is applied to any content that is solely or partly created by you, our readers.

When No One Has the Time – review","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-25T14:17:00Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2014/mar/25/overwhelmed-work-love-play-no-one-time-review-brigid-schulte","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nnk2","standfirst":"Too busy? Welcome to the 'overwhelm'. Brigid Schulte's book is a prescription for treating our doing-too-much culture","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-maynard-keynes\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a> predicted that within a century, we would work only 15 hours a week. Just over two decades later, a fresh-faced vice-president called Richard Nixon volunteered that, by 1990, Americans would retire at the age of 38. And yet somehow, despite all the gadgets and gizmos that were supposed to set us free from drudgery – dishwashers, disposable nappies, Skype – many people in the developed world now feel they are working harder than ever.</p><p>Brigid Schulte (pictured) calls this \"the overwhelm\". The Washington Post reporter's engaging book – which is by turns a pop science explainer, self-help guide and subtle feminist polemic – aims to discover why some of us feel there simply aren't enough hours in the day. She sympathises: juggling family and career, and feeling guilty about neglecting both, she is \"scattered, fragmented, exhausted\". Not only is she doing too much – she feels she should always be doing more.</p><p>It is a common sentiment, particularly among working mothers; I&nbsp;recently sat in a room full of high-profile women in the media, discussing how they made it to the top. The answer, again and again: working part-time when their children were young, and in one case, having a stay-at-home husband. They were proof you couldn't \"have it all\", if&nbsp;that meant working 60 hours a week while raising a young family. \"With work, if it had been all or nothing, I&nbsp;would have chosen nothing,\" one said.</p><p>That is Schulte's diagnosis, too: by far the most leisure-time-starved group in society are mothers (particularly single mothers). It took decades for researchers to realise this, because they initially regarded childcare and housework as leisure time (most were men). This isn't a book that hammers you with its feminist credentials, but there is an&nbsp;unavoidably gendered aspect to our ideas of what constitutes \"real work\", even though you'd be hard-pressed to argue that a screaming toddler is the easy option compared with piddling round on Microsoft Excel.</p><p>But even as an increasing number of&nbsp;women work full-time outside the home, our attachment to traditional gender roles is hard to shake. Mothers still do far more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both&nbsp;parents work – and dads' time with their kids is often in the company of their partner, making them the \"helping\" parent, or the \"fun\" parent. Mums get to be the \"supervisory parent\", and therefore can't ever really relax. (In gay&nbsp;couples, the roles are much more likely to be equitably shared.) Such women experience free time in tiny gobbets, all the while hoping there isn't anything important in their stack of unread emails, and that odd smell isn't cat sick under the stairs again.</p><p>Fighting \"the overwhelm\" means identifying the problem, and there are three villains in this book: our jobs, our&nbsp;expectations and ourselves. Give a&nbsp;small cheer here if you live in Europe, because it turns out that America really, really hates its citizens and wants them to be unhappy. \"The US is&nbsp;the only advanced economy that doesn't guarantee workers paid time off,\" Schulte writes. \"Nearly one-quarter of all American workers get no paid vacation, most of them low-wage and part-time workers.\" Oh, and don't expect any paid maternity leave either; there is no legal requirement to offer it. All this is a legacy of the religious right's dominance in the 1970s, when firebrands such as <a href=\"http://buchanan.org/blog/\" title=\"\">Pat Buchanan</a> decided that nurseries were probably a plot to indoctrinate children and make them into tiny commies. Schulte gazes longingly towards Scandinavia, with its family-friendly policies, but the US situation sounds so bad I even felt a&nbsp;twang of pride for Blighty.</p><p>The next cause of the overwhelm is&nbsp;a construct Schulte calls the \"ideal worker\". The ideal worker is&nbsp;the perfect capitalist machine-part, never seizing up or breaking down, always ready for overtime or foreign travel, never missing a day to look after a sick child or parent. Many businesses are in the grip of \"presenteeism\", imagining that there is a&nbsp;perfect correlation between time spent with&nbsp;bum on office chair and productivity. There isn't: research shows most people can only do eight hours of quality work a day. After that, they are just desk meat, surreptitiously playing Solitaire in a&nbsp;browser window or daydreaming about dinner. A macho long-hours culture hurts men just as much as women: when new dads ask for flexible working, they get burned both by the assumption they are not dedicated to the job and the assumption they are big old Girlie Men.</p><p>We can't blame everything on heartless employers, though. The relatively affluent have to take some responsibility for worshipping at the Altar of Overwork, an attitude Schulte calls \"busier than thou\". Just as having a tan became a status symbol once it denoted that you could afford foreign holidays, so being overwhelmed is a&nbsp;badge of honour for middle-class professionals. Oh, between Jonny's clarinet lessons and my Mandarin classes and Steve getting promoted to partner, I&nbsp;don't have a minute to myself, they trill. Having no free time makes the point you don't just have a&nbsp;job. You have a&nbsp;career. You&nbsp;are Going Somewhere.</p><p>Schulte's prescription is simple: decide whether you love the bragging rights of being busy enough to live in a&nbsp;debilitating whirlwind of activity. If&nbsp;you don't, perhaps leave the clarinet unmolested and the boxercise class undone. As for housework, one researcher's message to women is refreshingly simple: be a slattern. \"Do&nbsp;you have to be able to do open-heart surgery on the kitchen floor?\" he&nbsp;asks. Also, make sure Himself pulls his weight.</p><p>This book's strength is mixing research and anecdote in a lively, accessible way, with a reporter's eye for&nbsp;detail. I underlined a passage about&nbsp;\"establishing metrics to measure success and feedback loops to course-correct\" to remind me just how refreshingly little hand-wavy mumbo-jumbo there is elsewhere. The obvious criticism is that Schulte's message speaks largely to uptight overachievers in creative fields, and being told to lobby for a four-day week or a 4pm hometime won't cut much ice if you are on the minimum wage or a zero-hours contract. (The author does acknowledge that the figure for average working hours is misleading because it obscures the gulf between the crazy-busy top of the labour market and the underemployed bottom, yet is&nbsp;otherwise prone to breezy generalisations.) But, of course, a book like this can't hope to tackle every aspect of&nbsp;such a complex subject, and even if it did, no one would have time to read the result. There just aren't enough hours in the day.</p>","headline":"Overwhelmed: Work, Love and Play When No One Has the Time – review","trailText":"<p>Too busy? Welcome to the 'overwhelm'.

It will feature an \"ethereal female figure emerging from a pen as a representation of one of the many central characters from Alice Munro's beloved short stories\", said the Mint, as well as an image of an open book, inscribed with a passage from Munro's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/05/fiction.features\" title=\"\">The View from Castle Rock</a>.</p><p>The lines, \"And in one of these houses – I can't remember whose – a magic doorstop, a big mother-of-pearl seashell that I recognized as a messenger from near and far, because I could hold it to my ear – when nobody was there to stop me – and discover the tremendous pounding of my own blood, and of the sea,\" are written upon the coin, which will retail for C$69.95 (£37.8), with 7,500 being made.</p><p>Munro's immortalisation on Canada's currency follows the decision last year by the Bank of England to feature a portrait – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/30/jane-austen-airbrushed-on-new-10-pound-note\" title=\"\">described by some as airbrushed</a> – of Jane Austen on forthcoming £10 notes. The design will also include a line from Pride and Prejudice, \"I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\", and an illustration of the novel's character Elizabeth Bennet undertaking \"The examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her\".</p><p>In Sweden, meanwhile, Pippi Longstocking's beloved creator Astrid Lindgren is set to appear on the 20 kronor note, alongside an image of the red-headed children's character and a line from one of the stories about her. The new Swedish bank notes will appear from October 2015, according to the Riksbank.</p>","headline":"Alice Munro immortalised on Canadian currency","trailText":"<p>The acclaimed author appears on a

freshman recounts the details of a romance that reaches \"the ultimate degree of intimacy\" before ending, will finally be revealed to the public around 80 years after the Cat on a Hot Tin Roof author penned it.</p><p>Like the character of Blanche DuBois from his play A Streetcar Named Desire, said to have been inspired by his mother, and Laura Wingfield from The Glass Menagerie, believed to have been modelled on his sister, the story, Crazy Night, draws upon another real woman from Williams's life: this time, his college girlfriend. Thought to have been written in the 1930s, the tale is told by a college freshman, and will be published for the first time in the spring issue of the American magazine <a href=\"http://www.strandmag.com\" title=\"\">The Strand</a>.</p><p>\"It seems to have been written when Williams was rather young, probably around the 1930s,\" Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli <a href=\"http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/rare+early+Tennessee+Williams+story+published+Strand/9656914/story.html\" title=\"\">told the Associated Press</a>. \"There is a theme of disappointment, the old 'mendacity theme' from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. He could show how, beneath the cloak of respectability, his characters had horrible insecurities and dark secrets. Williams was a master of showing the desperation and need humans have for companionship, and was equally skilled at showing how relationships go sour and lead to cynicism.\"</p><p>Set around a spring-term ritual when students would drink heavily and have sex – a night which appeared \"feverishly gay\" but is \"really the saddest night of the year\" – the story describes the narrator's romance with Anna Jean. Williams dated the student Anna Jean O'Donnell while at the University of Missouri.</p><p>His narrator enjoys \"the ultimate degree of intimacy\" with his Anna Jean. \"Both her arms were lifted toward me,\" wrote Williams. \"I had fallen between them. And the rest of what happened between us was a blind thing, almost involuntary, drawing from us both something that seemed hardly a part of ourselves.\"</p><p>The story also features a scene in which male students are paired off with girls \"in a very businesslike manner, almost like vaccination on the first day of school, each boy being allowed about five minutes, going in sort of white and trembling and coming out very loud and excited with a sheepish look on his face — indicating quite plainly the difference between an initial success or failure in the sexual skirmish\".</p><p>Gulli suggested to the Associated Press that the story could be a \"missing piece of the puzzle\" about Williams' romantic life, because \"the funny thing is that Williams's in his notebooks and memoirs went into a lot of detail about his love affairs, but with Anna Jean he made only a passing mention\".</p>","headline":"Unpublished Tennessee Williams short story sees the light of day after 80 years","trailText":"<p>Crazy Nights, written in the 1930s, to be published in US magazine The Strand</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395747767421/Tennessee-Relaxes-003.jpg","wordcount":"447","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-25T10:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/unpublished-tennessee-williams-short-story-strand","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/unpublished-tennessee-williams-short-story-strand","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/tennesseewilliams","webTitle":"Tennessee Williams","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/tennesseewilliams","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/short-stories","webTitle":"Short stories","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/short-stories","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/short-stories","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432992704","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395747763897/Tennessee-Relaxes-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Express","altText":"Tennessee Relaxes","height":"54","credit":"Express/Getty Images","caption":"'A master of showing desperation'… Tennessee Williams.

Teasing out this book's many strands, influences and implications has been fascinating – and bewildering. What does it all mean? I'm still not sure. Maybe nothing, if you believe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ATalkWithPhilipK.DickOnHour25In1976\" title=\"\">what the author said</a> in 1976:</p><blockquote><p>\"You don't just write whatever comes into your head while you're sitting there in front of the typewriter. When I wrote UBIK, I got about 12 pages done and couldn't think of anything else, so l just wrote whatever came into my mind. I wrote it from my unconscious: I let the right hemisphere of my brain do all the thinking, and I was as surprised as anybody as to what came out. In France, of course, it's considered a great novel because it doesn't make any sense; in France, it's a r<em>oman de pataphysique</em>.\"</p></blockquote><p>Darn it! But the fact that all that complication and drama in Ubik may not add up to anything also enables it to add up to everything. It is a novel of infinite possibility. It's a bravura display of narrative uncertainty. And Dick is a master at holding his readers' attention while everything falls apart.</p><p>All of which makes me very pleased to announce that we're going to be joined by Jeff VanderMeer at 1pm on Friday 28 March for this month's live webchat. Anyone who has read VanderMeer's award-winning fiction – and especially his latest novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/05/annihilation-review-jeff-vandermeer-afraid-turn-page\" title=\"\">Annihilation</a> - will be aware that this writer also knows a thing or two about keeping his readers guessing. And since definite answers about Ubik are so hard to come by, it seems a good idea to alter our usual formula slightly and question someone who has an affinity for Dick's kind of writing as well as expertise on the author's life and times.</p><p>Annihilation is full of the unease and mystery that make Dick's books so fascinating – and notably, in fine Philip K Dick style – it was <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lincolnmichel/jeff-vandermeer\" title=\"\">inspired by a dream</a>.  Judging by the buzz about the book, and the reviews its been getting, that was an excellent night's work.</p><p>I'm sure it's going to be intriguing to hear about the creation of this work, not to mention VanderMeer's influences, what he thinks of Dick himself and his opinions on the history of this kind of speculative fiction. Although we have invited Jeff primarily as a creative artist, it's also worth noting that he's no slouch on this latter subject, having co-edited a number of highly respected SF anthologies such as <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2011/08/30/table-of-contents-the-weird-edited-by-ann-and-jeff-vandermeer/\" title=\"\">The Weird</a>. While I'm noting his qualifications, I should also say that he is the winner of two World Fantasy awards as well as a finalist for the Hugo awards and significantly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick_Award\" title=\"\">the Philip K Dick award</a>. (He has also chaired the panel of judges for the latter.)</p><p>But really, I don't need to say much more to introduce Jeff VanderMeer because his words speak for themselves. You can <a href=\"http://io9.com/read-the-mesmerizing-first-chapter-of-jeff-vandermeers-1520682658\" title=\"\">read the first chapter of Annihilation here</a>. Better still, we have copies to give away to the first 10 people to post a relevant question, alongside \"I want a copy please\". And if you're lucky enough to get your request in quickly, don't forget to email <a href=\"mailto:laura.kemp@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">laura.kemp@theguardian.com</a> (Ginny is away for a couple of months) as we can't track you down ourselves – and don't forget to be nice!</p><p>Jeff will be here at 1pm on Friday – but please feel free to get your questions in early, and post now if you don't think you can make the allotted time. Over to you!</p>","headline":"Live webchat with SF writer and Philip K Dick fan Jeff VanderMeer","trailText":"<p><strong>Sam Jordison:</strong> Is there more to the bewildering Ubik than even Dick himself  would admit?

Over 90 volumes written in a mere 20 years: the&nbsp;rate of composition alone is enough to make one feel faint. And, if&nbsp;you have A-level French or better, however rusty it may be, there's the nagging sense that you also ought to be&nbsp;reading them in French ...</p><p>Here is an extremely elegant way around this problem, which will not only provide you with a thorough feeling for the joys of Balzac but will do&nbsp;so without the massive digressions that can clog up the longer works (hag‑ridden by debt, he wrote like a&nbsp;maniac to fend off his creditors, and&nbsp;sometimes you can tell he's channelling the French equivalent of&nbsp;Private Eye's Phil Space in order to&nbsp;get to his daily word-count).</p><p>Here are nine stories and novellas, all nicely translated by Linda Asher with only the rare, jarring Americanism (\"Say ...\" for \"<em>mais voilà </em>...\"; forgivable); and a very good introduction by academic Peter Brooks, who writes insightfully and without jargon. The stories feature characters from the <em>Comédie</em> – some of them are,&nbsp;in a sense, a trial run for the larger&nbsp;works; but all are in their way fully achieved.</p><p>Brooks quotes Oscar Wilde: \"the 19th century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac's.\" When Wilde said that, it was one of his great gags with a solid vein of truth in it; now, the&nbsp;truth is even more obvious. Only Dickens can compete on such terms; and if you go by output alone, Balzac blows him away. I would also say that delightful and brilliant though Dickens is, Balzac is quite simply the superior novelist, more on the alert against mawkishness. You can't imagine a&nbsp;Wildeism about Balzac along the lines&nbsp;of only a heart of stone not being moved to laughter by the death of Little Nell. Balzac is, basically, more grown up. You get the sense that you&nbsp;are reading an undeceived, undeceivable adult – albeit one with a&nbsp;highly developed sense of the melodramatic, and the potency of story itself. Many of his stories are enfolded within themselves – narrator passing on the story told by a character he meets, etc – and sometimes I found myself thinking of a large-scale version of the miniaturist Stefan Zweig.</p><p>Again and again, though, Balzac returns, obliquely but obsessively, to&nbsp;the fact of his extraordinary facility for creation; his characters lose themselves in thoughts and imaginings about the lives of people they see in the street. One of his most intriguing and compelling characters, the money-lender Gobseck in the eponymous story, describes himself as you imagine Balzac might: \"Do you think it's nothing, this power to see into the most secret recesses of the human heart, to engage another person's heart, to see it all stripped naked? It&nbsp;is&nbsp;always drama, always different: hideous wounds, deathly sorrows, love scenes, griefs likely to end beneath the waters of the Seine, a young man's pleasures that lead to the scaffold, despairing laughter, and sumptuous celebrations.\" That, essentially, is Balzac's work: never a dull moment, with ruin or scandal always but a step&nbsp;away, lovers declaring that they must love so-and-so or die – and then delivering on that oath. (This occurs in&nbsp;\"Sarrasine\".)</p><p>Balzac was also incredibly influential. Without him, no Proust, no&nbsp;Flaubert, and – who knows? – no&nbsp;realism. He was also one of the novelists who appreciated that, above all, a novel is a means of transport between very different modes of experience. He wanted, in real life, to&nbsp;build a spiral staircase between the&nbsp;Jardin de Luxembourg and the catacombs beneath; and that's a fairly obvious metaphor for how he saw his grand work, as a bridge between the highest and lowest of society. And the&nbsp;great thing about work this entertaining is that it's still exciting nearly 200 years on; so it isn't just a bridge, it's a fully functioning time machine. I strongly recommend you&nbsp;hop in.</p>","headline":"The Human Comedy: Selected Stories by Honoré de Balzac – review","trailText":"<strong>Nicholas Lezard's paperback of the week: </strong>Here is an extremely elegant way to experience the joys of Balzac without learning French","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680214565/Honore-de-Balzac-006.jpg","wordcount":"646","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T17:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction-in-translation","webTitle":"Fiction in translation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction-in-translation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction-in-translation","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard's choice","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaslezard","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard","rcsId":"GNL034660","r2ContributorId":"16172","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374241286766/Nicholas-Lezard.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaslezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaslezard","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432872827","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680206275/Honore-de-Balzac-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Roger Viollet/Getty Images","photographer":"Lapi","altText":"Honore de Balzac","height":"54","credit":"Lapi/Roger Viollet/Getty Images","caption":"Better than Dickens … Honoré de Balzac.

And chapter books, particularly series, represent a thrilling milestone, however formulaic and tedious they may look to adult eyes. Frequently the first books an independent reader chooses for him or herself, at about age 7, they often prove the gateway to full-blown reading addiction.</p><p>Lately, there's been a crop of titles bridging the gap between picture and chapter books that I've found surprisingly appealing – illustrated throughout, often divided into sections, but longer than the picture books that are gradually consigned to the \"too babyish\" category as a child's stamina and attention span grows.</p><p>For those who can't yet read confidently alone, there's something impressive and grown-up about finishing bedtime reading at the end of a chapter, knowing the book will wait patiently, bookmark in place, for the following night. To me, the best ones offer the same intoxicating, seamless interaction between text and image that a good picture book does, with an additional sense of challenge and excitement imparted by a more sustained, developed narrative.</p><p>Clear leader of the pack is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/sep/18/review-dixie-o-day-fast-lane-shirley-hughes-clara-vulliamy\" title=\"\">Dixie O'Day: In the Fast Lane</a>, a charming collaboration between the brilliant mother-and-daughter team <a href=\"http://www.dixieoday.com/meet-shirley-and-clara/\" title=\"\">Shirley Hughes and Clara Vulliamy</a>.  In a gentle, welcoming, red-and-pink world, a Snoopy/Wacky Racers mashup seen through rose-tinted glasses, live Dixie O'Day and his diminutive pal Percy, who take great care of Dixie's beloved old car. One day, they set out to race a motley assortment of vehicles – including the shiny new convertible driven by their neighbour and nemesis, Louella, in her \"special motoring hat\" – from Didsworth to Dodsworth, having several small, self-contained adventures en route. Dixie's illustrations and words feel instantly timeless and classic – and I give in to pleas for \"just one chapter\" with the minimum of arm-twisting.</p><p>A similarly jaunty and insouciant note is struck by <a href=\"http://claudebooks.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Claude, Alex T Smith's cheerfully adventurous beret-wearing dog</a>, and his best friend Sir Bobblysock. Claude's slightly manic, wide-eyed grin as he bimbles about town unbeknown to his owners, Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes, is sure to be mirrored on the face of the reader soaking up his surreal antics.</p><p>Pip Jones's big-eyed adventures of Ava and her naughty invisible cat, <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/squishy-mcfluff-the-invisible-cat/9780571302505\" title=\"\">Squishy McFluff</a>, will also be a surefire hit with any kid who's ever devolved responsibility for wickedness or mishap to a sibling or imaginary friend. Chapter by chapter, we saunter through an elegantly depicted landscape, lulled by smooth-flowing rhyme, but gradually realising who may really be behind the book's series of dreadful deeds …</p><p>And for those who enjoy gleeful gross-outs, Tim Healey and Chris Mould provide rhyming adventures of a very different kind – the \"madcap plans and crazy ideas\" of <a href=\"https://www.hachettechildrens.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9780340997734\" title=\"\">Mortimer Keene</a>, a juvenile inventor and slime-flooder of schools whose brain has been overheated by an excess of homework. These books sneakily teach words such as \"viscous\" and \"bitumen\", while delighting wobbly-legged early readers with their rousing bounce and swing.</p><p>What other books do you think best bridge the gap between the beloved titles of toddlerhood and the giddy heights of <a href=\"http://www.seaquestbooks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">BeastQuest</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rainbowmagiconline.com/uk/books/books_rainbow.html\" title=\"\">Rainbow Magic</a>?</p>","headline":"Children's picture and chapter books: titles that bridge the gap","trailText":"<strong>Imogen Russell Williams:</strong> When picture books seem 'too babyish' these longer illustrated books can help children move up to the next level","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/24/1395684262168/Shirley-Hughes-and-her-da-006.jpg","wordcount":"526","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-01T17:08:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/childrens-picture-chapter-books-titles-illustrated","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/childrens-picture-chapter-books-titles-illustrated","tags":[{"id":"books/series/imogen-russell-williams-children-s-library","webTitle":"Imogen Russell Williams' children's library","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/imogen-russell-williams-children-s-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/imogen-russell-williams-children-s-library","references":[]},{"id":"books/childrens-books-7-and-under","webTitle":"Children's books: 7 and under","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-7-and-under","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/childrens-books-7-and-under","references":[]},{"id":"books/childrens-books-8-12-years","webTitle":"Children's books: 8-12 years","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-8-12-years","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/childrens-books-8-12-years","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/imogenrussellwilliams","webTitle":"Imogen Russell Williams","r2ContributorId":"26540","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/6/23/1245756156165/imorusswill.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Imogen Russell Williams is a <a href=\"http://www.haveyourcaketheatre.co.uk/main.html\">theatre director</a>, freelance journalist, and children's book obsessive</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/imogenrussellwilliams","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/imogenrussellwilliams","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432877668","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/24/1395684252215/Shirley-Hughes-and-her-da-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Linda Nylind","altText":"Shirley Hughes and her daughter Clara Vulliamy, creators of Dixie O’Day: In the Fast Lane","height":"54","credit":"Linda Nylind/Guardian","caption":"Shirley Hughes and her daughter Clara Vulliamy, creators of Dixie O’Day: In the Fast Lane.

The book will see Carter point out \"that women are treated more equally in some countries that are atheistic or where governments are strictly separated from religion\".</p><p>\"Around the world, [Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter] have seen inequality rising rapidly with each passing decade. This is true in both rich and poor countries, and among the citizens within them,\" said the publisher. \"Carter draws upon his own experiences and the testimony of courageous women from all regions and all major religions to demonstrate that women around the world, more than half of all human beings, are being denied equal rights. This is an informed and passionate charge about a devastating effect on economic prosperity and unconscionable human suffering. It affects us all.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/03/22/292429202/jimmy-carter-issues-call-to-action-against-subjugation-of-women\" title=\"\">Speaking to the US's National Public Radio</a> this weekend about his new book – the latest in a long literary career for the US president – Carter discussed how quotations from the Bible can be used to argue for both equality and the inferiority of women. \"You can pick out individual verses throughout the Bible that show that the verse favours your particular preference, and the fact that the Catholic church, for instance, prohibits women from serving as priests or even deacons gives a kind of a permission to male people all over the world, that well, if God thinks that women are inferior, I'll treat them as inferiors. If she's my wife, I can abuse her with impunity, or if I'm an employer, I can pay my female employees less salary,\" he said.</p><p>In A Call to Action, he writes of how some selected scriptures are interpreted, \"almost exclusively by powerful male leaders within the Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and other faiths, to proclaim the lower status of women and girls\".</p><p>\"This claim that women are inferior before God spreads to the secular world to justify gross and sustained acts of discrimination and violence against them,\" writes Carter.</p><p>As well as the \"unconscionable human suffering\" which he writes is \"almost embarrassing to acknowledge\", there is also \"a devastating effect on economic prosperity caused by the loss of contributions of at least half the human beings on earth,\" writes Carter. \"This is not just a women's issue. It is not confined to the poorest countries.

impressionistic picture of a remote landscape explores the existence of evil and the human response to beauty","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Critique of Judgement, this week's poem, is by Andrew McNeillie and can be found in his latest Carcanet collection, <a href=\"http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781847772480\" title=\"\">Winter Moorings</a>. Tracing \"a north-western trajectory from the Aran Islands to the Hebrides\", the texts are sometimes given a specific location (<a href=\"http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=2054\" title=\"\">Lafan</a>, Port Sheánia), sometimes consciously de-located (<a href=\"http://www.caughtbytheriver.net/2014/02/on-not-sailing-to-st-kilda-andrew-mcneillie/\" title=\"\">On Not Sailing to St Kilda</a>) and often situated simply in weather, seascape, time. In other words, McNeillie's poetic loci are more fluid and elusive than the archipelagic topologies they source. Nevertheless, they exhale the strong breath of \"place\".</p><p>The transformation that initiates this poem (\"And suddenly the view …\") might reflect a traveller's change of perspective, or a particular angle of light, diurnal or seasonal, which reveals a new aspect of the landscape. The artist imagined responsible for these effects is gendered by the pronoun \"her\" – a neat displacement of the stereotype of feminised earth. Her pastels \"blunt\" edges and contrasts but find fresh, if shadowy, colours. When the speaker, in a nicely wry descent into colloquialism, declares, \"Things for which god knows I'm a soft touch\", it's as if he had himself been charged by the \"soft touch\" of the landscape colourist – who, as we'll see, turns out to be that old chameleon, Dame Nature.</p><p>Unexpected plurals in this stanza brighten Nature's familiar Darwinian bloodiness, <a href=\"http://www.tapestryinstitute.org/tornado/tennyson.html\" title=\"\">\"red in tooth and claw\"</a>,  as Tennyson expressed it nine years in advance of Darwin. The gauze/claws rhyme helps the effect; \"gauze\", being associated with bandages, brings the killing-fields closer to the human body. Evidence of the poet's Yeatsian quarrel with himself, the teeth and claws acknowledged by the intellect and the \"visionary appearance\" which is irrational but salving are set candidly side by side. The triumph of the visionary, some would say, indicates that there's a higher or deeper truth that transcends insoluble human logic. The poet's lower-case \"god\" suggests full concession to the secular: it's the aesthetic sense that generates visions felt as eternal truth. However, the epiphany is no less potent. McNeillie's conclusion recalls the insight Keats declaimed, via a startling <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus\" title=\"\">chiasmus</a>, at the close of the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173742\" title=\"\">Ode on a Grecian Urn</a>:  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty …\". McNeillie, too, employs an effective rhetorical device (oxymoron) when his last line indicts \"pure reason's incoherence\". There's also a Wordsworthian attitude to memory operating in the last stanza. The scene is promised to the <a href=\"https://wordsworth.org.uk/daffodils.html\" title=\"\">\"inward eye\"</a> of the poet's imagination, albeit to be recollected <em>in extremis</em> rather than in tranquillity.</p><p>The phrase \"pure reason\" and the title, Critique of Judgement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Judgment\" title=\"\">allude of course to Kant</a>. But the poem is a poem, not an argument. It admits, without reconciling, the existence of evil and the validity of the human response to beauty.</p><p>I don't know where Critique of Judgement is set but it describes a view of mountains and hills that feels familiar. I've seen it in several parts of the British Isles and Ireland. I can almost see it now, from my kitchen window. At the moment, the hills are hidden in wintry, wet March murk. But when the sun breaks through later, I shall be able to look out, and see this poem.</p><p></p><h2>Critique of Judgement</h2><p></p><p>And suddenly the view looks as though<br />An artist had been busy with her pastels,<br />Blunting the mountains and the hills<br />With mist of cloud and blue-green shadow:</p><p></p><p>Things for which god knows I'm a soft touch<br />No matter I can see through the gauze<br />To Nature red in teeth and claws<br />And hardship far beyond her crayon's reach.</p><p></p><p>This is what I call visionary appearance<br />To save me from the worst when I most need it<br />As when at any hour of day or night<br />I wake before pure reason's incoherence.</p>","headline":"Poem of the week: Critique of Judgement by Andrew McNeillie","trailText":"<strong>Carol Rumens:</strong> McNeillie's impressionistic picture of a remote landscape explores the existence of evil and the human response to beauty","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/3/24/1395664530171/Nature-calls---the-Hebrid-004.jpg","wordcount":"598","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-31T11:21:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/poem-week-critique-of-judgement-andrew-mcneillie","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/24/poem-week-critique-of-judgement-andrew-mcneillie","tags":[{"id":"books/series/poemoftheweek","webTitle":"Carol Rumens's poem of the week","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/poemoftheweek","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/poemoftheweek","references":[]},{"id":"books/poetry","webTitle":"Poetry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/poetry","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/carolrumens","webTitle":"Carol Rumens","r2ContributorId":"25452","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/carol_rumens.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Carol Rumens is the author of 14 collections of poems, as well as occasional fiction, drama and translation.

Any government worth having would countermand this loathsome and revolting decision at once, sack the man responsible, and withdraw the whip from him.\"</p><p>Billy Bragg tweeted, \"People in prison need rehabilitation, not retribution\", while Mary Beard wrote that \"Books educate &amp; rehabilitate. Crazy to ban them being sent to prisoners in jail\". The award-winning poet Ruth Padel said: \"It reminds me of the Greek junta: and even worse dictatorships. Is this government going to ban books for the people who need them most?\"</p><p>The protests began after Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, wrote <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2014/03/23/comment-why-has-grayling-banned-prisoners-being-sent-books\" title=\"\">an essay for the website Politics.co.uk</a> laying out how \"from now on, any man, woman or child in prison will not be able to receive a book from outside\", and calling the situation \"part of an increasingly irrational punishment regime orchestrated by Chris Grayling that grabs headlines but restricts education or rehabilitation\".</p><p>\"Book banning is in some ways the most despicable and nastiest element of the new rules,\" she wrote. \"An inspection report published on 18 March on Wetherby prison, which holds 180 young boys, praised the jail for only containing the children in their cells for 16 hours a day during the week and 20 hours a day at weekends. While many will not want to read a book to pass these endless hours, many boys I have met in prison do indeed read avidly. Of course prisons should have incentive schemes to reward good behaviour. But punishing reading is as nasty as it is bizarre.\"</p><p>The rules were introduced in November, putting in place a blanket ban on families sending in small items to prisoners. \"The general presumption will be that items for prisoners will not be handed in or sent in by their friends or families unless there are exceptional circumstances,\" runs the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov.uk/offenders/psis/prison-service-instructions-2013\" title=\"\">text from the Ministry of Justice </a>.</p><p>Haddon asked: \"Do you want people released into the community who have been retrained, who are more liberal and humane, or people who have been relentlessly deprived of the things we all feel are important in life? People tend to think there's us, and then there are prisoners, but these are people who will be our future neighbours and colleagues.\"</p><p>Grant said banning books from being sent into prisons \"seems to me manifestly wrong\". \"It just seems to me to be part of a system of denying rehabilitation, saying it doesn't matter,\" she said. \"I know there are prison libraries but all libraries are facing cuts … Education is a really important part of rehabilitation in my view, and [not allowing it] seems to me to be vindictive.\"</p><p>Crook said this morning that she was \"very pleased\" to see the amount of support her piece had generated. \"Because of overall cuts in prison resources it means people are locked in cells from Friday lunchtime to Monday morning, and during the week they are locked up for 20 hours a day. If you are stuck in a cell the size of a small lavatory – which includes a lavatory – you can watch television or read a book – there's nothing much else you can do,\" she said. \"So reading is literally a lifeline and a lifesaver for some people.\"</p><p>Of course there are prison libraries, but \"1,600 prisoners with one small library will only get there once every two to three weeks, if they are lucky, and they are only able to take a limited number of books out,\" said Crook. \"Also, prisoners might have a particular interest, like trains or bird watching or foreign languages, and a small prison library wouldn't have books for their interests.\"</p><p>The ban, she said, is \"bizarre, and nasty … and is having a real effect on people's lives\".</p><p>At English PEN, director Jo Glanville said the situation was something the free speech organisation had \"real concerns\" about. \"We do a significant amount of work in prisons and we have seen the extraordinary importance of books and literature and access to creative expression,\" she said.</p><p>Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: \"The notion we are banning books in prisons is complete nonsense.  All prisoners can have up to 12 books in their cells at any one time, and all prisoners have access to the prison library. Under the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme, if prisoners engage with their rehabilitation and comply with the regime they can have greater access to funds to buy items including books.\"</p>","headline":"Mark Haddon helps launch online petition against prisoner's book ban","trailText":"<p>Writers including Philip Pullman have criticised a Ministry of Justice ban on books sent

Part one, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/25/death-in-family-karl-ove-knausgaard-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Death in the Family</em></a>, recounted the author's rural adolescence before exposing the squalor in which his father passed his final years. \"Dad\", otherwise unidentified for legal reasons, was a teacher and local councillor who dropped dead when Knausgaard was 29, following a midlife crisis that saw him change his name and start a new family before he turned to drink and moved back in with his own mother, also an alcoholic. After his death, Knausgaard and his older brother discover piles of clothes caked in excrement, empty bottles and half-eaten ready meals on every surface.</p><p>Part two was just as graphic. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/man-in-love-knausgaard-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Man in Love</em></a> (these titles come from the British publishers), Knausgaard ditches his wife to move to Stockholm and marry a poet. His response when she first spurns his advances – he's still married at the time – is to cut his own face with glass. They have three children, described without irony as an \"invasion\" that imperils a longed-for magnum opus. Time, he complains, is \"running through my fingers like sand while I… do what? Clean floors, wash clothes, make dinner, wash up, go&nbsp;shopping, play with the children in the play areas, bring them home, undress them, bath them, look after them until it is bedtime, tuck them in, hang some clothes to dry, fold others and put them away, tidy up, wipe tables, chairs and cupboards.\"</p><p>In America, it's been argued that Knausgaard fails to appreciate his good fortune in living in Sweden, where the state helps him raise a family on what he and his wife make from writing. It may be the prickliest way to say what Knausgaard's sceptics often suggest – that he should lighten up. He almost begs for the response, and not just in his title. His caveat to the admission that his kids do after all bring him joy is 24-carat Scandi-gloom: \"Joy is not my goal, never has been, what good is joy to me?\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432678117'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395076670638/min-kamp-boyhood-island-004.jpg' alt='min kamp boyhood island' width='220' height='221' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The worst of times: Knausgaard with his father and older brother, early 1970s.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Boyhood Island</em>, the latest volume to come out in English, makes clear that, with a father like Knausgaard's, anyone might struggle to turn their frown upside down. \"Dad had got what was coming to him, it was good that he was dead,\" the first book told us. Part three shows us what a tyrant he was, as the author recalls life on a housing estate in 1970s Norway from ages six to 13. Time and again the young Knausgaard is sent to bed without supper for such crimes as losing a sock or switching on the TV. One evening his father gives him an apple. \"Thanks, but I only eat one a day,\" the boy says. His father counters that he saw him eat two the previous evening. So in the apple goes. \"Here's another. This is your lucky day.\" Knausgaard forces it down before his father inflicts a fourth on him. \"I hope that has taught you a lesson.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/zadiesmith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZadieSmith\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> after reading <em>A Man in Love</em> that she needed this book \"like crack\". But even the most avid Knaus-fiend might concede  that this isn't the revelation past volumes were, partly because the injustices of boyhood are better documented than those of fatherhood, but mainly because Knausgaard fixes the point of view to his child self; gone is the fluid structure that drifted between the remembered moment and the moment of remembering. Outside the domestic psychodrama the action is much as you'd expect: stuff about masturbation and pissing contests, drumming in a punk band, and the torment of having to wear the women's swimming cap his&nbsp;mum buys him. Knausgaard spends&nbsp;a lot of time with the word \"Trauma\" on his back – the name of his junior football team, as he explains solemnly to an amused visitor.</p><p>In <em>A Death in the Family</em>, Knausgaard recalls hearing that his mother once threatened to leave when he was small because his father had thrown him in an ice-cold bath to stop him crying. She stays; it's his father who leaves. The puzzle of why he went off the rails after torturing his sons seems to be what inspired <em>My Struggle</em>: apparently Knausgaard spent years trying to put him into a novel, succeeding only once he turned his back on almost a decade of creative writing study to let himself spill out his prose rather than pare it down. While <em>Boyhood Island</em> shows no sign he'll solve the mystery of Knausgaard Sr, reports suggest the final volume announces his retirement from writing altogether, so it's more than just hyperbole to say he's given it everything he's got.</p>","headline":"Boyhood Island review – the 'masterpiece for the age of the selfie' continues","trailText":"<p>The latest volume of Karl Ove

A group whose every move is tracked, whose freedom of movement is prohibited, and whose ability to associate with individuals of their choice has heavy restrictions placed upon it: teenagers. Or at least, the subject of this  book: American teenagers.</p><p>It is based on eight years of research by <a href=\"http://www.danah.org\" title=\"\">Danah Boyd,</a> a principal researcher at Microsoft, as well as an assistant professor at New York University. She describes herself as one of the first cohort of teenagers who grew up online in the 1990s (which may or may not explain why she styles herself as \"danah boyd\") – and the book is grounded in hard academic research: proper interviews conducted with actual teenagers. What comes across most strongly, more so than the various \"myths\" and \"panics\" that the author describes, is just how narrow and circumscribed many of these teenager's lives have become. Policed by their parents, banned, in the US at least, from many open spaces such as shopping malls, not allowed to ride on a bus unchaperoned, online public space is for many of them the only public space they have.</p><p>The rise of Instagram, Tumblr and Snapchat, says Boyd, is at least partly a quest for teenagers to find online forums that their parents haven't yet colonised, though the sheer speed in the change of technology is apparent on almost every page of the book. In many of her examples, these teenagers refer to MySpace, once the digital bleeding edge, now the embarrassing gran of the social media age, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal\" title=\"\">WhatsApp</a>, the latest tech sensation whose success has been largely fuelled by teenagers, isn't mentioned once.</p><p>But then, that's the point, says Boyd. There's an awful lot of stuff that looks different, but is essentially the same. Teenagers like chatting to their friends; there's nothing new in this. And most teenagers aren't \"addicted\" to their phones, or their computers: they're addicted to their friendship groups.</p><p><em>It's Complicated</em> isn't the raciest of reads; it's dry, academic and Boyd does not shy away from the blindingly obvious (\"Along with planes, running water, electricity and motorised transportation, the internet is now a fundamental fact of modern life.\") but there are, nonetheless, a lot of interesting observations here: that most teenagers aren't \"digital natives\" as we like to believe. Everybody Boyd talks to, adults and teenagers alike, \"expresses reverence to Google\"; many believe that its results are checked by a human, and almost no one knows what an algorithm is or understands what it does. And the uptake of technology, is, like almost everything in life, shaped by class, by race, by economic circumstances. The white teenagers Boyd interviews have fancier phones than the black ones, and the social interactions online follow the same segregated lines she observes in American high schools.</p><p>Technology is neither the solution, nor the problem, she claims. And even our most cherished beliefs about teenagers' online behaviour – that they have no sense of privacy, that \"sharing is akin to breathing – turn out to be more complicated than we suspect. \"In North Carolina, I asked 'Waffles' about this issue, and he responded with exasperation. 'Every teenager wants privacy.

The reviews were dreadful, the sales poor, and it was not until many years after Wilde's death that this remarkable work of imagination was recognised as a classic.</p><p>Its gestation was troubled, too. First commissioned in the summer of 1889 by an American editor for <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>, Wilde initially submitted a fairy tale \"The Fisherman and his Soul\", which was rejected. Eventually, his typescript for <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> was delivered in April 1890, whereupon <em>Lippincott's </em>editor declared that \"in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to\".</p><p>In the light of several subsequent reviews, this was a comparatively mild critique. Wilde himself was steadfast in defending his author's vision. He always maintained that the Faustian idea of Dorian Gray, \"the idea of a young man selling his soul in exchange for eternal youth\", was \"old in the history of literature\". But when he gave an archetypal story a striking contemporary spin, with strong homoerotic undertones, he stirred up a furore of hostility.</p><p>Reread today, however, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> is a wonderfully entertaining parable of the aesthetic ideal (art for art's sake), and a sneak preview of the brilliance exhibited in plays such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NFQbeE9gkQ\" title=\"\"><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></a> and <em>Lady Windermere's Fan</em>. What began as an outré, decadent novella, now seems more like an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic, than the depraved fiction alleged by his outraged critics.</p><p>Dorian Gray is the impossibly beautiful young man who becomes the subject of a portrait by the fashionable society painter, Basil Hallward. When the artist, who has become infatuated with his model, introduces the \"young Adonis\" to Lord Henry Wotton, he is rapidly seduced by the peer's witty and corrupting devotion to <em>fin-de-siècle</em> hedonism, some of it inspired by Wilde's own experience.</p><p>Among the influences that shaped the book, I would argue that Disraeli (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels\" title=\"\">No 11 in this series</a>) is a ghostly godfather to the novel. Wilde tips his hat not only to Disraeli's <em>Sybil</em>, but also to <em>Vivian Grey</em>, his first novel. Closer to his own time, Wilde also took inspiration from Robert Louis Stevenson and <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>. There was something about the literary alter ego that held a peculiar fascination for late Victorians.</p><p>Under the malign influence of Lord Henry – \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it\", is one of many Wildean epigrams scattered through the text – Dorian Gray plunges into a decadent and sinister milieu, becoming a slave to drugs and debauchery. His fatal love affair with the actress Sybil Vane alerts him to the secret of his eternal youth: he will remain untarnished while his portrait reflects the hideous corruption of his soul.</p><p>Eventually despairing, the young man blames the artist Hallward for his fate, and murders him. But Dorian Gray can never \"be at peace\". Finally, in a horrifying climax, he takes a knife to his own portrait. When his servants find him, the picture depicts their youthful master as they had once known him. The corpse next to it is as \"withered, wrinkled and loathsome of visage\" as the portrait had been. Art and life are back in harmony, as Wilde intended, and his brilliantly allusive moral tale is complete.</p><p>When the magazine version of <em>Dorian Gray</em> was published, there were howls of protest. Some reviewers declared that, far from exposing immorality, Wilde wanted to promote it. Elsewhere, the story was greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend his novel in letters to the press. One reviewer for a newspaper which declared that <em>Lippincott's</em> should be \"ashamed to circulate\" such filth, refused to describe the contents of the novel because he did not wish to \"advertise the developments of an esoteric prurience\".</p><p>As well as talk of prosecution, there was a strong hint of Francophobia against the decadent \"yellow book\" Lord Henry gives Dorian to recruit him to his belief in \"Art\". The <em>Daily Chronicle</em> found the novel to be \"a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French decadents\". More dangerous were the attempts of some reviewers to link the novel to the Cleveland Street affair of 1889. This scandal, centred on a male brothel frequented by an upper-class clientele that included members of the British political elite, was an eerie forerunner, in its exposure of the demi-monde, of the Queensberry libel case that would eventually destroy Wilde in 1895.</p><h2>A note on the text</h2><p><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Wilde's only novel, was published on 20 June 1890 in the July edition of <em>Lippincott's</em>, as a novella of 13 chapters, and was the leading contribution to the magazine. Several British reviewers condemned the book for immorality. The novel became so controversial that WH Smith withdrew that month's edition of <em>Lippincott's</em> from its railway station bookstalls.</p><p>In fact, the magazine's editors, fearful of charges of \"indecency\" had already cut some 500 words, without Wilde's knowledge, before publication. Deletions to Wilde's typescript included the elimination of several passages alluding to homosexual desire, and the deletion of three references to Gray's female lovers Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton as his \"mistresses\". Wilde, it must be said, conducted himself during this campaign, with impressive dignity and composure.</p><p>Later, Wilde himself further revised the story for book publication, making significant alterations, cutting the most controversial passages, adding new chapters, and including a preface that has since become famous in its own right as his defence of art for art's sake. The amended version, extended from 13 to 20 chapters, was published in a single volume by Ward Lock &amp; Co, in April 1891. This is now the standard version of the text.</p><h2>Other essential Wilde titles</h2><p><em>The Picture of Mr WH</em> (1889); <em>The Happy Prince &amp; Other Tales</em> (1888); <em>De Profundis</em> (1897).</p>","headline":"The 100 best novels: No 27 – The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1891)","trailText":"<p>Wilde's brilliantly allusive moral tale of youth, beauty and corruption was greeted with howls of protest on publication, writes <strong>Robert McCrum</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395080455080/100-best-novels-dorian-004.jpg","wordcount":"996","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-13T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde","tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[]},{"id":"culture/oscar-wilde","webTitle":"Oscar Wilde","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/oscar-wilde","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","rcsId":"GNL042186","r2ContributorId":"15288","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/robert_mccrum_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

The fall is symbolic of the falls of Lucifer, Adam, Napoleon and Parnell, and indeed the Fall of man. It is also the fall of Humpty Dumpty and Isaac Newton’s apple. An apple represents the fruit that the snake tempted Eve to eat. A ladder itself is symbolic of both falling and rising. Within a black square in the top left corner of the illustration we can ‘hear’ a thunderclap. This is the first of the ten 100-character words in the book representing thunder.

The cad tells his wife about HCE’s alleged lewd behaviour and his wife tells a priest over a cup of tea, who in turn tells a professor at the races, who lets everybody know about it.

He finds the overripe gripes (grapes) wrapped around a tree by the edge of a ‘boggylooking stream’. Above them is Nuvoletta, as a cloud on a balcony, spraying mist: ‘Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could’. The fable is essentially about the conflict between Catholic and non-Catholic churches, with the Mookse as Pope and the Gripes as anybody who will not submit to the Pope.

Kat Duff is of the 'capitalism ate my sleep' school and wants a return to old-fashioned ways","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>The Secret Life of Sleep</em> started out as a blog, for the \"sleepy, the sleepless and the curious\" written by a \"licensed counsellor\" from the New Mexican desert. It does pretty much what a drowsy browser might expect: supplies a photo of its smiling, spry author on one tab; and on another, a series of posts reflecting on sleep in a mellow, hippyish sort of way, decorated with bits of impressionist art and pictures of sleepy kittens. <em>The Secret Life of Sleep</em> book seems – except for the kitten pics – to be exactly the same. The chapters are post length and retain their chummy tone and cosy verbs, pitched neatly in the blog-place that is neither letter nor literature: \"I invite you to join me at&nbsp;the shore (of&nbsp;sleep) where we can peep into the watery depths, tickle our toes in the waves, and leave the dry land of our days behind!\"</p><p>And afloat we soon are, still on the internet's infinite, provenance-free sea of reference, where accredited sleep scientists and \"dream researchers\", scientific studies and personal anecdote, can all bob about together. The going is a little sluggish, for the posts/chapters are loosely arranged and repetitive. Sometimes, too, there is a dramatic anti-science lurch, as when Duff confesses that she \"has no way of knowing for sure\" whether her uncle, in intensive care some miles away, \"actually came to my bedside in some form\" during a dream. And the lack of firm history may make you feel queasy when, for example, Duff speculates that \"Frère Jacques\", a song based on the vigorous clanging of the matins bells, \"may have had its origins in a culture that discourages sudden awakenings\"; or when she announces that \"French writer Michel de Montaigne\" lived in the 18th century.</p><p>Never mind: out here on the info-ocean, it has always been hard to tell fact from algorithm-swollen factoid. We chug on, choppily. From the depths, an argument emerges, and actually, it's not mellow at all. In fact, it&nbsp;is quite political, as indeed is a lot of recent thinking about sleep. Under the&nbsp;homey styling, Duff proves to be of&nbsp;the new \"capitalism ate my sleep\" school of thought, with spiritual knobs on. Not only does she accept as&nbsp;a \"discovery\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783\" title=\"\">historian Roger Ekirch's &nbsp;extremely) contentious hypothesis</a> that \"preindustrial folk\" didn't expect to&nbsp;sleep through the night, but habitually sat around for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours in the&nbsp;middle, meditating and raising their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\" title=\"\">prolactin</a>; but she speculates that \"our preindustrial ancestors\" were better at waking up, too. They came to \"waking awareness slowly, yawning and rolling over, cuddling and cooing with bedmates\", she imagines, in a&nbsp;scene perilously close to a kitten pic. Curiously, my friend Antigona, who grew up on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thoroughly \"preindustrial\" smallholding &nbsp;in Kosovo, doesn't recall this, nor any \"visiting\" or \"brewing of beer\" in the middle of the night. She does remember, though, working late, overcrowding, long vigils tending the sick and children – how long do you think you can share a bed with a baby in preindustrial nappies? – and, especially as a mother, being constantly, desperately sleep-deprived.</p><p>Antigona was certainly superstitious about her dreams, however, and half-awake a lot of the time – both states that Duff seems to prize. Duff does not think we should \"divide and polarise the worlds we inhabit by day and by night\", and is against all modern inventions to help us do so: clocks, especially the alarm variety; artificial light; alcohol; caffeine (which she seems to implicate in the slave trade); chocolate; all drugs from chloral hydrate to Provigil; the oxygen that sleep apnea sufferers need to get through the night; and even the teddy bear, or&nbsp;transitional object, which here&nbsp;is a byproduct of westerners' chilly insistence on solo sleeping, \"a&nbsp;demonstration of (the baby's) innate creative resourcefulness in satisfying needs for physical contact\". Lullabies, you may be happy to learn,&nbsp;are culturally universal, and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;all right.</p><p>Inevitably, Duff spends a lot of time at the cot: partly because she is not at&nbsp;all interested in the sexual side of sleep; mostly because this is where sleep theorists and behaviourists and anthropologists and Mumsnetters always end up – peering, like Varka in <a href=\"http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/sleepy.htm\" title=\"\">Chekhov's story \"Sleepy\"</a>, at a baby with colic. The baby's crying. For a long&nbsp;while he has been hoarse and exhausted with crying, but he still goes on screaming, and there is no knowing when he will stop. This is the sharp end of sleep, where the truism of modern therapy – that we are less happy and successful than we ought to be because our parents didn't love us enough in infancy – comes up against the actuality of being parents ourselves, stuck with the task of avoiding that huge, yet nebulous thing: psychic damage to our infants.</p><p>It's the business end of feminism, too: how much of your preciously realised self&nbsp;are you willing to lose to your biologically determined role as a&nbsp;mother? Or to new or old ideas of how a mother should be? How much of your own rest are you willing to sacrifice? Especially if, like Varka, you are exhausted yourself. Her eyes are glued together, her head droops, her neck aches. She cannot move her eyelids or her lips, and she feels as though her face is dried and wooden, as though her head has become as small as the head of a pin.&nbsp;</p><p>What to do? It's no use looking to science for clear directives, for there are at least as many studies demonstrating that babies may be safely left to self-soothe as there are showing the opposite. Even Duff tiptoes a little around the contentious area of leaving the baby to cry – \"some might even say&nbsp;abandon\" – she says, saying it. But&nbsp;mostly her answer is of a&nbsp;piece with her &nbsp;other ideas: in accordance with the&nbsp;precepts of Jean Liedloff's <a href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Continuum Concept</em></a>, the baby should be held all night, whether awake, asleep, wetting, or wailing, and&nbsp;this will avoid raised cortisol levels, depression in later life, and that&nbsp;teddy-bear problem. Varka's solution is more direct and&nbsp;short term: she strangles the baby.</p><p>Varka is 13 and a serf, an authentic \"preindustrial\" figure drawn from Chekhov's experience as a doctor. Perhaps it was such a Cinderella who first told one of our folk tales that feature a feather bed. There are many of them – a comfortable bed is right up&nbsp;with protein meals, gold plates and&nbsp;ever-laying hens as an object of fetish – but perhaps \"The Princess and&nbsp;the Pea\" is the finest. Twenty mattresses and still not able to sleep – there goes a&nbsp;member of the ruling class! Duff is right to identify that many&nbsp;of us are sleepless princesses, now, prickled by anxiety and text messages, by lights and to-do lists and rubbish on the internet; and right, too,&nbsp;that the intersection of the new science of the brain and our myths about sleep is a&nbsp;fascinating area. But the notion that sleep is&nbsp;an Edenic, universal, good which we&nbsp;have only recently lost through our&nbsp;capitalistic sins – really, what princesses are we, to&nbsp;have thought up&nbsp;such a pea?</p>","headline":"The Secret Life of Sleep – review","trailText":"<p>Is it time to throw your alarm clock away?

Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs) would roll out on patrol into, say, Fallujah and when they hit a bomb – \"32,000lb of steel lifting and buckling into the air\" –&nbsp;the immediate fear of the&nbsp;survivors was that this would be followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of explosions from mines laid to have&nbsp;maximum impact on anyone approaching or escaping the initial carnage. The image stuck in my&nbsp;mind because that's what this collection of short stories is: a daisy chain of incendiary fictional accounts of frontline military experience in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, carefully deployed to detonate in the reader's mind one after another.</p><p>Phil Klay is an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/phil-klay-desire-serve-my-country-us-marine\" title=\"\">ex-marine who served in Iraq</a>. But, in the present context, this is not what distinguishes him: what matters is that he is also a scrupulous and skilful writer. And <em>Redeployment</em> is the real thing – a vivid and vital battery of war stories that does not rely solely&nbsp;on its subject matter for impact (although, make no mistake, the subject certainly has impact).</p><p>I must admit, though, I struggled with the first few pages. I can't stand&nbsp;the clear-as-a-mountain-creek regular‑guy style so beloved of the faux-masculine tough-but-vulnerable narrative. And for a page or two, <em>Redeployment</em> read to me as if it was&nbsp;written by a rogue Jack Daniels copywriter: \"It was good. We got back on the plane and passed the fuck out. Woke up in America.\" Lots of \"roger\" this and \"roger\" that, and sentences like, \"Sweat a little of the alcohol out,&nbsp;too.\" Here we go, I thought, 300&nbsp;pages&nbsp;from some poor, screwed-up acronym‑spewing marine who finds himself intellectually embarrassed to discover&nbsp;that human beings have rich, deep and dark inner lives. Read <em>War and Peace</em>, soldier.</p><p>I was wrong. This was but a single voice. And, as I read on through the collection, the opening title story revealed itself not to be a sign of&nbsp;limitation but of the book's range. For&nbsp;it is definitely in the combined effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;stories that <em>Redeployment</em> garners its power and earns the comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/specials/obrien-vietnam.html\" title=\"\">Tim O'Brien's writing on Vietnam</a> that it has been getting in America. Indeed, Klay's gifts become more apparent with each new narrator and circumstance: his reach, his tonal&nbsp;control, his observational sophistication, the sheer emotional torque of his narratives. By the end, he&nbsp;had convincingly inhabited more than a dozen different voices and I felt I had learned more about Iraq than in any documentary or factual account.</p><p>In my favourite piece, \"Prayer in the Furnace\", a self-examining chaplain berates himself for daring to suggest that some good would come of suffering. He finds himself \"disgusting\" and \"vile\". He receives a&nbsp;startlingly beautiful letter from his mentor and writes a sermon citing Wilfred Owen. He is compassionate, despairing, desperate, resolved, courageous, cowardly, a foolhardy failure and a dogged success of a man, all at the same time. Not easy to achieve in 38 pages.</p><p>In \"Money as a Weapons System\", which reminded me of Joseph Heller's <em>Catch-22</em>, we witness a brilliantly cast&nbsp;Provincial Reconstruction Team struggle to make sense of the chaos. At&nbsp;great risk to all, the protagonist drives out to a water treatment plant – dark, rusted, locked – trying to locate Kazemi, the chief engineer. Eventually, Kazemi turns up and tells them that the Americans have built the wrong pipes which will deliver water at too&nbsp;great a pressure and blow up thousands of Sunni bathrooms; but as a Shi'a, he's loath to turn on the water for Sunnis because he'll be murdered. Nothing happens. Kazemi is killed anyway. Meanwhile, the team are delivered a consignment of baseball uniforms by a millionaire philanthropist, \"the mattress king of northern Kansas\", before they move on to a bee-keeping project with a handful of Iraqi widows.</p><p>Here we have a series of increasingly sophisticated portraits of&nbsp;men pulled apart by competing and&nbsp;contradictory feelings. It's no coincidence that Klay's secondary subject is male sexuality – its isolation, its neediness, its lust, pride, sometime sensitivity, sometime cauterisation. He&nbsp;writes with striking perception and&nbsp;unusual honesty about his soldiers' relationships with wives, girlfriends and lap dancers, as&nbsp;well as the Iraqi girls they see (often&nbsp;through cross hairs). There's some funny stuff – a platoon all get herpes because they're using the same \"pocket pussy\". There's some brutal stuff – an anecdote in the story \"In Vietnam They Had Whores\" that I'll leave you to read. But it is interesting that the horror of war allows Klay to smuggle in an uncustomary male frankness that makes Roth, Amis and&nbsp;the gang look elliptical and effete.</p><p>The thing that impressed me most, though, was Klay's behind-the-scenes skill with language. For the most part, the stories are planed and worked in that meticulous American manner. The&nbsp;dialogue is a lesson in how to render the rhythms of natural speech. And the poetical moments arise organically – as&nbsp;when in <a href=\"http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/phil-klay-ten-kliks-south/\" title=\"\">\"Ten Kliks South\"</a> an artilleryman tells us, \"I saw&nbsp;fires through the haze, or not even&nbsp;fires, just flashes of red in the dust and&nbsp;cordite.\"</p><p>To my mind, there are three stories that are not of the highest standard – the least convincing being \"Psychological Operations\", in which the conversation long outlasts its dramatic plausibility. But <em>Redeployment</em> is a must-read for anyone with the slightest interest in the actuality of the wars that have been&nbsp;fought in our names.</p><p>• Edward Docx's <em>The Devil's Garden</em>

Not only was I an Oxford scholar, but so was my father. Moreover, my own daughters were at Oxford colleges, and my young grandchildren are educated in the city, too. So it could not be more satisfactory,\" she said.</p><p>Trollope's work will join the original manuscripts and early editions of works by her ancestor, the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope, which are held by the museum.</p><p>Trollope, whose career spans 36 years,  has been called the inventor of \"the Aga saga\" – a term she detests as patronising to her readers   – for her 18 novels of contemporary British life, including A Village Affair, The Choir and The Rector's Wife, which have often turned on family tensions in agreeable settings.</p><p>She is also the author of 10 historical novels published as Caroline Harvey, scores of short stories, non-fiction and journalism. The archive also includes recordings of interviews and radio and television programmes, as well as speeches and lectures. It covers her work with the Orange Prize, which she has chaired, and  literary bodies including the Society of Authors, the talking books section of the RNIB and the National Literacy Trust.  Trollope was awarded an OBE in  1996 for  services to literature.</p><p>Richard Ovenden, librarian at the Bodleian, said: \"Joanna Trollope's archive gives us an insight into the craft of an immensely popular writer, and a flag-bearer for fiction. Her novels, always handwritten, are meticulously researched and the collection provides an insight into this process.\"</p><p>In the digital age, the Bodleian librarians are particularly pleased to get such a wealth of handwritten material: she says much of her early work was been written on a country kitchen table, though she now writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/03/this-much-know-joanna-trollope\" title=\"\">a handsome study in her  west London home</a>.</p><p>The library will soon start cataloguing the collection to make it available to readers, and will also be exhibiting some of the material.</p><p>Ovenden added: \"Her act of generosity to the Bodleian will be appreciated by literary and cultural historians, and through displays, the public who enjoy her writing so deeply.\"</p><p>Trollope won a scholarship to study English literature  at St Hugh's, Oxford, in the 1960s.  Many authors or their heirs have sold their archives to British or overseas libraries,  and Trollope's would have considerable commercial value.  However, she has chosen to follow the example of another Oxford scholarship author,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/24/alan-bennett-oxford-university\" title=\"\"> Alan Bennett, who also donated his papers to the Bodleian</a> saying the gift was \"in gratitude to the nanny state\".</p>","headline":"Joanna Trollope donates archive to Oxford University's Bodleian Library","trailText":"<p>Best-selling novelist passes on handwritten manuscripts of her novels, as well as letters, journals and research notes</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395763138008/Joanna-Trollope-006.jpg","wordcount":"465","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T16:01:47Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/joanna-trollope-oxford-university-bodleian-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/joanna-trollope-oxford-university-bodleian-library","tags":[{"id":"books/joanna-trollope","webTitle":"Joanna Trollope","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/joanna-trollope","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/joanna-trollope","references":[]},{"id":"education/oxforduniversity","webTitle":"University of Oxford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/oxforduniversity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/oxforduniversity","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/higher-education","references":[]},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/education","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","rcsId":"GNL004696","r2ContributorId":"16031","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/maev_kennedy_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432992120","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395763130514/Joanna-Trollope-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"David Levenson","altText":"Joanna Trollope","height":"54","credit":"David Levenson/Getty Images","caption":"Joanna Trollope has been called the inventor of 'the Aga saga' – a term she detests as patronising to her readers.

And chapter books, particularly series, represent a thrilling milestone, however formulaic and tedious they may look to adult eyes. Frequently the first books an independent reader chooses for him or herself, at about age 7, they often prove the gateway to full-blown reading addiction.</p><p>Lately, there's been a crop of titles bridging the gap between picture and chapter books that I've found surprisingly appealing – illustrated throughout, often divided into sections, but longer than the picture books that are gradually consigned to the \"too babyish\" category as a child's stamina and attention span grows.</p><p>For those who can't yet read confidently alone, there's something impressive and grown-up about finishing bedtime reading at the end of a chapter, knowing the book will wait patiently, bookmark in place, for the following night. To me, the best ones offer the same intoxicating, seamless interaction between text and image that a good picture book does, with an additional sense of challenge and excitement imparted by a more sustained, developed narrative.</p><p>Clear leader of the pack is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/sep/18/review-dixie-o-day-fast-lane-shirley-hughes-clara-vulliamy\" title=\"\">Dixie O'Day: In the Fast Lane</a>, a charming collaboration between the brilliant mother-and-daughter team <a href=\"http://www.dixieoday.com/meet-shirley-and-clara/\" title=\"\">Shirley Hughes and Clara Vulliamy</a>.  In a gentle, welcoming, red-and-pink world, a Snoopy/Wacky Racers mashup seen through rose-tinted glasses, live Dixie O'Day and his diminutive pal Percy, who take great care of Dixie's beloved old car. One day, they set out to race a motley assortment of vehicles – including the shiny new convertible driven by their neighbour and nemesis, Louella, in her \"special motoring hat\" – from Didsworth to Dodsworth, having several small, self-contained adventures en route. Dixie's illustrations and words feel instantly timeless and classic – and I give in to pleas for \"just one chapter\" with the minimum of arm-twisting.</p><p>A similarly jaunty and insouciant note is struck by <a href=\"http://claudebooks.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Claude, Alex T Smith's cheerfully adventurous beret-wearing dog</a>, and his best friend Sir Bobblysock. Claude's slightly manic, wide-eyed grin as he bimbles about town unbeknown to his owners, Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes, is sure to be mirrored on the face of the reader soaking up his surreal antics.</p><p>Pip Jones's big-eyed adventures of Ava and her naughty invisible cat, <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/squishy-mcfluff-the-invisible-cat/9780571302505\" title=\"\">Squishy McFluff</a>, will also be a surefire hit with any kid who's ever devolved responsibility for wickedness or mishap to a sibling or imaginary friend. Chapter by chapter, we saunter through an elegantly depicted landscape, lulled by smooth-flowing rhyme, but gradually realising who may really be behind the book's series of dreadful deeds …</p><p>And for those who enjoy gleeful gross-outs, Tim Healey and Chris Mould provide rhyming adventures of a very different kind – the \"madcap plans and crazy ideas\" of <a href=\"https://www.hachettechildrens.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9780340997734\" title=\"\">Mortimer Keene</a>, a juvenile inventor and slime-flooder of schools whose brain has been overheated by an excess of homework.

From his mid-teens until almost the end of his life, he kept, with one short break, a daily diary of the events he took part in, the people he met and the thoughts that ran through his mind. The full archive runs to an estimated 20m words. The published diaries, extracted by his devoted editor&nbsp;Ruth Winstone, fill 11 volumes. Winstone also edited a brief but revealing memoir of his early life and&nbsp;family.</p><p>What do these publications – a&nbsp;small&nbsp;fraction of the total archive – tell&nbsp;us about Benn and the influences that shaped his political career? In particular, what do they tell us about his ambitions and his failure to attain, as many expected and some hoped, the leadership of the Labour party and, by&nbsp;extension, the prime ministership? How badly did he want to reach the top?</p><p>It is almost immediately apparent from the diaries and memoir that, for him, only two things mattered in life: politics and family. He adored his American wife, Caroline, to whom he was married for more than 50 years, and grieved for her every day after her&nbsp;death from cancer in 2000. He delighted in his four children and later&nbsp;in his grandchildren. Though he frequently regretted that, for many years, he put politics first and didn't give his wife and children enough of his time and emotional energy, there was no real conflict between the two. It&nbsp;was a political household. Caroline was a firm socialist before she married him and knew she was marrying into politics as surely as Kate Middleton knew&nbsp;she was marrying into royalty.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432719400'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395321352486/Tony-Benn-family-009.jpg' alt='Tony Benn family' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Benn with his wife, Caroline and children Joshua and Melissa. Photograph: Daily Mail /Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>Benn's paternal grandfather was a Liberal MP, initially elected for an east London constituency in 1892, and later became chairman of the London County Council. His maternal great-grandfather served on Paisley council, while his maternal grandfather was elected a Liberal MP in Glasgow in 1911. Benn's father, William Wedgwood Benn, became a Liberal MP in 1906, and a Liberal minister in 1910, but left&nbsp;office during the first world war, enlisting in the Middlesex Yeomanry even though both his age (37) and his membership of the Commons would have exempted him from military service. He served throughout the war,&nbsp;fighting at Gallipoli and twice refusing offers to rejoin the government. Having long been on the radical wing&nbsp;of the Liberals, he then crossed the floor to join Labour in 1927, but immediately resigned his seat because, his son wrote, \"his constituents had elected him as Liberal and he thought it immoral to remain as a Labour MP\". He&nbsp;returned after a byelection the following year and went on to become&nbsp;a minister. Remarkably, he&nbsp;enlisted again in the second world&nbsp;war.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;a&nbsp;daunting example&nbsp;to follow.</p><p>Nonconformist religion also ran through the Benn line and, to the collective family mind, there was no real distinction from politics; they were just different forms of service to others. His paternal great-grandfather Julius Benn was a minister in the Congregationalist church, where each congregation makes its own decision about its affairs, including the election of a minister, without reference to higher authority. His grandfather and father, though \"in no sense pious\" according to Benn, remained in the dissenting tradition. His mother, too, became a Congregationalist in 1949 when she left the Anglican church because of its failure to allow the ordination of women. His much-loved elder brother, Michael, intended to become a church minister before he was killed flying an RAF plane in the second world war.</p><p>As was often the case with non-conformist families of that era, there was room for little in life except work which, in William Wedgwood Benn's household, largely meant politics. Neither time nor money was to be wasted. As a child, Tony Benn was required to keep an account book showing how he spent his pocket money each week and then have it audited by his father's secretary before he received more. He was also required to keep a time chart, as his father did. His father's chart, the son recalled, contained no time for meals, conversation or any social life.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432719401'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395321422016/Tony-Benn-on-the-May-Day--009.jpg' alt='Tony Benn on the May Day rally' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tony Benn on the May Day rally. Photograph: Thomas B Claydon</figcaption></figure><p>One chapter of Benn's childhood memoir was headed \"How I Became a Philistine\". \"No attempt,\" he wrote, \"was made to develop the artistic, musical and literary side of life.\" The family's London home was next door to the Tate Gallery, but he never visited it, nor could he recall being taken to the theatre more than once or twice. The family never went on holiday except to a holiday home at Stansgate in Essex, which was not, as newspapers often implied, an ancient castle or mansion but a prefabricated house bought by his grandfather for £600. Even reading wasn't particularly encouraged. \"I was never a great reader at school,\" he wrote, \"and I cannot remember many books being read to me as a child.\" He had \"lived in the oral tradition, learning from listening and watching rather than from reading, and communicating by speaking rather than writing\".</p><p>\"What moves me?\" he once said to&nbsp;his fellow MP John Reid. \"It isn't bloody books. I hardly ever read them.\" He never developed an interest in fiction. \"I don't know much about <em>Great Expectations</em> or Dickens,\" his diary records in 1999. His diaries reveal&nbsp;even more startling gaps in the&nbsp;knowledge of a leading politician with&nbsp;an Oxford PPE degree. In 1973, he asked a fellow Labour MP and former university lecturer to give him tutorials on the English revolution. He was astonished to learn about the Levellers and how they had \"called for universal manhood suffrage\". He had not read <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> or anything else by Marx or Engels until his wife put it in his stocking for Christmas 1976. \"I feel so ignorant,\" he confided to his diary, \"that at the age of 51 as a&nbsp;socialist politician … I should never have read that basic text before and I am shy to admit it.\" Only when he had read and pondered on these and other texts did his political direction become clear to himself and others.</p><p>His upbringing gave Benn, at least by the standards of the upper-middle-class to which he belonged, an unusually limited outlook, comparable to Margaret Thatcher's, whom he resembled in other surprising ways. His diaries contain few significant references to music, theatre or art. He&nbsp;rarely watched TV until his later years and, though he had some interest&nbsp;in film, his tastes were largely middlebrow: \"I like happy endings,\" he wrote. Nor did he have much interest in sport, architecture, food (taken to a posh Notting Hill restaurant, he merely records that one course was equivalent to a pensioner's weekly income), drink (he was a teetotaller), clothes (Caroline bought them for him) or the natural world. He only occasionally attended parties or dinners. Yet he was assiduous in attending political rallies and meetings across the country – they&nbsp;occupied most weekends – and he never missed the Durham miners' gala where, he confessed, he always wept. He continued the family tradition of taking holidays at Stansgate, the only exceptions being visits to his in-laws in&nbsp;Cincinnati, where, on one occasion, he spent the \"holiday\" campaigning in&nbsp;a US byelection.</p><p>Benn admitted his narrow range of&nbsp;interests and limited reading were \"a&nbsp;serious disadvantage\", but did not elaborate on how. Perhaps he thought his lack of a hinterland made it hard for&nbsp;him to switch off and get some perspective on events and on his career. He is less likely to have understood that his single-minded focus helped to create the slightly deranged, obsessive air of a fanatic which, however removed from the truth, was skilfully exploited by his opponents to damage his political career. Equally, though, his lack of the&nbsp;cultural baggage carried by many politicians of his class made it easier for him, at least in his own mind, to talk on equal terms with working-class people. After all, their traditional culture, too, was largely oral.</p><p>There was another aspect of Benn that did far more to prevent him becoming leader, and it was something which few contemporaries, least of all journalists, fully understood: the driving force of his life was Christian socialism. He stood in a high-minded tradition that went back to Keir Hardie, co-founder of the Labour party, George Lansbury, its leader in the early 1930s, and the historian RH Tawney, its most important intellectual influence in the early 20th century. It went still further back to Victorian figures such as Thomas Hughes, author of <em>Tom Brown's Schooldays</em>, and Charles Kingsley, author of <em>The Water Babies</em>, and even to the Old Testament. \"For Benn,\" David Powell, an early biographer wrote, \"the entire socialist venture is rooted in history, a continuum reaching back in time to its biblical roots\".</p><p>As we have seen, dissenting religion was deeply embedded in the Benn family history. His mother read him Bible stories – struggles between Old Testament kings and prophets in which the Benns were naturally on the side of the latter – and at nights they prayed together. At Westminster school, divinity was his best subject. The young Benn went to church \"and took very seriously the obligations of Holy Communion after I was confirmed\". When his brother died, he recorded in his diary at that time, he prayed in the station chapel (he had also joined the RAF) \"where before and beside God … I&nbsp;began the task of pulling together the&nbsp;shattered fabric of love and companionship\". When, aged 25, he&nbsp;stood successfully in 1950 for the Bristol seat previously held by Stafford Cripps, the former Labour chancellor wrote to the electorate that Benn was \"as keen a Christian as I am myself\".</p><p>He drifted away from religion but not from Christian principles. In his memoir, he wrote: \"I certainly was not influenced by atheistic arguments, which were extreme and threw doubt on the value of the Bible and the historical truth of Jesus's life.\" He&nbsp;specifically rejected the label \"humanist\", saying in 2005 \"I'm a&nbsp;Christian agnostic … I believe in Jesus&nbsp;the prophet, not Christ the king.\" He objected to how the established churches used power structures to&nbsp;build their own authority and particularly to the doctrine of original sin, which was \"destructive of any hope that we might succeed together in building a better world\".</p><p>On the walls of his office, he hung a Salvation Army hymn that had been sung to him by his parents:</p><p>Standing by a purpose true,</p><p>Heeding God's command,</p><p>Honour them, the faithful few!</p><p>All hail to Daniel's band!</p><p>Dare to be a Daniel,</p><p>Dare to stand alone!</p><p>Dare to have a purpose firm!</p><p>Dare to make it known.</p><p><em>Dare to be a Daniel</em> was the title chosen by Benn for his early life memoir. According to the Biblical story, Daniel braved and survived a night in a&nbsp;den of lions rather than renounce his faith. This sense that one must remain true to one's faith and bear witness whatever the odds is the key to understanding Benn's political career, its failures as well as its successes. The lesson he took from his upbringing – and particularly from his father, whom he adored and admired –&nbsp;was that he must always do and say what was right, regardless of whether or not it left him alone in the world. David Runciman's argument, in his book <em>Political Hypocrisy</em>, that \"liberal democratic politics are only sustainable if mixed with a certain amount of dissimulation and pretence\" would have been incomprehensible to Benn.</p><p>What is striking from the Benn diaries is how readily he turned against colleagues, particularly party leaders, even when they should have been natural allies. As his biographer Jad&nbsp;Adams put it, he was \"loyal to principles in politics, not people\". The&nbsp;compromises of power were not&nbsp;for him; he \"would not bend his principles,\" wrote Adams, \"for the power brokers in the Labour party, nor&nbsp;for the media, nor even for the electorate\". Though he was as ambitious as most politicians, he was incapable of making the necessary alliances and therefore failed not only to become prime minister – as many at Westminster, not least Harold Wilson, expected him to do – but even to hold&nbsp;one of the great offices of state: chancellor, home secretary or foreign&nbsp;secretary.</p><p>The most bitter feuds of Benn's life,&nbsp;where his diary entries take on an&nbsp;edge of personal hostility lacking in his&nbsp;comments on other Labour figures, were with Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock who should have been (and, in&nbsp;Foot's case, was at one stage) allies on&nbsp;the left.</p><p>After Wilson's resignation in 1976, Benn stood as a leadership candidate. In the first ballot, he got 37 votes to Foot's 90. He then stood aside in favour of the latter. In that same year, Foot introduced him at a miners' gala as a future prime minister.</p><p>By 1977, however, when Benn was holding unauthorised meetings of junior ministers to discuss a bill for elections to the European parliament, Foot was accusing him of being \"bloody crooked\". Foot later apologised but Benn wrote in his diary that \"my links with him are severed completely\". Though Benn voted for Foot in the 1980 leadership election, and didn't stand against him, their relationship worsened still further. \"Michael Foot is hopeless,\" he confided to his diary and their relations reached a new low when Benn chose in 1981 to stand against Denis Healey for the deputy leadership. As late as 2002, the two men were exchanging insults over the telephone about Benn having his diaries serialised in the Daily Mail. \"I thought, bloody hell, that man joined in the witch-hunt of the left, with the full support of all the right-wing papers,\" Benn recorded.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432719402'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395321490147/Tony-Benn-tea-009.jpg' alt='Tony Benn tea' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Andy Butterton/PA</figcaption></figure><p>As Kinnock emerged as a young rival&nbsp;on the left, Benn's diaries reveal withering contempt. Kinnock was \"not&nbsp;a substantial person … a media figure really\", Benn recorded in 1976. The effect of his leadership, he noted in 1992, was to destroy the Labour party \"financially, as well as politically, morally&nbsp;and intellectually and organisationally\". During that year's election campaign, he viewed him as \"grinning and arrogant, and strident and raucous\". After Kinnock left the leadership in the wake of the election defeat, Benn recorded: \"I really thank God that man was never Prime Minister.\" His hostility to Kinnock made him, if only briefly, sympathetic to Tony Blair when Blair succeeded to the leadership. \"I must not get into the&nbsp;business of being seen as critical of&nbsp;the new Leader,\" he told his diary.</p><p>His relations with political opposites, by contrast, were often extraordinarily intimate and cordial. He was, for example, a long-standing friend of Enoch Powell, reassuring him&nbsp;in 1959 – Powell had resigned as chief secretary to the treasury the previous year over plans for increased public spending – that \"his sheer ability&nbsp;and lucidity would carry him upwards\". Benn's initial reaction to Powell's \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968, as recorded in his diaries, was not&nbsp;so much to condemn as to observe that Powell was of \"working-class origins\" and had \"never been accepted in the Tory Party\". Another opponent for whom Benn, a Sinn Féin supporter, had a soft spot was Ian Paisley. He described him in 1997 as \"a very nice guy … a good constituency Member … [with] a good class sense … an amusing&nbsp;guy\". He found Norman Tebbit \"terribly soft and good-natured\" and \"really a rather decent guy\". John Major was \"such a nice guy\", a victim of \"the Establishment\" which mocked him \"to prove to itself that it was right to transfer its loyalty from the Tory Party to New Labour\". Benn was \"rather fond\" of Edward Heath, with whom he shared views about Blair's foreign policy. \"I greatly value my friendship with you,\" he told him in 1998.</p><p>Benn liked, even admired, such&nbsp;men&nbsp;because they came from humble&nbsp;backgrounds and could be categorised&nbsp;as victims of the dreaded \"Establishment\". They had not tried to&nbsp;dissemble or smooth out their rough&nbsp;edges in order to make themselves more popular or acceptable. Benn empathised with their \"outsider\" status, even if it was acquired after they held high office. Reflecting in&nbsp;1994&nbsp;on the growing distance between&nbsp;himself and Labour&nbsp;colleagues, he recorded that \"I&nbsp;remind&nbsp;myself of Enoch Powell in&nbsp;his&nbsp;latter days.\" After&nbsp;receiving \"a&nbsp;sweet letter\" from Paisley in 2008, he&nbsp;recorded that \"he has openly and honestly argued in favour of what he believed to be the interests of those he represented\" and \"in politics, I think you have to say what you mean and mean what you say, and&nbsp;I think Ian did&nbsp;that\".</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-432064566\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/14/101101TonyB-4x3.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/14/101101TonyB_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/14//101101TonyB.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/14/101101TonyB_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/14/101101TonyB/101101TonyB.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>But what did Benn mean? Where did&nbsp;he stand? The answer now seems obvious but it wasn't always so. On his 23rd birthday in 1948, he was asking in his diary: \"Is politics really my place? … Just where do I stand politically? Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;a socialist? … Am I insincere?\" Benn was often accused of careerism – initially climbing the ministerial ladder from a conventional centrist position and then switching to the left when it&nbsp;seemed to offer the best chance of becoming leader – but his diaries give little evidence of such calculations. As&nbsp;early as 1958, he resigned from the Labour frontbench as No 2 spokesman on defence because party policy then favoured the H-bomb \"and I could not&nbsp;conscientiously be the spokesman of a&nbsp;policy with which I was in disagreement\". Cynics may say that Benn wanted to ride the unilateralist tide which was then flowing strongly but, in 1960, he tried to make peace between the party's warring factions, only to find himself being treated with angry distrust both by Hugh Gaitskell, the pro-bomb party leader, and Frank Cousins, the anti-bomb union leader. When Labour's national executive, to&nbsp;which he had been elected the previous year, rejected his peace proposals, he resigned. Hardly anybody, not even Caroline, thought&nbsp;he had done the right thing.</p><p>He did not use the resignation device again. When Wilson moved him in 1975 from the industry department to energy – in effect, a demotion, carried out, it was widely assumed, at&nbsp;the behest of the City – he decided \"there was no principle in resigning over being given a different cabinet job\". Moreover, as he told colleagues a&nbsp;year later, the Movement (for Benn, it&nbsp;always had a capital M) wanted the policies changed, not the government or its leading members, to whom it demanded loyalty. \"I mustn't bring the government down,\" he later told his diary in the wake of public spending cuts, \"because if I do the responsibility will be put upon the left.\"</p><p>By then, with what he called \"my education\" considerably advanced, thanks to his discovery of the Levellers, he knew where he stood. There had been a lost decade in his political development. At the beginning of the 1960s, still in his mid‑30s, he seemed genuinely unsure about which way he should move, just as he had been 12 years earlier. There followed three years in which he campaigned to have the law changed so that he could renounce the peerage&nbsp;he had inherited from his father, who&nbsp;died in 1960, and retain his&nbsp;Commons seat. When that project ended successfully, a general election campaign was close. Ministerial office, in what were essentially technocratic positions beyond the frontline of partisan politics (postmaster-general and minister of technology) occupied the rest of the decade.</p><p>In 1970, after Labour lost power, he&nbsp;was eagerly speculating about his leadership chances: \"If I am going to make any sort of bid … I shall have to begin soon\". He stood unsuccessfully for the deputy leadership in 1971. But he then embarked on his belated education in which he read more widely. He resolved, reflecting on Wilson's sad example, that if he was to become leader, he should stand for something that was clear and constant. When he returned to government at the industry department in 1974, he told his permanent secretary that \"my&nbsp;work as manager or a minister is nothing like as important as my work as an educator and spokesman\". In&nbsp;1977, Frances Morrell, his special adviser, told him that the only thing worth his doing was to become party leader. \"I said there was another choice, to influence the Party, and she said there was no real influence except as Leader. But I've seen so many lives wrecked by ambition and I don't intend to do that.\" Though he stood twice for the leadership and once more for the deputy leadership, he did so, not so much in hope or expectation of victory (his diaries show that, in his 1981 conference contest with Healey for the deputy leadership, he saw a chance of victory only on the eve of the conference) as with the intention of giving a higher profile to the policies he&nbsp;so passionately favoured.</p><p>At least that was what he told himself. But there were regrets. \"I suppose I should have played my cards differently,\" he mused after he had lost his Bristol seat in 1983, and found himself out of parliament during the contest for Foot's successor. In 1991, after re-reading his earlier diaries in advance of publication, he reflected: \"All that time wasted on Militant when&nbsp;they really aren't a part of the normal mainstream of the LP … On the&nbsp;one hand, you have got all these people who are simply concerned with&nbsp;power; and on the other, you've&nbsp;got sectarians who are simply concerned with ideological purity; and somewhere in the middle somebody has to try … to bring it all together for the good of the people we represent\".</p><p>That same year, Geoffrey Goodman, a veteran Daily Mirror journalist, discussed with Benn why, as Goodman put it, \"you threw it all away\" and never became leader. \"A bit of compromising,\" said Goodman, \"and you would have got there and it would have made a difference.\" Benn wife's Caroline and the academic (and father of the present Labour leader) Ralph Miliband, one of his closest friends, would agree, Benn reflected. But if he had become leader, he would have done so \"on what I called Kinnock's terms\", presenting a programme to modify and perhaps jettison some of the party's most fundamental principles. \"I wasn't&nbsp;prepared to settle for that.\"</p><p>No whiff of financial or sexual scandal ever touched Tony Benn, despite journalists' best efforts. He was, to be sure, accused of political ruthlessness and manipulation and,&nbsp;in&nbsp;the early 80s, of tolerating intimidation among his extra-parliamentary supporters, a subject on&nbsp;which the diaries of the time betray not the slightest sign of concern or even awareness (only much later did he recognise Militant as \"an impossible crowd of people\"). But as Jad Adams put it, perhaps a little incongruously, he \"preserved the Benn brand\", which Adams described as \"old-fashioned, even Victorian values, of earnestness, integrity and hard work\". What Benn never grasped was the mindset of those who cared more than he did about life beyond politics: houses, cars,&nbsp;holidays, good food. Because, as Adams observed, avarice was not part of his own make-up – partly because modest family funds from both sides of&nbsp;the marriage helped him and his wife to live comfortably if far from extravagantly – he failed to recognise its importance as a motivation for others. Even his political interests were&nbsp;oddly narrow. On education and health, for example, he had little to say&nbsp;beyond calls for more funds. \"What&nbsp;do&nbsp;you do?\" was his usual question to&nbsp;anyone he met for the first&nbsp;time. He frequently recorded the&nbsp;answers in his diaries. He did not record what they said about their hopes for their future, their ambitions for their children or how politicians could help them. Did he even ask?</p><p>His career was, by normal standards, a failure. He held only four ministerial positions, the most senior of them (secretary of state for industry) for just&nbsp;a year. By the time he held that post, he had completed his strangely belated political education and worked&nbsp;out what he believed and wanted to&nbsp;achieve. He moved not to&nbsp;the premiership but to a life as a teacher, preacher and prophet, which he pursued, despite the frailities of old&nbsp;age and chronic illness, until almost the end of his life. He remained&nbsp;true to Jesus but never quite resolved, in his own mind, whether this outcome amounted to success or failure.</p><p><em>Years of Hope: Diaries, Papers and Letters 1940‑1962</em> (Arrow), <em>Out of the Wilderness, Diaries 1963-7</em> (Arrow), <em>Office without Power, Diaries 1968-72</em> (Arrow), <em>Against the Tide, Diaries 1973-6 </em>(Arrow), <em>Conflicts of Interest</em>, Diaries <em>1977-80</em> (Arrow), <em>The&nbsp;End of an Era, Diaries 1980-90</em> (Arrow).</p>","headline":"Tony Benn: Peter Wilby reads the diaries","trailText":"<p>Tony Benn left behind 11 volumes of his diaries.

brilliantly allusive moral tale of youth, beauty and corruption was greeted with howls of protest on publication <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/22/100-best-novels-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">Robert McCrum introduces the series</a>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Of all the books in this series, Oscar Wilde's only novel enjoyed by far the worst reception on its publication. The reviews were dreadful, the sales poor, and it was not until many years after Wilde's death that this remarkable work of imagination was recognised as a classic.</p><p>Its gestation was troubled, too. First commissioned in the summer of 1889 by an American editor for <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>, Wilde initially submitted a fairy tale \"The Fisherman and his Soul\", which was rejected. Eventually, his typescript for <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> was delivered in April 1890, whereupon <em>Lippincott's </em>editor declared that \"in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to\".</p><p>In the light of several subsequent reviews, this was a comparatively mild critique. Wilde himself was steadfast in defending his author's vision. He always maintained that the Faustian idea of Dorian Gray, \"the idea of a young man selling his soul in exchange for eternal youth\", was \"old in the history of literature\". But when he gave an archetypal story a striking contemporary spin, with strong homoerotic undertones, he stirred up a furore of hostility.</p><p>Reread today, however, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> is a wonderfully entertaining parable of the aesthetic ideal (art for art's sake), and a sneak preview of the brilliance exhibited in plays such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NFQbeE9gkQ\" title=\"\"><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></a> and <em>Lady Windermere's Fan</em>. What began as an outré, decadent novella, now seems more like an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic, than the depraved fiction alleged by his outraged critics.</p><p>Dorian Gray is the impossibly beautiful young man who becomes the subject of a portrait by the fashionable society painter, Basil Hallward. When the artist, who has become infatuated with his model, introduces the \"young Adonis\" to Lord Henry Wotton, he is rapidly seduced by the peer's witty and corrupting devotion to <em>fin-de-siècle</em> hedonism, some of it inspired by Wilde's own experience.</p><p>Among the influences that shaped the book, I would argue that Disraeli (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels\" title=\"\">No 11 in this series</a>) is a ghostly godfather to the novel. Wilde tips his hat not only to Disraeli's <em>Sybil</em>, but also to <em>Vivian Grey</em>, his first novel. Closer to his own time, Wilde also took inspiration from Robert Louis Stevenson and <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>. There was something about the literary alter ego that held a peculiar fascination for late Victorians.</p><p>Under the malign influence of Lord Henry – \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it\", is one of many Wildean epigrams scattered through the text – Dorian Gray plunges into a decadent and sinister milieu, becoming a slave to drugs and debauchery. His fatal love affair with the actress Sybil Vane alerts him to the secret of his eternal youth: he will remain untarnished while his portrait reflects the hideous corruption of his soul.</p><p>Eventually despairing, the young man blames the artist Hallward for his fate, and murders him. But Dorian Gray can never \"be at peace\". Finally, in a horrifying climax, he takes a knife to his own portrait. When his servants find him, the picture depicts their youthful master as they had once known him. The corpse next to it is as \"withered, wrinkled and loathsome of visage\" as the portrait had been. Art and life are back in harmony, as Wilde intended, and his brilliantly allusive moral tale is complete.</p><p>When the magazine version of <em>Dorian Gray</em> was published, there were howls of protest. Some reviewers declared that, far from exposing immorality, Wilde wanted to promote it. Elsewhere, the story was greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend his novel in letters to the press. One reviewer for a newspaper which declared that <em>Lippincott's</em> should be \"ashamed to circulate\" such filth, refused to describe the contents of the novel because he did not wish to \"advertise the developments of an esoteric prurience\".</p><p>As well as talk of prosecution, there was a strong hint of Francophobia against the decadent \"yellow book\" Lord Henry gives Dorian to recruit him to his belief in \"Art\". The <em>Daily Chronicle</em> found the novel to be \"a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French decadents\". More dangerous were the attempts of some reviewers to link the novel to the Cleveland Street affair of 1889. This scandal, centred on a male brothel frequented by an upper-class clientele that included members of the British political elite, was an eerie forerunner, in its exposure of the demi-monde, of the Queensberry libel case that would eventually destroy Wilde in 1895.</p><h2>A note on the text</h2><p><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Wilde's only novel, was published on 20 June 1890 in the July edition of <em>Lippincott's</em>, as a novella of 13 chapters, and was the leading contribution to the magazine. Several British reviewers condemned the book for immorality. The novel became so controversial that WH Smith withdrew that month's edition of <em>Lippincott's</em> from its railway station bookstalls.</p><p>In fact, the magazine's editors, fearful of charges of \"indecency\" had already cut some 500 words, without Wilde's knowledge, before publication. Deletions to Wilde's typescript included the elimination of several passages alluding to homosexual desire, and the deletion of three references to Gray's female lovers Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton as his \"mistresses\". Wilde, it must be said, conducted himself during this campaign, with impressive dignity and composure.</p><p>Later, Wilde himself further revised the story for book publication, making significant alterations, cutting the most controversial passages, adding new chapters, and including a preface that has since become famous in its own right as his defence of art for art's sake. The amended version, extended from 13 to 20 chapters, was published in a single volume by Ward Lock &amp; Co, in April 1891. This is now the standard version of the text.</p><h2>Other essential Wilde titles</h2><p><em>The Picture of Mr WH</em> (1889); <em>The Happy Prince &amp; Other Tales</em> (1888); <em>De Profundis</em> (1897).</p>","headline":"The 100 best novels: No 27 – The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1891)","trailText":"<p>Wilde's brilliantly allusive moral tale of youth, beauty and corruption was greeted with howls of protest on publication, writes <strong>Robert McCrum</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395080455080/100-best-novels-dorian-004.jpg","wordcount":"996","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-13T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde","tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[]},{"id":"culture/oscar-wilde","webTitle":"Oscar Wilde","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/oscar-wilde","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","rcsId":"GNL042186","r2ContributorId":"15288","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/robert_mccrum_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/apr/01/fiction.petercarey\" title=\"\">Oscar and Lucinda</a>. Now the acclaimed Australian author is set to address a rather more modern situation in his new novel, Amnesia: the \"cyber underworld\", with a story of a hacker who unlocks the doors of thousands of prisons across Australia and the US.</p><p>Due out in November, Amnesia was announced by publisher Faber this morning. Opening in 2010 – \"It was a spring evening in Washington DC; a chilly autumn morning in Melbourne; it was exactly 22.00 Greenwich Mean Time\" – it sees a worm sent into the computerised control systems of hundreds of Australian prisons by a young Australian hacker. The worm goes on to infect jails across America, \"because Australian prison security was, in the year 2010, mostly designed and sold by American corporations\".</p><p>\"Wherever it went, it travelled underground, in darkness, like a bushfire burning in the roots of trees. Reaching its destinations it announced itself: THE CORPORATION IS UNDER OUR CONTROL. THE ANGEL DECLARES YOU FREE,\" writes Carey as the novel opens.</p><p>\"Has a young Australian woman declared cyber war on the United States? Or was her Angel Worm intended only to open the prison doors of those unfortunates detained by Australia's harsh immigration policies? Did America suffer collateral damage?  Is she innocent?  Can she be saved?\" asked the publisher as it unveiled the novel, adding that Carey's books have sold more than one million copies in the UK alone.</p><p>Editor Angus Cargill called Amnesia \"a thrilling and witty journey to the place where the cyber underworld of radicals and hackers collides with international power politics\", and said it \"could not be more timely\".</p><p>Carey's Booker-winning novels take place in more distant times: Oscar and Lucinda is set in 1864, as Oxford seminarian Oscar Hopkins meets Sydney heiress Lucinda Leplastrier on the boat to Australia. True History of the Kelly Gang, meanwhile, allows the outlaw Ned Kelly, hung in 1880, to speak for himself: \"I lost my own father at 12 yrs of age and know what it is to be raised on lies and silences my dear daughter you are presently too young to understand a word I write but this history is for you and will contain no single lie may I burn in hell if I speak false.\"</p><p>Carey has set books in current times: his most recent novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/chemistry-tears-peter-carey-review\" title=\"\">The Chemistry of Tears</a>, takes place in London 2010 – with a back story in 1850s Germany – while His Illegal Self also has a modern setting. The author is best known for weaving history into his fiction, however, from his retelling of Great Expectations, Jack Maggs, to Parrot and Olivier in America, in which a French aristocrat sets sail for the New World.</p>","headline":"Peter Carey to tackle computer hacking and international politics in new novel","trailText":"<p>Booker prize-winner will turn his sights towards the 'cyber underworld' and hacktivism in Amnesia, out in November</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395764577282/Peter-Carey-003.jpg","wordcount":"466","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-25T15:15:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/peter-carey-hacking-cyber-underworld-new-novel-amnesia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/peter-carey-hacking-cyber-underworld-new-novel-amnesia","tags":[{"id":"books/petercarey","webTitle":"Peter Carey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/petercarey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/petercarey","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/hacking","webTitle":"Hacking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/hacking","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432962714","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395764574034/Peter-Carey-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","photographer":"Flora Hanitijo","altText":"Peter Carey","height":"54","credit":"Flora Hanitijo/PR","caption":"'Could not be more timely' … Peter Carey.

Award-winning writer Jeff VanderMeer will be joining us this Friday to discuss this topic and more","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Philip K Dick's Ubik has definitely given us plenty to talk about on this month's reading group. Teasing out this book's many strands, influences and implications has been fascinating – and bewildering. What does it all mean? I'm still not sure. Maybe nothing, if you believe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ATalkWithPhilipK.DickOnHour25In1976\" title=\"\">what the author said</a> in 1976:</p><blockquote><p>\"You don't just write whatever comes into your head while you're sitting there in front of the typewriter. When I wrote UBIK, I got about 12 pages done and couldn't think of anything else, so l just wrote whatever came into my mind. I wrote it from my unconscious: I let the right hemisphere of my brain do all the thinking, and I was as surprised as anybody as to what came out. In France, of course, it's considered a great novel because it doesn't make any sense; in France, it's a r<em>oman de pataphysique</em>.\"</p></blockquote><p>Darn it! But the fact that all that complication and drama in Ubik may not add up to anything also enables it to add up to everything. It is a novel of infinite possibility. It's a bravura display of narrative uncertainty. And Dick is a master at holding his readers' attention while everything falls apart.</p><p>All of which makes me very pleased to announce that we're going to be joined by Jeff VanderMeer at 1pm on Friday 28 March for this month's live webchat. Anyone who has read VanderMeer's award-winning fiction – and especially his latest novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/05/annihilation-review-jeff-vandermeer-afraid-turn-page\" title=\"\">Annihilation</a> - will be aware that this writer also knows a thing or two about keeping his readers guessing. And since definite answers about Ubik are so hard to come by, it seems a good idea to alter our usual formula slightly and question someone who has an affinity for Dick's kind of writing as well as expertise on the author's life and times.</p><p>Annihilation is full of the unease and mystery that make Dick's books so fascinating – and notably, in fine Philip K Dick style – it was <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lincolnmichel/jeff-vandermeer\" title=\"\">inspired by a dream</a>.  Judging by the buzz about the book, and the reviews its been getting, that was an excellent night's work.</p><p>I'm sure it's going to be intriguing to hear about the creation of this work, not to mention VanderMeer's influences, what he thinks of Dick himself and his opinions on the history of this kind of speculative fiction. Although we have invited Jeff primarily as a creative artist, it's also worth noting that he's no slouch on this latter subject, having co-edited a number of highly respected SF anthologies such as <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2011/08/30/table-of-contents-the-weird-edited-by-ann-and-jeff-vandermeer/\" title=\"\">The Weird</a>. While I'm noting his qualifications, I should also say that he is the winner of two World Fantasy awards as well as a finalist for the Hugo awards and significantly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick_Award\" title=\"\">the Philip K Dick award</a>. (He has also chaired the panel of judges for the latter.)</p><p>But really, I don't need to say much more to introduce Jeff VanderMeer because his words speak for themselves. You can <a href=\"http://io9.com/read-the-mesmerizing-first-chapter-of-jeff-vandermeers-1520682658\" title=\"\">read the first chapter of Annihilation here</a>. Better still, we have copies to give away to the first 10 people to post a relevant question, alongside \"I want a copy please\". And if you're lucky enough to get your request in quickly, don't forget to email <a href=\"mailto:laura.kemp@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">laura.kemp@theguardian.com</a> (Ginny is away for a couple of months) as we can't track you down ourselves – and don't forget to be nice!</p><p>Jeff will be here at 1pm on Friday – but please feel free to get your questions in early, and post now if you don't think you can make the allotted time.

savage realities of modern-day Delhi will not be changing any time soon, says Rana Dasgupta in this powerful study","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>In the final pages of this intense, lyrical, erudite and powerful book, <a href=\"http://www.ranadasgupta.com/\" title=\"\">Rana Dasgupta</a> makes the most important of many perceptive points: there is no certainty, indeed little probability, that the city will eventually find the relative calm, order and hygiene of its counterparts in the developed world. There is no obvious reason why the evolution of this crowded, traumatised, violent metropolis in India in the early decades of the 21st century should follow that of New York, London or Paris in another place and another time. Delhi will remain as it is.</p><p>Judging by the content of the previous pages, this is a frightening prospect. Dasgupta has provided a welcome corrective to the reams of superficial travel writing describing the whimsical, the exotic, the booming or simply the poverty-stricken in India. His is a much more complex, darker story and it is no surprise that his book is peopled by the corrupt, the tragic and the terrified.</p><p>Dasgupta was born and raised in the UK and his work thus fits in a long tradition of nonfiction writing on India by outsiders who are also insiders. The idea to take Delhi, and more particularly its new \"bourgeoisie\", as a subject is a very good one. Through an unflinching portrayal of the arrogant, aggressive, ultra-materialistic new wealthy in the Indian capital he makes broad points about India a generation after the major wave of economic reform which unleashed a savage capitalism in the country.</p><p>\"If I do something, I do it for myself, I do it for my family and I do it for my friends… For nobody else,\" says one interviewee, a hugely rich industrialist. Another, the troubled and driven scion of a big business dynasty, talks of the \"contempt\" he thinks he would feel for the workforce, who toil on the construction sites which make his family's fortune. He \"thinks he would feel\" because he has not actually viewed their prison-like accommodation, with its filth, disease, danger and overcrowding. To these people, and many others like them, the poor are invisible, airbrushed out of reality.</p><p>But the book is more than a critique of global capitalism and India's version of it. After all, Dasgupta's talents are as&nbsp;a writer, a chronicler and an observer, not an economist. It is an investigation of the essential violence which underpins all relations in the city, that is the essence of the place.</p><p>Dasgupta traces this back to the destruction in 1947 of the erudite, spiritual, syncretic civilisation that united Muslims and Hindus in the city. There are many earlier traumatic events too – the razing of the city by a series of conquerors over a millennium – but it is the massive violence that accompanied the partition of British India, the exodus of so many Muslims, the influx of huge numbers of scared, stunned, bitter refugees from the Punjab, which defined Delhi's dark soul. This marks, Dasgupta writes, \"the birth of what can be recognised as contemporary Delhi culture. This is why the city seems so emotionally broken… so threatening… The residual trauma, like DDT in the food chain, became more concentrated with time.\" Delhi's obsession with money, property, power and outward display is the \"diametric opposite\" of the detached, spiritual outlook of the city's wealthy before 1947, Dasgupta says. Here, instead of meaning a celebration of community, the word \"communal\" indicates sectarian conflict.</p><p>The emasculation experienced by northern Indian men during partition, when women were subjected to atrocious violence, plays its role in explaining another significant feature of modern Delhi. In one of the bleakest passages in this bleak book, Dasgupta talks of the \"low-level, but widespread, war against women whose new mobility made them not only the icons of India's social and economic changes but also the scapegoats\". Independent women threaten a deeply fragile masculine identity and are punished, often publicly, as a result.</p><p>The gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a bus on Delhi's streets in December 2012 marked an inflection point in the general narrative overseas about the city. The attention it attracted was due in large part to the previous perception of the city as the capital of a country that was \"emerging\", a process which in the west is seen as a uniform and smooth ascent of hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>But change generates enormous tensions which often lead to great violence. This is true right across south Asia. If major conflicts alive at the end of the last century such as those in Nepal, Kashmir or Sri Lanka have cooled, many others, at a lower level, have sprung up. These include anti-Muslim attacks in Myanmar, gang wars in the tiny island nation of the Maldives, the lethal street politics of Bangladesh, the criminals who kill in Pakistan's Karachi, Islamic extremist groups on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, conflicts over land, water, mineral resources, caste and, increasingly, values in India. This is certainly an emerging region in economic terms. But it is also an extremely violent one. This does not contradict the growth story, but it is an inherent part of it.</p><p>Dasgupta's unstated but apparent nostalgia for rural life – a feature of many critiques of the urban from both left and right wing – sometimes jars. There is nothing particularly bucolic about India's villages, and urbanisation combined with industrialisation is almost certainly the only way that sufficient wealth can be generated for future generations to enjoy a better life. It is simply not the case that most people in India are worse off now than 20 or 30 years ago, as a glance at figures for literacy, life expectancy, maternal mortality and so on makes clear. Gains are grossly unequal, but real.</p><p>Perhaps this is clutching at straws. Dasgupta may well think so. His final warning is that Delhi, as it is not as it might be, is the future, and not just of India's cities but of hundreds of others across the planet.</p>","headline":"Capital review – Rana Dasgupta's perceptive exploration of modern Delhi","trailText":"<p>Rana Dasgupta's powerful study suggests the savage realities of modern-day Delhi will not be changing any time soon, writes <strong>Jason Burke</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395060980921/capital-delhi-review-rana-006.jpg","wordcount":"981","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-24T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/capital-review-rana-dasgupta-modern-delhi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/23/capital-review-rana-dasgupta-modern-delhi","tags":[{"id":"books/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/society","references":[]},{"id":"world/delhi","webTitle":"Delhi (News)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/delhi","references":[]},{"id":"cities/cities","webTitle":"Cities","type":"keyword","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/cities","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/cities/cities","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/india","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jasonburke","webTitle":"Jason Burke","rcsId":"GNL001549","r2ContributorId":"15798","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538178716/Jason-Burke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jason Burke is the south Asia correspondent of the Guardian and the Observer newspapers.</p><p>In more than a decade as a staff correspondent with the papers, Burke has reported on a wide range of subjects in countries from Algeria to Cambodia, from Uzebkistan to Zimbabwe. </p><p>Based in Pakistan from 1998 to 2002,  reporting from Afghanistan under the Taliban and during the war of 2001, he has returned to Pakistan and Afghanistan many times since.

Welcome to the 'overwhelm'. Brigid Schulte's book is a prescription for treating our doing-too-much culture","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-maynard-keynes\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a> predicted that within a century, we would work only 15 hours a week. Just over two decades later, a fresh-faced vice-president called Richard Nixon volunteered that, by 1990, Americans would retire at the age of 38. And yet somehow, despite all the gadgets and gizmos that were supposed to set us free from drudgery – dishwashers, disposable nappies, Skype – many people in the developed world now feel they are working harder than ever.</p><p>Brigid Schulte (pictured) calls this \"the overwhelm\". The Washington Post reporter's engaging book – which is by turns a pop science explainer, self-help guide and subtle feminist polemic – aims to discover why some of us feel there simply aren't enough hours in the day. She sympathises: juggling family and career, and feeling guilty about neglecting both, she is \"scattered, fragmented, exhausted\". Not only is she doing too much – she feels she should always be doing more.</p><p>It is a common sentiment, particularly among working mothers; I&nbsp;recently sat in a room full of high-profile women in the media, discussing how they made it to the top. The answer, again and again: working part-time when their children were young, and in one case, having a stay-at-home husband. They were proof you couldn't \"have it all\", if&nbsp;that meant working 60 hours a week while raising a young family. \"With work, if it had been all or nothing, I&nbsp;would have chosen nothing,\" one said.</p><p>That is Schulte's diagnosis, too: by far the most leisure-time-starved group in society are mothers (particularly single mothers). It took decades for researchers to realise this, because they initially regarded childcare and housework as leisure time (most were men). This isn't a book that hammers you with its feminist credentials, but there is an&nbsp;unavoidably gendered aspect to our ideas of what constitutes \"real work\", even though you'd be hard-pressed to argue that a screaming toddler is the easy option compared with piddling round on Microsoft Excel.</p><p>But even as an increasing number of&nbsp;women work full-time outside the home, our attachment to traditional gender roles is hard to shake. Mothers still do far more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both&nbsp;parents work – and dads' time with their kids is often in the company of their partner, making them the \"helping\" parent, or the \"fun\" parent. Mums get to be the \"supervisory parent\", and therefore can't ever really relax. (In gay&nbsp;couples, the roles are much more likely to be equitably shared.) Such women experience free time in tiny gobbets, all the while hoping there isn't anything important in their stack of unread emails, and that odd smell isn't cat sick under the stairs again.</p><p>Fighting \"the overwhelm\" means identifying the problem, and there are three villains in this book: our jobs, our&nbsp;expectations and ourselves. Give a&nbsp;small cheer here if you live in Europe, because it turns out that America really, really hates its citizens and wants them to be unhappy. \"The US is&nbsp;the only advanced economy that doesn't guarantee workers paid time off,\" Schulte writes. \"Nearly one-quarter of all American workers get no paid vacation, most of them low-wage and part-time workers.\" Oh, and don't expect any paid maternity leave either; there is no legal requirement to offer it. All this is a legacy of the religious right's dominance in the 1970s, when firebrands such as <a href=\"http://buchanan.org/blog/\" title=\"\">Pat Buchanan</a> decided that nurseries were probably a plot to indoctrinate children and make them into tiny commies. Schulte gazes longingly towards Scandinavia, with its family-friendly policies, but the US situation sounds so bad I even felt a&nbsp;twang of pride for Blighty.</p><p>The next cause of the overwhelm is&nbsp;a construct Schulte calls the \"ideal worker\". The ideal worker is&nbsp;the perfect capitalist machine-part, never seizing up or breaking down, always ready for overtime or foreign travel, never missing a day to look after a sick child or parent. Many businesses are in the grip of \"presenteeism\", imagining that there is a&nbsp;perfect correlation between time spent with&nbsp;bum on office chair and productivity. There isn't: research shows most people can only do eight hours of quality work a day. After that, they are just desk meat, surreptitiously playing Solitaire in a&nbsp;browser window or daydreaming about dinner. A macho long-hours culture hurts men just as much as women: when new dads ask for flexible working, they get burned both by the assumption they are not dedicated to the job and the assumption they are big old Girlie Men.</p><p>We can't blame everything on heartless employers, though. The relatively affluent have to take some responsibility for worshipping at the Altar of Overwork, an attitude Schulte calls \"busier than thou\". Just as having a tan became a status symbol once it denoted that you could afford foreign holidays, so being overwhelmed is a&nbsp;badge of honour for middle-class professionals. Oh, between Jonny's clarinet lessons and my Mandarin classes and Steve getting promoted to partner, I&nbsp;don't have a minute to myself, they trill. Having no free time makes the point you don't just have a&nbsp;job. You have a&nbsp;career. You&nbsp;are Going Somewhere.</p><p>Schulte's prescription is simple: decide whether you love the bragging rights of being busy enough to live in a&nbsp;debilitating whirlwind of activity. If&nbsp;you don't, perhaps leave the clarinet unmolested and the boxercise class undone. As for housework, one researcher's message to women is refreshingly simple: be a slattern. \"Do&nbsp;you have to be able to do open-heart surgery on the kitchen floor?\" he&nbsp;asks. Also, make sure Himself pulls his weight.</p><p>This book's strength is mixing research and anecdote in a lively, accessible way, with a reporter's eye for&nbsp;detail. I underlined a passage about&nbsp;\"establishing metrics to measure success and feedback loops to course-correct\" to remind me just how refreshingly little hand-wavy mumbo-jumbo there is elsewhere. The obvious criticism is that Schulte's message speaks largely to uptight overachievers in creative fields, and being told to lobby for a four-day week or a 4pm hometime won't cut much ice if you are on the minimum wage or a zero-hours contract. (The author does acknowledge that the figure for average working hours is misleading because it obscures the gulf between the crazy-busy top of the labour market and the underemployed bottom, yet is&nbsp;otherwise prone to breezy generalisations.) But, of course, a book like this can't hope to tackle every aspect of&nbsp;such a complex subject, and even if it did, no one would have time to read the result.

Over 90 volumes written in a mere 20 years: the&nbsp;rate of composition alone is enough to make one feel faint. And, if&nbsp;you have A-level French or better, however rusty it may be, there's the nagging sense that you also ought to be&nbsp;reading them in French ...</p><p>Here is an extremely elegant way around this problem, which will not only provide you with a thorough feeling for the joys of Balzac but will do&nbsp;so without the massive digressions that can clog up the longer works (hag‑ridden by debt, he wrote like a&nbsp;maniac to fend off his creditors, and&nbsp;sometimes you can tell he's channelling the French equivalent of&nbsp;Private Eye's Phil Space in order to&nbsp;get to his daily word-count).</p><p>Here are nine stories and novellas, all nicely translated by Linda Asher with only the rare, jarring Americanism (\"Say ...\" for \"<em>mais voilà </em>...\"; forgivable); and a very good introduction by academic Peter Brooks, who writes insightfully and without jargon. The stories feature characters from the <em>Comédie</em> – some of them are,&nbsp;in a sense, a trial run for the larger&nbsp;works; but all are in their way fully achieved.</p><p>Brooks quotes Oscar Wilde: \"the 19th century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac's.\" When Wilde said that, it was one of his great gags with a solid vein of truth in it; now, the&nbsp;truth is even more obvious. Only Dickens can compete on such terms; and if you go by output alone, Balzac blows him away. I would also say that delightful and brilliant though Dickens is, Balzac is quite simply the superior novelist, more on the alert against mawkishness. You can't imagine a&nbsp;Wildeism about Balzac along the lines&nbsp;of only a heart of stone not being moved to laughter by the death of Little Nell. Balzac is, basically, more grown up. You get the sense that you&nbsp;are reading an undeceived, undeceivable adult – albeit one with a&nbsp;highly developed sense of the melodramatic, and the potency of story itself. Many of his stories are enfolded within themselves – narrator passing on the story told by a character he meets, etc – and sometimes I found myself thinking of a large-scale version of the miniaturist Stefan Zweig.</p><p>Again and again, though, Balzac returns, obliquely but obsessively, to&nbsp;the fact of his extraordinary facility for creation; his characters lose themselves in thoughts and imaginings about the lives of people they see in the street. One of his most intriguing and compelling characters, the money-lender Gobseck in the eponymous story, describes himself as you imagine Balzac might: \"Do you think it's nothing, this power to see into the most secret recesses of the human heart, to engage another person's heart, to see it all stripped naked? It&nbsp;is&nbsp;always drama, always different: hideous wounds, deathly sorrows, love scenes, griefs likely to end beneath the waters of the Seine, a young man's pleasures that lead to the scaffold, despairing laughter, and sumptuous celebrations.\" That, essentially, is Balzac's work: never a dull moment, with ruin or scandal always but a step&nbsp;away, lovers declaring that they must love so-and-so or die – and then delivering on that oath. (This occurs in&nbsp;\"Sarrasine\".)</p><p>Balzac was also incredibly influential. Without him, no Proust, no&nbsp;Flaubert, and – who knows? – no&nbsp;realism. He was also one of the novelists who appreciated that, above all, a novel is a means of transport between very different modes of experience. He wanted, in real life, to&nbsp;build a spiral staircase between the&nbsp;Jardin de Luxembourg and the catacombs beneath; and that's a fairly obvious metaphor for how he saw his grand work, as a bridge between the highest and lowest of society. And the&nbsp;great thing about work this entertaining is that it's still exciting nearly 200 years on; so it isn't just a bridge, it's a fully functioning time machine. I strongly recommend you&nbsp;hop in.</p>","headline":"The Human Comedy: Selected Stories by Honoré de Balzac – review","trailText":"<strong>Nicholas Lezard's paperback of the week: </strong>Here is an extremely elegant way to experience the joys of Balzac without learning French","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680214565/Honore-de-Balzac-006.jpg","wordcount":"646","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T17:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction-in-translation","webTitle":"Fiction in translation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction-in-translation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction-in-translation","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard's choice","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaslezard","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard","rcsId":"GNL034660","r2ContributorId":"16172","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374241286766/Nicholas-Lezard.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaslezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaslezard","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432872827","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680206275/Honore-de-Balzac-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Roger Viollet/Getty Images","photographer":"Lapi","altText":"Honore de Balzac","height":"54","credit":"Lapi/Roger Viollet/Getty Images","caption":"Better than Dickens … Honoré de Balzac.

Much of the city shared his opinion. For Wall Street traders, UN wonks, ad-land Mad Men, Italian crime lords, Moma curators, Stonewall protesters, Bleecker Street folkies and Nuyorican salsa stars, the Big Apple was, for all its faults, the 20th century's Rome.</p><p>In reality, Gotham was going bust, its shadows darkening. As the 1970s unfolded the city sank into a swamp of crime, its streets flooded with drugs, its mounting debts needing a 1975 bailout that President Gerald Ford at first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/nyregion/28veto.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">flatly refused</a> – letting the liberal city go bust would serve as a lesson.\"The rest of the country hated us,\" says Will Hermes, a <em>Rolling Stone</em> writer who grew up in Queens, and whose book, subtitled \"Five years in New York that changed music forever\", is a dazzling, kaleidoscopic homage to his home town from 1973 to 1977.</p><p>That subtitle is no hyperbole. Although rock is Hermes's principal focus, with the ascent of Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen as his lodestones, he writes with equal alacrity about NYC's other game-changing scenes: the birth of hip-hop at the DJ showdowns of Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash; the \"loft jazz\" movement instigated by David Murray and Anthony Braxton, the new strains of salsa cooked up by bandleader Willie Colón and Rubén Blades (\"A singer interested in being more than El Rey de Nueva York\"), and the cerebral, minimalist operas of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass\" title=\"\">Philip Glass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/laurie-anderson\" title=\"\">Laurie Anderson</a>. These were \"young iconoclasts on the edge of the mainstream\".</p><p>The upside of Gotham's decay was the availability of cheap property, especially on the Lower East Side, where musicians and artists could find living and performance space amid the decay and squalor. It made for a small town. The Talking Heads' Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz, for example, lived downstairs from jazz avant-gardist Don Cherry. On the nascent rock scene that revolved around the nightclub CBGB, everyone knew (and distrusted) everyone else, with acts falling into two distinct camps – the somewhat po-faced art-rock of Patti Smith, Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine, and the gutsier pop-rock of Blondie and the Ramones, all names that would spearhead New York punk in 1975 and 1976. Notable outbreaks of bad blood included a CBGB brawl between transvestite rocker Wayne County and \"Handsome\" Dick Manitoba of The Dictators that left the latter in hospital and the former in jail.</p><p>Hermes's method is strictly chronological, flitting from one music scene to the next while backgrounding seminal concerts and records with the city's political and social convulsions; the collapse of its transport system, the influx of cheap Asian heroin in 1973, the \"Great Dope Famine\" of 1976, and the paranoia unleashed by the murder spree of \"Son of Sam\" in 1977. His almanac requires Hermes to keep a lot of plates spinning, but its cornucopia of data builds a keen sense of a city brimming with music; the week before Springsteen debuted <em>Born to Run</em> at the Bottom Line you could have caught jazz magician Sun Ra at the venue.</p><p>Rock writing and music overlapped; the likes of Patti Smith and David Byrne would write in the <em>New York Rocker</em>, while scribes like Lester Bangs flirted with the stage. <em>Rolling Stone's</em> Jon Landau became Springsteen's manager. Hermes's own music commentary is informed and amusing; he describes Talking Heads (one of whose songs provide his title) as \"the sound of a panic attack massaged into a way of life\".</p><p>The book's 20-page epilogue wraps up the destinies of its protagonists. \"Hip-hop grew up to rule the world,\" submits Hermes, going onto consider the fate of NYC itself. \"The concentrated vitality of the 70s music scene diminished in the 1980s and 1990s as the city revived economically… the downtown artist ghetto became a high-end playground.\" The store where the Ramones played their first gig, he notes, is now a pet boutique.</p>","headline":"Love Goes to Buildings on Fire review: New York's 70s musical revolution remembered","trailText":"<p>Will Hermes's fast-paced history charts the rise of punk, hip-hop and the other musical movements that sprang up in New York in five feverish years, writes <strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395239485038/Patti-Smith-of-the-po-fac-004.jpg","wordcount":"651","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-22T23:03:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/love-goes-to-buildings-on-fire-will-hermes-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/23/love-goes-to-buildings-on-fire-will-hermes-review","tags":[{"id":"books/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/music","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/neilspencer","webTitle":"Neil Spencer","rcsId":"GNL106054","r2ContributorId":"16167","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/6/1225975769443/neil.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Neil Spencer is a writer and an astrologer for The Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/neilspencer","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/neilspencer","references":[]},{"id":"world/new-york","webTitle":"New York","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-york","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/new-york","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/books","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432677966","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395239480160/Patti-Smith-of-the-po-fac-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Michael Putland","altText":"Patti Smith of the 'po-faced art rock' faction on stage in New York, 1976.

The terrible irony is that when he was writing this book, Iain Banks did not know that he was dying. In the event he died soon after publication, after writing close to 30 novels, some literary, some science-fiction and some gothic. His many admirers will miss him; perhaps they will agree that this is a relatively minor piece compared, say, with the sublime <em>The Crow Road</em> and <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.</p><p>While, by all accounts, Banks died with great courage and dignity, the central character, Guy, seen by his autistic son, Kit, is raging against the dying of the light. He is not just raging, he is voluble, vicious and foul-mouthed. His anger and his contempt are sprayed without discrimination on his friends on popular culture, even on his son.</p><p>The book centres on a long weekend at Guy's dilapidated house, soon to be sold to the adjoining quarry, convened by his friends as a farewell. These friends were all together at Bewford University, a fictional version of Durham. They represent a cross section of university graduates, but they seem to be emblematic rather than fully drawn. Their conversations quickly become tedious.</p><p>As Guy rants, his dutiful if odd – his own description – son is wonderfully solicitous towards him, even to the extent of wiping his bottom for him. The description of the final stages of his cancer are harrowing and unflinching, even unbearable.</p><p>The problem with the novel is that the friends from uni are not clearly differentiated, and their dialogue on this awful weekend doesn't ring true; it's relentlessly declamatory, aggressive and critical. As the weekend lurches on, the friends also attack one another woundingly, and, late in the book, literally. At times it's a sort of provincial <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em> Now in their mid-40s, they are all hellbent on recreating their halcyon student days; they drink huge amounts and they snort cocaine and light joints when they aren't drinking.</p><p>At university the friends made short films – one of them has gone on to be an impoverished freelance film critic – but their lives have not gone well. As one of them says, none of them would have chosen the lives they are now leading. They know that somewhere in Guy's house is an old video which they want to find because it contains some very compromising material, possibly pornographic. Paul, the most successful of the friends, gives Kit money to encourage him to find this tape. He is an aspirant politician, so he is particularly keen to have it destroyed.</p><p>Eighteen-year-old Kit is autistic; autism is perhaps a rather overdone device in contemporary fiction. Anyway, Kit plays war games on his computer constantly, has extremely rigorous routines around the house and is flustered – for example – if the front door bell rings more than once. has never told him who his mother is, and he suspects that one of the women present might be that mother. A virgin, Kit makes some awkward, and rebuffed, advances on one of the women. In fact as the voice of the novel, he is improbably articulate and his accounts of the weekend are numbingly prolix. Although this is some way from being in the first rank of of his books, Banks's many admirers will undoubtedly be grateful for the book and its occasional flashes of brilliance. <strong> </strong></p>","headline":"The Quarry review – Iain Banks's last book contains a final irony","trailText":"<p>Iain Banks's final work is not his best but his fans will love it, writes <strong>Justin Cartwright</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395146137479/iain-banks-quarry-review-006.jpg","wordcount":"583","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-12T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/the-quarry-review-iain-banks-last-book","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/23/the-quarry-review-iain-banks-last-book","tags":[{"id":"books/iainbanks","webTitle":"Iain Banks","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/iainbanks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/iainbanks","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"society/cancer","webTitle":"Cancer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/cancer","references":[]},{"id":"profile/justin-cartwright","webTitle":"Justin Cartwright","r2ContributorId":"53530","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/justin-cartwright","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/justin-cartwright","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/books","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432678590","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395146125713/iain-banks-quarry-review-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Murdo MacLeod","photographer":"Murdo MacLeod","altText":"iain-banks quarry review","height":"54","credit":"Murdo MacLeod/Murdo MacLeod","caption":"Iain Banks: The Quarry, about a man dying of cancer, was written before the writer knew he was himself terminally ill.

A new Val McDermid, set at the Edinburgh festival. As it's against the law to write a book about the Edinburgh festival without someone discovering a&nbsp;dead standup comedian bobbing about in the Water of Leith, and as McDermid excels at crime fiction, I was tempted to bolt the door and gobble the book down in one sitting. But this novel is a very different proposition indeed, part of The Austen Project, a&nbsp;series that includes Joanna Trollope's take on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/27/joanna-trollope-sense-sensibility-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>, and promises to bring us <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Curtis Sittenfeld and <em>Emma</em> by Alexander McCall Smith, all&nbsp;with a contemporary setting.</p><p>So instead of reading gothic romance, for example, Catherine Morland reads <em>Twilight</em>; instead of letters brought in by maids, they post on Facebook, and so on. These aren't short stories or exercises in style; they are full-length novels, months of work from busy authors at the top of their game. The book itself is perfectly diverting; it follows the original plot&nbsp;very closely, and it is funny and brilliantly written. People who think of&nbsp;McDermid as a dark, intense writer will have a much lighter, jollier time – anyone who has tried to heave their way to a bar in the Assembly Rooms in&nbsp;August is probably experiencing something similar to a dance at the Bath Pump Rooms in the early 19th century.</p><p>But the real question is, why? Why do it? Who's it for? The world is neck-deep in Austen knock-offs, from the sensational (<em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em>, <em>Clueless</em>) to the lamentable (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1985019/\" title=\"\"><em>Austenland</em></a>). As an author, she has not just been done to death, she has been pounded, repeatedly and continuously, with a stick made out of a dead horse.</p><p>Austen's beautifully observed work had much to say about the marriage market, money, love and their confluence in human emotions. And McDermid echoes it, the message being, presumably, that in the world of&nbsp;practicality versus passionate love – sense and sensibility – nothing ever really changes. But we know this already: from <em>Lost in Austen</em>, from the&nbsp;evergreen Andrew Davies BBC adaptations, from PD James's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/31/death-comes-to-pemberley-pd-james\" title=\"\"><em>Death Comes to Pemberley</em></a>, from every Romantic novelist who ever wrote about a grumpy but, happily, solvent man.</p><p>And simply to take the plot seems peculiar when what makes Austen so great is the voice, the insight, the feeling for humanity (this is doubly true for <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, which may be her funniest novel, but in plot terms isn't the most watertight). Genius is eternal. There is no need to turn a barouche into a Triumph Spitfire. What would make a much more interesting project would be to take an author venerated in their time but difficult to read now; someone should have a shot at Guillaume de Lorris.</p><p>Weirdly, in its incredibly high-stakes world of lifelong mating, and despite its constipated, joke-free prose, <em>Twilight</em> – the novel beloved of McDermid's Catherine Morland – has more in common with Austen than McDermid's book does. There is some delightful social skewering, and McDermid is clearly enjoying herself, but it feels as though there is nothing new to say on the subject – or so you might have thought. It is ironic that this project is happening now, at the same time as a genuinely stark, beautiful and new way of looking at Austen has appeared. That book is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/14/longbourn-carriage-house-austen-review\" title=\"\"><em>Longbourn</em>, by Jo Baker</a>, and I very much commend it to you.</p>","headline":"Northanger Abbey by Val McDermid review – 'Austen for the Facebook age'","trailText":"McDermid's addition to the Jane Austen Project may be funny and beautifully written, but surely it's time to rework a less fashionable author, writes <strong>Jenny Colgan</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395661138682/Val-McDermid-004.jpg","wordcount":"557","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T10:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","tags":[{"id":"books/janeausten","webTitle":"Jane Austen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/janeausten","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"books/val-mcdermid","webTitle":"Val McDermid","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/val-mcdermid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/val-mcdermid","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jennycolgan","webTitle":"Jenny Colgan","r2ContributorId":"26661","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/28/1340876245226/JennyColgan2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jenny Colgan is a novelist, journalist and occasional radio pundit.
