That many of the displaced Rohingya people in Burma's Rakhine state took this decision demonstrates how difficult their lives have become.</p><p></p><p>For months now, the Rohingya Muslim people have been targeted in a campaign that a <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/burma0413webwcover_0.pdf\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch report</a> (pdf) has described as \"ethnic cleansing\". Rohingya Muslims in Burma have been forced into segregated settlements and camps, and – in many cases – cut off from lifesaving aid.</p><p></p><p>I visited displacement camps in Rakhine in May with <a href=\"http://refugeesinternational.org/\" title=\"\">Refugees International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Burma Campaign UK</a>, meeting with displaced people who – after suffering horrific attacks by members of the Rakhine Buddhist community in October –were forced to flee into remote areas of the countryside, areas completely unsuitable for displacement camps.</p><p>Drinking water had to be brought in on boats by NGOs, and primary healthcare was provided one morning a week. If you needed medical help at other times, you had to hope an NGO would come by boat to get you.</p><p>Residents of this squalid community fall ill frequently due to insanitary conditions. I travelled by boat for two hours to Pauktaw, where a <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>-supported camp is home to thousands of Rohingya people. The shores adjacent to the camps were covered in faeces, with dead rats floating in the water just metres from where children were bathing to keep cool in the heat.</p><p></p><p>Since it was attacked, the Rohingya community has been totally cut off from markets and job opportunities; living in a segregated area, its people are barred by the authorities from travelling to the sites where they used to work and trade. Donor governments – including the UK – have helped provide some basic services, but it is nowhere near enough to give these people a safe and dignified existence.</p><p></p><p>The Rohingyas I met were living in flimsy tents so close to the shore that there was no way they could survive the monsoon season, let alone a cyclone. Even the emergency evacuations now underway will not be enough to get them safely through the coming months. During my visit, I was told that it would take at least two months to build temporary shelters on higher ground, and the government has delayed allocating the necessary land, perhaps in an attempt to assuage local Rakhine extremists. All of this demonstrates the unwillingness of the government to prioritise the safety of the Rohingya community.</p><p></p><p>Aid agencies have had real difficulties in getting help to people. Apart from the logistical problems created by the camps' isolation, the government has introduced bureaucratic obstacles, including serious delays in providing travel authorisations and visas for aid staff. Most troubling, some Rakhine Buddhist political and religious leaders have made threats against aid agencies because they object to assistance being offered to to the Rohingyas. Instead of taking action, the government refuses to let aid workers operate in areas where threats are made.</p><p></p><p>Displaced people told me about family members they had lost in the October attacks, speaking of their grief. Most wanted to return home, but were too scared to do so without appropriate protection. And they were aware that rather than focusing on moving people to higher ground during April, the government was conducting a \"verification exercise\" in displacement camps, in which they tried to force Rohingyas to sign forms admitting that they were \"Bengalis\". This only added to their distrust of the authorities, which was already high after many of the security services either committed or condoned attacks on their community last year. People told me that they would never be allowed to return home because local authorities were trying to create Muslim-free zones.</p><p></p><p>In a discussion with a group of Rohingya women, I listened to stories of family members being killed; some had lost seven, eight, nine loved ones. After hearing these testimonies, I wasn't surprised that some Rohingya people took the seemingly irrational decision to refuse relocation in the face of a cyclone. They are so desperate that they do not know who to trust or where they may be sent next. And, as a woman who lost her entire family said, \"If, after having lost everything – including my whole family – because we are Rohingya Muslims, [the government] still don't recognise me as Rohingya in my own country, then I might as well be dead\".</p><p></p><p>The UK government, together with the rest of the international community, must keep the pressure on the Burmese government to facilitate full humanitarian access to the Rohingya, end segregation in Rakhine state, provide them with the protection they need to return home, and restore their Burmese citizenship.</p><p></p><p>• <em>A video

Since the outbreak of the inter-African war for DRC resources following the invasion of the Congo by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, Kagame learned it would do no good for Rwanda to be so openly involved in invading, occupying and looting its giant neighbour.</p><p>The very name M23 is a clear indication of the umbilical cord tying it to the CNDP, since the group claims its rebellion is in retaliation to the non-respect of the peace agreement between Joseph Kabila – Laurent's son and president of Congo since 2001 – and the CNDP on 23 March 2009. Despite its diplomatic language, that agreement represents the capitulation of the Kabila government to the strategic interests of Rwanda, incorporating into the Congolese army a militia group composed of Congolese Tutsi and Rwandan soldiers, and loyal to a foreign army.</p><p>While renegade general and CNDP founder Laurent Nkunda was placed under house arrest, his deputy Jean-Bosco Ntaganda was named a general in the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo, a fifth column within the Congolese army, despite an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18838708\" title=\"\">arrest warrant</a> issued by the international criminal court (ICC).  In March, President Kabila gave indications of succumbing to the pressures of his western masters who, having allowed him to remain in power <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/29/democratic-republic-congo-call-election-annulled\" title=\"\">despite a presidential election that he clearly lost</a> in November 2011, insisted that he deliver \"the Terminator\" (Ntaganda's nickname) to the ICC. Thus began the newest \"rebellion\" under the CNDP's new name, the M23.</p><p>Three lessons are to be drawn from this latest episode of Rwanda's aggression against the DRC. First is that the root cause of the unending crisis in Congo is the absence of a legitimate government and a viable state. A weak and extremely unpopular leader, Kabila is a usurper who has no legitimacy and is incapable of discharging the duties of chief executive in a strategically important country such as the DRC. During nearly 12 years in power, he has squandered the country's wealth and failed to build effective state institutions, particularly the army, police and civil service. If he has any respect for himself and love for a country he considers his homeland, he ought to resign.</p><p>Second is that Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni will not stop their attempts to control and loot North and South Kivu (for Rwanda) and the Ituri district of the Eastern Province (for Uganda) as long as Kinshasa is unable to protect its borders. As strong allies of the US in the \"war against terror\" in the region, and particularly in Sudan (where Rwanda has an important contingent in the UN/African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur) and in Somalia (where Uganda is leading the fight against the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab), they can count on US and UK support. Witness the major powers' failure to impose sanctions on both countries in the face of numerous reports implicating them in human rights violations and the looting of DRC natural resources. Most shocking in this regard is the international community's silence on the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/RDCProjetMapping.aspx\" title=\"\">2010 mapping report</a> of the UN high commissioner for human rights on crimes against humanity, war crimes, and possibly crimes of genocide committed by the current Rwanda regime within the Congolese territory between 1994 and 2003.</p><p>The third lesson is that, under the circumstances, the people of Congo would be fooling themselves to believe that they can count on the international community to deliver them from Kigali, Kampala and their external backers. If 13 years of UN peacekeeping and $1.5bn spent each year for the UN mission cannot deliver peace and stabilisation, what can other \"neutral\" forces from Africa or elsewhere do to change the situation? The salvation of Congo lies in the hands of her own sons and daughters.</p>","headline":"Only the Congolese people can save Democratic Republic of the Congo","trailText":"<p><strong>Georges

Their children looked on with glassy stares, utterly exhausted after days at sea in an open boat. Soon they would be on the water again, escorted by a Bangladeshi coast guard vessel and pushed back into the waters of Burma where they knew <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/26/burma-rohingya-persecution-ethnic-violence\" title=\"\">violence still raged</a>.</p><p>\"The Mogh slaughtered my brothers. They will kill us all … please help us!\" screamed a woman carrying a baby only a few months old, before she was hustled away by border guards.</p><p>The sectarian violence in Burma that has sent boatloads of refugees fleeing to Bangladesh in recent weeks – and being firmly pushed back – has once again turned the spotlight on the plight of Burma's Rohingya minority.</p><p>There is no place the Rohingya people can call home. Burma passed a law in 1982 – criticised as discriminatory by human rights groups – that effectively rendered them stateless. Waves of ethnic violence since 1991, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/asia/burmese_muslims.pdf\" title=\"\">some of it state-sponsored</a>, have pushed more than 250,000 Rohingyas into Bangladesh, where they live in squalid, makeshift camps with little or no access to healthcare or education.</p><p>Nozir Hossain, 70, knows well what it means to live in limbo. Hossain, who used to be a farmer in the Maung Daw area of Burma's Arakan state, has been living in an unauthorised camp in Teknaf, on Bangladesh's southern tip, since 2001.</p><p>Sitting in the tiny shack he shares with four others, Hossain described the day his family was forcibly uprooted. \"The Mogh [ethnic Rakhine] surrounded our village at dawn,\" he recalled. \"The Nasaka [Burmese border troops] were behind them. They set fire to the houses and chopped, hacked and shot at anyone who got in their way. Two of my sons were slaughtered in front of my eyes. When I flung up my arm to protect my head, a machete nearly took my hand off. I fell and lay in a pool of my sons' blood. The killers moved on, leaving me for dead.\"</p><p>Despite the horrors he has witnessed, Hossain hopes to go back to Burma one day. \"There is nothing for us here,\" he said. \"We would like to go back home … back to farming our land. I hope the government will be fair and give us our rights.\"</p><p>Hossain was repatriated to Burma in 2005, but he came back after finding his land occupied by Rakhine. He said both the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments are falsely characterising the position of the Rohingya.</p><p>\"The Burmese government says we're Bangladeshi, but the Arakan is the only home we know. My father was born in Arakan and so was my grandfather. The Bangladesh government says we're illegal migrants. But we didn't enter Bangladesh secretly to work. We came to save ourselves and our families.\"</p><p>According to Bangladeshi historian Abdul Aziz, there have been Muslims in Arakan since Arab traders came to the region in the eighth century. \"The poetry of 17th-century poets like Alaol clearly mentions Muslims in positions of power in the court of the Arakan king,\" Aziz said. \"The writing of travellers like Ibn Batuta in the 14th century proves that Bengal was one of the wealthiest nations in the world while Arakan was infested with pirates. There was migration from Arakan to Bengal and not the other way round.\"</p><p>Despite centuries-old roots in the Arakan region, discriminatory policies have been imposed on the Rohingya since Arakan was annexed by Burma in 1784. According to the Arakan Project, an NGO, the Rohingya are subjected to severe restrictions on their movement and marriages, and to arrests, extortion, forced labour and confiscation of land.</p><p>\"The Nasaka used to come and take away the men and boys,\" said Hossain. \"They forced us to work as labourers without pay. This was only done to us, not to Rakhine or anybody else.\"</p><p>The Rohingya have not fared much better on the Bangladesh side of the border. The government in Dhaka has refused to allow the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to register Rohingya arrivals since 1992. This means all but 30,000 of the Rohingyas are denied refugee status. The unregistered Rohingyas – more than 200,000 by some estimates – are officially considered illegal migrants and cannot get food rations provided by the World Food Programme. They are also denied access to basic healthcare and education provided by the UNHCR and its partner organisations.</p><p>The Bangladesh government is determined to keep services to a bare minimum to avoid creating a \"pull factor\" – conditions that will attract more refugees – an official of the ministry of food and disaster management said, on condition of anonymity.</p><p>As part of government policy, the NGO Affairs Bureau in Dhaka has not approved project proposals in health, education and other sectors in Cox's Bazar district, even if it benefits the local Bangladeshi community. Last year, Dhaka rejected a $33m UN joint initiative to develop Cox's Bazar with special focus on education and health.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-391985809\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/6/21/120621Bangladesh-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/6/21/120621Bangladesh-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/6/21/120621Bangladesh_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/6/21/120621Bangladesh_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120621Bangladesh/120621Bangladesh.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>The government has also put a stop to the UNHCR's resettlement programme, under which 900 Rohingyas were resettled in third countries to restart their lives. Most went to Australia, the UK and Canada. In November 2010, the Bangladesh government suspended the programme, pending a review.</p><p>Life is grim even for those in the authorised refugee camp. Rohingya children in the camp are permitted to study up to primary level – fifth grade – but not beyond. \"Keeping them motivated is the main challenge,\" said Shahin Islam, director of the Education for Refugee Children project run by Save the Children. \"It's very easy for them to lose hope … they don't see a future ahead.\"</p><p>Many experts have questioned the view that registering more Rohingya nationals in Bangladesh will bring more refugees across the border. \"People do not leave their homes and go to a foreign country just because there's a basic health clinic or primary schools,\" said Jing Song, the UNHCR spokesperson in Dhaka. \"Knowing who the refugees are and where they are is the first step to a solution to this protracted refugee situation. It's not only to the benefit of refugees, but also to the benefit of the host country.\"</p>","headline":"Burma's Rohingya refugees find little respite in Bangladesh","trailText":"Sectarian violence in Burma has sent Muslim Rohingya refugees fleeing across the border, but they find themselves unwelcome in neighbouring Bangladesh","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/6/26/1340709902748/MDG--Burma-003.jpg","wordcount":"1016","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"392207810","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6347021","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Syed Zain Al-Mahmood in Teknaf","internalPageCode":"1765233","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-02T09:26:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/burma-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/burma-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh","tags":[{"id":"global-development/conflict-and-development","webTitle":"Conflict and development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/migration","webTitle":"Migration","description":"News and comment on migration to and from the developing world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/migration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/migration","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/global-development","references":[]},{"id":"world/refugees","webTitle":"Refugees","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees","references":[]},{"id":"world/burma","webTitle":"Burma","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/burma","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/burma","references":[]},{"id":"world/bangladesh","webTitle":"Bangladesh","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/bangladesh","references":[]},{"id":"world/south-and-central-asia","webTitle":"South and Central Asia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-and-central-asia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/south-and-central-asia","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/syed-zain-al-mahmood","webTitle":"Syed Zain Al-Mahmood","r2ContributorId":"50314","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/11/1334143900511/zain2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Syed Zain Al-Mahmood is an investigative reporter and editor based in Dhaka, Bangladesh</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/syed-zain-al-mahmood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/syed-zain-al-mahmood","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-392212626","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/6/26/1340709910115/MDG--Burma-008.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Syed Zain Al-Mahmood","altText":"MDG : Burma","height":"276","credit":"Syed Zain Al-Mahmood/Guardian","caption":"Nozir Hossain shows the scar he received while trying to protect himself on the day his sons were killed.

A century later and history is repeating itself. This time, however, the aim is not target practice – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/21/sudan-genocide-nuba-warnings-ignored\" title=\"\">the aim is annihilation</a>.</p><p>Khartoum's bombs began raining on the Nuba people on 6 June last year. Since then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/18/sudan-khartoum-displaced-nuba\" title=\"\">half a million civilians have been displaced</a>, fleeing their homes from more than 1,000 confirmed aerial bombings by MIG fighter jets and Antonov warplanes. With little to protect them, people have resorted to digging holes in the ground or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/may/19/sudanese-people-caves-in-pictures\" title=\"\">making their homes in caves</a> just to hide from government forces. Unsurprisingly, food is scarce. With villagers unable to farm and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/20/profile-sudan-president-omar-al-bashir\" title=\"\">President Omar Hassan al-Bashir</a> preventing humanitarian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/20/conflict-nuba-mountains-epidemics\" title=\"\">aid from reaching the region</a>, widespread famine and disease are ever-present threats.</p><p>This is just the latest chapter of the Nuba people's bloodstained relationship with Khartoum. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, major military campaigns were waged against the region. Nuba leaders were executed en masse, the population forcibly displaced, and villages burnt to the ground to prevent people returning. This culminated in January 1992 with South Kordofan governor Lieutenant General al-Hussein formally declaring holy war in the Nuba mountains and advocating wholesale murder, abduction, rape, family separation and forced religious conversion.</p><p>The main intent, then as now, was a racially pure Arab Islamist state through ethnic cleansing of Sudan's traditional patchwork of peoples.</p><p>Any doubt about Khartoum's aim was laid bare last October with South Kordofan governor Ahmed Haroun's broadcast on government radio <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/2012331114433519971.html\" title=\"\">when he issued a rallying cry to his troops</a>: \"When you go on your mission, if you find them, kill them, sweep them away, eat them. Do not bring me any prisoners of war. We have no quarter for them.\"</p><p>How many more warnings from organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.wagingpeace.info/\" title=\"\">Waging Peace</a> – a human rights group that campaigns against genocide and systematic human rights violations, of which I am patron – will be necessary for the world to take notice? The Nuba people cannot afford another year to pass before the international community acts. Delay would risk yet again ignoring the pledge we make and break every time genocide takes place: \"Never again\".</p><p>The UK and international community must act now. Pressure should be applied on Khartoum to allow access for humanitarian aid agencies.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people are in dire need. Unless their most basic food, water and health needs are met urgently, we risk humanitarian catastrophe. In addition, a no-fly zone should be established to stop the government's aerial attacks, while UN sanctions should be applied to stop the flow of weapons to the government.</p><p>These actions would do much to prevent the situation deteriorating further. But ultimately, we must stop appeasing Bashir's regime. The world has averted its gaze from Sudan for too long in the hope Bashir would be more conciliatory. Yet it has led only to more belligerence, more bloodshed, and more terror for those living under his power.</p><p>Perhaps we should not be surprised. Conciliatory diplomacy was ineffective in Darfur – evidence shows trouble in the region is far from over. It is likely to be ineffective in the Nuba mountains.</p><p>Addressing the underlying cause of Sudan's troubles means ensuring Bashir and others in his regime are brought to justice at the international criminal court to stand trial for his crimes against humanity – otherwise we risk sitting idly by as they get away with murder.</p><p>• Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>","headline":"We must act now to stop the genocide of Sudan's Nuba people","trailText":"<p><strong>Giles Fraser:</strong> The international community has ignored Khartoum's attack on the Nuba people for too long – now humanitarian disaster looms</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/6/1338986187994/Aid-workers-assess-child--003.jpg","wordcount":"591","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"391189209","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6267021","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Fraser","internalPageCode":"1755807","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-09T13:10:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/act-now-stop-genocide-sudan-nuba","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/act-now-stop-genocide-sudan-nuba","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/sudan","webTitle":"Sudan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/sudan","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/conflict-and-development","webTitle":"Conflict and development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/aid","webTitle":"Aid","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/aid","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilesfraser","webTitle":"Giles Fraser","rcsId":"GNL499962","r2ContributorId":"20945","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/8/1362747005387/Giles-Fraser.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dr Giles Fraser is priest-in-charge at St Mary's Newington in south London and the former canon chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral.

The internationally-brokered <a href=\"http://www.c-r.org/accord/mozambique\" title=\"\">1992 Rome Peace Accords </a>signalled the end of civil war and since then, peace has prevailed for 21 years.</p><p>But the peace that Mozambicans tried to preserve, and have so prided themselves on over the years, is at risk of collapsing due to <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/10/mozambican-rebel-group-denies-attack-2013102795429330980.html\" title=\"\">armed conflict between Renamo's ex-fighters and government troops in the Sofala province</a>. Although Renamo does not take responsibility for the violent attacks, dozens have been killed, including many civilians, and hundreds of families have been forced to leave their homes to take shelter in the bush.</p><p>In the largest cities in the country, at the end of October and the beginning of November, citizens from all over the country organised marches calling for the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201311182345.html%E2%80%9D http://allafrica.com/stories/201311182345.html\" title=\"\">end of hostilities and a return to stability</a>. But the voices of citizens appear not to have moved politicians who have demonstrated little interest in putting an end to the political-military crisis in the country.</p><p>With the intent of reaching an understanding, the Frelimo government and Renamo have completed 21 rounds of negotiations, but none have produced any real result.</p><p>Religious institutions, civil society and the international community have done little to nothing to help end the political crisis in Mozambique. One of the few international figures publicly involved in searching for a way out of armed conflict is Swedish Ambassador to Mozambique Ulla Andrea, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UAndren/status/397447699639070720\" title=\"\">confirmed on Twitter </a>she has been in contact with members of government to discuss a way out of the current situation, but that few had really lent their ears.</p><p>The fear of a new war is evident. It threatens to come at a moment when the country has experienced <a href=\"http://www.ventures-africa.com/2013/04/what-does-oil-and-gas-discoveries-mean-for-mozambique/\" title=\"\">huge discoveries of coal, natural gas and petroleum </a> that could change the lives of a large part of the population who live in extreme poverty. The economy has been boosted by the entry of large projects dedicated to the exploitation of mineral resources, that have employed thousands of Mozambicans. It also comes at a time when the first generation born after the civil war voted for the first time, in November's municipal elections, which were <a href=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20131120-mozambique-municipal-elections\" title=\"\">boycotted by Renamo</a>.</p><p>Mozambique has been a success story in terms of its preservation of peace, and now it runs the risk of becoming a failed state. <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=580%E2%80%9D http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=\"580\"\" title=\"\">Absolute poverty </a>(people living on below $1 per day), which affects 59,6% of the population, could get worse if nothing is done to reduce tensions.</p><p>An armed conflict would have major implications at regional and international levels since Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia depend extensively on Mozambican ports. An armed conflict would also undermine all foreign investment in Mozambique that has been significant in recent years. The United States has invested billions of dollars in<a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-02/17/c_132174275.htm\" title=\"\"> oil exploration in northern Mozambique </a>and there has been a major foreign investment in the heavy <a href=\"http://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/hvym/af/mz/p0005.htm\" title=\"\">mineral sands in Nampula Province </a>. Mozambique could lose all it gained with real effort in recent years.</p><p>One of the first measures needed to overcome the crisis is a serious dialogue and a commitment by the two sides. Inclusive political dialogue, where representatives of civil society and religious institutions can take part, is needed.</p><p>The international community, that contributes more than <a href=\"http://m.voaportugues.com/a/1698270.html%E2%80%9D http://m.voaportugues.com/a/1698270.html\" title=\"\">40% to Mozambique's state budget</a>,  can exert pressure on the government to propose an urgent solution for the conflict. The Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, the European Union, the UN and so many other international organisations can equally play an important mediating role in negotiations between the government and Renamo.</p><p>These organisations cannot just sit by and watch the country that is considered the \"pearl of the Indian Ocean\" to sink into a new civil war. Mozambique is not a country isolated from the rest of the world, and the need to consider international intervention in mediation stems from this. A new war would have regional and continental implications, causing a flux of refugees to neighbouring countries  and forcing Africa to shift its attention from fighting poverty and promoting economic development to solving yet another armed conflict. The world would witness yet another sad episode of civil war in the 21st century.</p><p>So there is a great and urgent need for intervention not only from national actors and institutions, but from international ones, to find a solution to the political and military crisis that comes from dialogue and not military action.</p><p>• This article was amended on 18 December 2013.

The international community must not stand idly by while its citizens are murdered","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T08:00:57Z","body":"<p>We are in a delicate situation in the Central African Republic, and the tension is mounting. There is a terrifying, real threat of sectarian conflict.</p><p></p><p>On a recent trip to Bossangoa province, I was shocked to discover that village after village had been deserted. People told us they were afraid of the Séléka rebels, that residents were opting to stay in the forest in inhumane conditions because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/central-african-republic-msf-report-violence\" title=\"\">brutality Séléka rebels had inflicted upon them.</a></p><p></p><p>As we journeyed along the road, an eerie calm enveloped us. And then we stumbled across a group of young people carrying traditional weapons. When we asked what they were doing, they said: \"We're here to protect the village from the Séléka, who have come to pillage, rob, kill and rape.\"</p><p></p><p>Our group ventured to another village, where we discovered that everything had been burned: the Catholic and Protestant churches, the mosque – everything had been reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Some <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e45c156.html\" title=\"\">65,000 people are displaced</a> in Central African Republic (CAR) because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jul/27/the-central-african-republic-a-country-abandoned-to-its-fate-video\" title=\"\">there is a lack of security</a>. It is heart-breaking to see people trapped away from home, too afraid to return.</p><p></p><p>The Séléka is 90% Muslim and 10% Christian. When they enter a town, they head for the Muslim communities, because Séléka chiefs speak only Arabic, not French or Songo, the two national languages. And when they rob villagers, they force members of the Muslim community to store their loot. This is why some residents are fooled into believing there is complicity between the Muslims and Séléka. But it is a far more complicated business than that.</p><p></p><p>The escalating situation in CAR has led to the imam of Bombari, the president of the Protestant community, and I to form what we have called a platform for peace. We have visited many villages and our message is clear – we want co-existence. Muslims and Christians must learn to live together in peace.</p><p></p><p>Irrespective of a person's faith, our group defends everyone, because all humans are sacred. We will not allow rebels to shatter our history of co-existence.</p><p></p><p>The African-led peacekeeping force, Misca, had been charged with disarmament and weapons collection, but it patrolled with the Séléka. This meant that if the rebels started abusing people, the Misca would withdraw, leaving the civilian population at their mercy. The Séléka would then loot, steal, rape, torture and commit summary executions.</p><p></p><p>With the support of aid charities such as Cafod, we want to draw global attention to our plight and encourage the international community to mobilise and demand a return to peace and security in CAR.</p><p></p><p>That is why I agreed to go to Europe to give evidence at the UN human rights council. The first thing we need is to disarm the rebels and then we must work with communities on peace and reconciliation, letting them know that it is possible to once again live together in peace.</p><p></p><p>Let us not forget that CAR is surrounded by other countries, with millions of inhabitants. If it becomes a sanctuary for terrorists, narcotics traffickers, jihadists and bandits, our neighbours will be affected too. To avoid this deadly contagion, we need to act now.</p><p></p><p>We want the elections to take place, but CAR's civil service has been destroyed – civil records no longer exist, so we have to reconstitute these and carry out another referendum and conduct a census.

But across the border in South Kordofan state people are living on the frontline, trapped in a war zone and deprived of their rights to basic humanitarian aid. As war planes bomb civilian areas and intense fighting continues, many innocent people are living in fear of attack.</p><p>I have firsthand experience of the brutality of war, torn from my family as a child and forced to fight during the civil war between the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Southern Kordofan state was one of the hardest hit regions in a war that lasted more than 20 years and claimed more than 2 million lives, including my mother's.</p><p>We cannot turn a blind eye and let history repeat itself. UN human rights officials have already warned that acts committed in South Kordofan may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Although exact numbers of people killed and injured remain unconfirmed – as access has been nearly impossible because of insecurity and government restrictions – it is estimated that a total of 1.4 million people have been affected by the conflict. More than 200,000 people have fled their homes, unable to cultivate their land as planting season begins. This puts them doubly at risk, with no means of earning a living or growing their own food. As a result, an estimated 4 million people in Sudan are likely to face high levels of food insecurity over the next few months, during an especially precarious time for large parts of Africa.</p><p>Unexploded weapons have been found on the grounds of three schools and land mines are hindering attempts to deliver life-saving aid. Aerial bombings, shooting and shelling continues in what increasingly appears to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/16/sudan-secret-un-reports-nuba\" title=\"\">a targeted campaign against the Nuba people</a>. Despite their affiliation with the southern rebels during the civil war, the Nuba's homeland was excluded from the referendum on independence, so it remained in Sudan when the new southern country was formed. South Kordofan was only granted a so-called \"popular consultation\", which would allow citizens to make their own choices, but even this has failed to happen.</p><p>Marginalising, oppressing and attacking borders has been the approach of the government in Khartoum for decades, and has been a chief reason for the conflicts in Darfur, the south and the east. As the international community continues to search in vain for a solution to the ongoing conflict in Darfur, the same pattern of violence and deprivation is now playing out in Southern Kordofan, with fears that it could become an escalating conflict and even spread to Blue Nile state.</p><p>But it is not too late for the international community to stop a humanitarian crisis from happening. Representatives from the governments of Sudan and South Sudan met last week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to restart negotiations. They must act now by agreeing on a ceasefire and by allowing aid to reach those who desperately need it.</p><p>The international community, through the UN security council, should authorise a robust UN peacekeeping mission with a mandate to protect civilians from further violence. Anything less would be to abandon the Nuba people, and indeed all communities in Southern Kordofan, in their hour of need. The people of Southern Kordofan – and the international community – will have to live with the consequences for years, if not decades, to come.</p>","headline":"We must act to stop South Kordofan

Support to find an alternative livelihood is needed if growers are to be weaned off this double-edged source of income.</p><p></p><p>\"Farmers grow opium poppy to buy food, pay off debt and have a cash income to pay school fees and health expenses,\" Gary Lewis, regional representative of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) told IRIN. \"To be effective we need to give farming communities alternatives which can provide a sustainable basis for them to earn a livelihood.\"</p><p></p><p>UNODC and NGOs have been working with local farmers for the past decade, trying to lure them away from poppy cultivation by providing alternative livelihood solutions, along with improved access to roads, waterways, irrigation and community health services.</p><p></p><p>\"Until recently, UNODC alternative development assistance, funded by the EU and the governments of Germany and Japan, was limited to small development projects in just three south Shan townships – wholly inadequate to Shan state and Myanmar's [Burma's] needs for improved infrastructure, markets, schools and sustainable livelihoods,\" says Lewis.</p><p></p><p>More than half a century of internal conflict between government forces and various ethnic and political rebel groups tore the country apart, causing instability and poverty. Ceasefire treaties signed early this year with groups in northern Burma, such as the Karen National Liberation Army and the Shan State Army-South, have allowed access to areas that were previously unreachable. After the ceasefires, the government approved townships where the UN drug agency can work, including access to 25 additional townships in Shan state.</p><p></p><p>\"We are encouraged by the recent ceasefire agreements and the fact that the national authorities have expanded the areas in Shan state in which UNODC is allowed to work,\" Lewis says. \"Solve the challenges of chronic poverty, decreasing rural food security and armed conflict – and you can begin to draw farmers away from poppy.\"</p><p></p><p>An <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/documents/crop-monitoring/sea/SouthEastAsia_2011_web.pdf\" title=\"\">opium survey</a> by UNODC in 2011 points out that there has been a marked increase in the area under opium cultivation in Burma – from 38,100 hectares (94,147 acres) in 2010 to 43,600 hectares in 2011 – mostly in Shan state. Yet the government has significantly increased its eradication efforts and a total of 6,124 hectares of opium poppy were destroyed there last year, compared with 5,316 hectares eradicated in 2010, the survey noted.</p><p></p><p>\"What happens in Myanmar's Shan state affects the whole region's security,\" Lewis says. \"Now is the time for the international community to engage in alternative development in the poppy-growing regions … as a natural counterbalance to the increased enforcement being conducted.\"</p><p></p><p>But political instability and poverty remain high in the area, and there is a strong chance that farmers could return to poppy cultivation if there is no alternative. According to the annual opium survey, poppies can bring in nine to 15 times more money per hectare than rice. Crops such as maize, <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95815/MYANMAR-Coaxing-farmers-to-grow-tea-not-opium\" title=\"\">tea</a> and rice are more labour intensive than poppies, and require expensive inputs, such as fertilisers, to cultivate and transport to markets.</p><p></p><p>\"Food shortages still exist and most households rely on purchasing food [rather] than on their own production,\" said Ohnmar Khaing, co-ordinator of the food security working group in Burma, an umbrella organisation of national and international NGOs.</p><p></p><p>\"Today, poorest of the poor ex-poppy farmers need help to turn to other crops … The reality is that the internal push to reduce opium poppy is proceeding too quickly, and without adequate resources or examination of the implications for the forgotten, impoverished poppy farmers,\" Khaing says. \"The essential challenge is to create development initiatives and economic incentives that provide attractive and viable legal alternatives for farmers.\"</p>","headline":"Burmese opium farmers need support to find an alternative livelihood","trailText":"The UN Office on Drugs and Crime says the international community

Conflict in Mali and increased violence in Nigeria from the radical Islamist group Boko Haram also caused large new displacements.</p><p>The report suggests that while a resolution to the conflict, particularly in Syria, is critical to dealing with an internal displacement crisis, so too is bridging the gap between emergency response and development.</p><p>\"Ninety percent of the countries monitored by IDMC have IDPs living in protracted displacement, often for decades, while second and third generations are born into displacement,'' said Kate Halff, director of IDMC.</p><p>She added: ''Governments are responsible for finding long-term solutions for their displaced citizens. However, they can only be realised when the governments and the international community recognise that people forced from their homes require not only a humanitarian response at the height of a crisis, but sustained engagement until a lasting solution is achieved.\"</p><p>African countries have emerged as pioneers in addressing the problem of IDPs. In December, the <a href=\"http://www.internal-displacement.org/kampala-convention\" title=\"\">Kampala convention</a>, the world's first legally binding instrument to outline the obligations of governments to protect and assist IDPs, came into force.</p><p>So far, the convention has been signed, although not necessarily ratified, by 37 of the 53 members of the African Union. It binds governments to provide legal protection for the rights and wellbeing of those forced to flee inside their own countries due to conflict, violence, natural disasters, or development projects. Under the convention, governments must gather data and identify IDPs to understand where they are and what they need, provide personal ID documents, trace families and help to reunite them, and consult IDPs in decisions on their needs.</p>","headline":"Wars push number of internally displaced people to record levels","trailText":"<p>Crises in Syria and Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012 help push total figure of people displaced worldwide to 28 million</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/4/26/1366988406886/MDG--IDP-in-Goma-Democrat-002.jpg","wordcount":"618","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"407912164","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7524474","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Tran","internalPageCode":"1899827","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-05-02T08:00:05Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/29/record-levels-internally-displaced-people","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/apr/29/record-levels-internally-displaced-people","tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/global-development","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/conflict-and-development","webTitle":"Conflict and development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/migration","webTitle":"Migration","description":"News and comment on migration to and from the developing world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/migration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/migration","references":[]},{"id":"world/internally-displaced-people","webTitle":"Internally displaced people","description":"The latest news and comment on internally displaced people","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/internally-displaced-people","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/internally-displaced-people","references":[]},{"id":"world/refugees","webTitle":"Refugees","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Violence has flared between a group of recidivist rebels and the national army, sending thousands fleeing to camps within the country and over the border to Rwanda and Uganda.</p><p></p><p>Former fighters of the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) mutinied in April, having been integrated into the army in March 2009. They have since moved from the old CNDP heartland of Masisi towards the borders with Rwanda and Uganda, driving a wave of terrified people ahead of them. Officials estimate that more than 40,000 people have been <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41972&amp;Cr=Democratic&amp;Cr1=Congo\" title=\"\">displaced by the fighting</a>, with more than 8,000 heading for Rwanda.</p><p></p><p>\"We're fleeing fighting between the ex-CNDP militia and the army,\" said Nzabandora, who did not give his last name, as he paused for a break on his walk from Kibumba to Goma last week. <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/congolese-soldiers-battle-mutineers-1.1292121\" title=\"\">Kibumba was attacked by the rebels on 8 May</a>; Nzabandora had pushed an improvised wooden bicycle, weighed down with his belongings, more than 10km. There was still another 15km to go. \"We saw lots of [national] army soldiers and fled,\" he said. \"The soldiers were moving towards the positions of the ex-CNDP, so we left.\"</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Kibumba residents made the same journey, not knowing where they would end up. \"I don't even have a destination,\" said Nzabandora. \"We will walk towards Goma, and hope to find somewhere to sleep. Maybe a church, or a school. We are simply fleeing for our lives – we have no hope for the future at the moment.\"</p><p></p><p>There was little support waiting for the fleeing population at Goma. Juvenal Sabonepa headed with his wife and children to Goma, even though he has no family or friends there. He had hoped for aid, but found nothing. \"No NGOs have come, there is no food, no drinking water, no healthcare,\" he said. \"We have to work together to look after ourselves, but we have nothing to give our children.\"</p><p></p><p>In the absence of support from NGOs or agencies, the community in Goma has come to the aid of the displaced population. Sabonepa and his family were welcomed into the home of Alphonse Katabera, who lives on Goma's outskirts. \"This is my house, we welcomed these people in,\" said Katabera. \"As you can see, there is nowhere else for them to go. The communities look after each other, we support each other. I have shared my house, my food, my drinking water with them. We are happy to welcome them.\"</p><p></p><p>Sabonepa's wife, Dafrose, explained that the displaced Kibumba community had come together to insulate the most vulnerable from the effects of the brewing conflict. \"We bring all the children together, we play with them,\" she said. \"It's important. They are traumatised by these events, we have to work together to maintain a sense of normality for them, even in these difficult times. The women also support each other. We can help each other by looking after each other's children, and sharing cooking.\"</p><p></p><p>Kouassi Lazare Etien, the head of the UNHCR sub-office in Goma, admits that the UN refugee agency was caught on the back foot by this population movement. \"The situation [at Kibumba] came as a surprise. The fighting flared up while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/02/thousands-flee-fighting-congo\" title=\"\">eyes were on Masisi</a>,\" he said. \"Luckily enough, this exodus did not last more than four or five days, and this population ultimately was able to return home.\" He added that the government must take much more responsibility for the conflict and displacements.</p><p>The Kibumba residents have now made the long trek home. The rebels have left the village and headed north along the Rwandan border, but they may not feel secure knowing that the conflict continues to ebb and flow further north, towards the border intersection of DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. Here, thousands more have fled as the fighting intensifies.</p><p></p><p>In Kiwanja, not far from the clashes between the army and rebels, there is a stark reminder of what is at stake. This was the site of a massacre in the 2008 conflict between the CNDP and the army, where International Criminal Court indictee and then-CNDP militiaman Bosco Ntaganda oversaw the slaughter of 150 people. The UNHCR camp in Kiwanja is still full of people displaced by that conflict.</p><p></p><p>\"I came here in 2008, from a village 30km away,\" explained Beatrice, whose baby was born in the camp. \"We can't go back, as there is no guarantee of peace or security.\" Another camp resident, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he has not been able to return home because his village, left untended for so long, has \"turned into jungle\".</p><p></p><p>The displaced people of the camp go into the neighbouring town to work as modestly paid cleaners or gardeners. There is a shared allotment next to the camp, where the displaced women cultivate vegetables. \"I cook the spinach that I grow for my children, and sell whatever else I can,\" says Gaurette. \"The community cultivates the garden together, which is good. But really, we just want to be able to return home.\"</p><p></p><p>Should the rebels seize Bunagana, a strategically important town on the Ugandan border where the fighting is now focused, their anti-government rhetoric and military positions will be ominously reminiscent of 2008. The local population can only hope a solution to the conflict is found quickly – and that the new camps springing up around north Kivu do not last as long as the one in Kiwanja.</p>","headline":"Shades of the past as people flee fighting in Congo's Kivu provinces","trailText":"The displacement of 20,000 Congolese people following violence between rebels and the army is ominously redolent of 2008","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/5/14/1337001572617/Congo-refugees-003.jpg","wordcount":"914","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"390095039","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6174718","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Pete Jones in Goma","internalPageCode":"1744986","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-05-21T06:00:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/18/fighting-congo-kivu-provinces","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/may/18/fighting-congo-kivu-provinces","tags":[{"id":"global-development/conflict-and-development","webTitle":"Conflict and development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/conflict-and-development","references":[]},{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development","type":"keyword","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-development","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/global-development/global-development","references":[]},{"id":"world/congo","webTitle":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/congo","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/refugees","webTitle":"Refugees","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/pete-jones","webTitle":"Pete Jones","r2ContributorId":"50517","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/7/19/1342688540672/Pete-Jones-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>I'm a freelance journalist working in east and central Africa, focusing on African politics, development and resources</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pete-jones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/pete-jones","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-390095590","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/5/14/1337001569399/Congo-refugees-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Dai Kurokawa","altText":"Congo refugees","height":"54","credit":"Dai Kurokawa/EPA","caption":"Congolese refugees fleeing fighting in north Kivu arrive at Nkamira transit camp, Rubavu district, near the border town of Gisenyi in Rwanda.

The government is deceiving the world about the real situation here; people are still trapped in the camps,\" says Milton Obote.</p><p></p><p>Obote, 49, and his wife, Mary, both have disabilities. They are among 300&nbsp;people living in Holy Rosary, a settlement in Gulu, northern Uganda. Between 1986 and 2006, the area became home to thousands fleeing fighting between the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), and Ugandan troops.</p><p></p><p>Obote is angry that politicians have claimed there is no one left in the region's camps, when he and other vulnerable people – including the elderly, Aids widows and <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=92122\" title=\"\">ex-combatants</a> – are still living there. Now they are being told they must leave immediately and return \"home\".</p><p></p><p>Obote fled his village, Atede, in fear of the LRA, a guerilla group led by Joseph Kony. Though the rebels engaged in talks, Kony refused to sign a final peace agreement in 2008. He remains at large and, wanted by the international criminal court for crimes against humanity, has since led the LRA through South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, most recently, the Central African Republic.</p><p></p><p>According to the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, more than 1.8 million internally displaced people (IDPs) were moved into 251 camps and \"protected villages\" during Uganda's so-called forgotten war (a&nbsp;designation attributable to northern Uganda's geographical and political marginalisation from the south, where the capital, Kampala, is located).</p><p></p><p>After the peace agreement, the process of resettlement began, led by the government through its <a href=\"http://www.prdp.org.ug/\" title=\"\">peace, recovery and development plan</a> (PRDP), launched in 2007 and implemented by the UNHCR. Last month, the UN officially ended its assistance in northern Uganda. Some 247 camps have been closed and, according to the UN, 98% of IDPs have since left, returning home or moving elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>However, the UN says 30,000 displaced Ugandans are still living in the four remaining camps. Vulnerable people like Obote don't have the means to leave.</p><p></p><p>\"We have to move out of here, but I'm struggling to get money to pay someone to build a house on my land before the deadline to leave at the end of January,\" says Obote as he sews a torn leather sandal for a few shillings. \"I mend shoes and radios, but it's not enough.\"</p><p></p><p>The PRDP was designed to deal with the immediate aftermath of the fighting and tackle severe poverty in the north; its ambitions do not appear to have been fully realised yet. The three-year project aims to funnel $600m from central government to districts in the north to fund empowerment programmes and build latrines, boreholes, health centres, classrooms and roads. But with implementation delayed and many of these basics yet to appear, the government is preparing to introduce a second phase from July, lasting another three years.</p><p></p><p>Rebecca Otengo, minister for northern Uganda, is leading the PRDP extension. \"The war went on for 20 years, so it can't simply be fixed in three years,\" she says.</p><p></p><p>Otengo points out that poverty levels in northern Uganda have reduced, but the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day (the measure the World Bank uses to assess poverty levels) is still 46%, almost double the national average. Otengo believes agriculture is the key to rebuilding the north's economy.</p><p></p><p>To boost farming, some returnees were given \"starter kits\". These included tools such as <em>pangas</em> (hoes), seeds, and metal sheets to build houses. However, some district authorities tasked with distributing the kits have been accused of providing cheap, substandard goods and pocketing the profits.</p><p></p><p>Gulu district chairman Martin Ojara concedes there has been corruption in the north, admitting that many districts have been unable to deal with the sudden influx of cash. \"We have notable issues of mismanagement,\" he says. \"Some are at central government level and others are at the local level. We lack the capacity to deal with the money.\"</p><p></p><p>A number of civil society organisations operating in the region believe money was squandered, partly because the plan was drawn up with little, if any, consultation with local communities, and thus failed to establish their needs.</p><p></p><p>Stephen Oola, of the Refugee Law Project, which champions the rights of Uganda's displaced people, says: \"There are no projects that show success, apart from a fleet of police patrol vehicles. Meanwhile, there are many people still in camps with no place to return to, such as orphans, elderly, widows and the disabled.\"</p><p></p><p>Oola says it is no wonder people like Obote feel abandoned, despite the \"grand gesture\" of the PRDP. \"People know they can't expect much from the government. The PRDP hasn't looked after them. People's priority now is to work out how they can survive by themselves.\"</p>","headline":"Northern Uganda's displaced people are left to fend for themselves","trailText":"<strong>Alice

That many of the displaced Rohingya people in Burma's Rakhine state took this decision demonstrates how difficult their lives have become.</p><p></p><p>For months now, the Rohingya Muslim people have been targeted in a campaign that a <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/burma0413webwcover_0.pdf\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch report</a> (pdf) has described as \"ethnic cleansing\". Rohingya Muslims in Burma have been forced into segregated settlements and camps, and – in many cases – cut off from lifesaving aid.</p><p></p><p>I visited displacement camps in Rakhine in May with <a href=\"http://refugeesinternational.org/\" title=\"\">Refugees International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Burma Campaign UK</a>, meeting with displaced people who – after suffering horrific attacks by members of the Rakhine Buddhist community in October –were forced to flee into remote areas of the countryside, areas completely unsuitable for displacement camps.</p><p>Drinking water had to be brought in on boats by NGOs, and primary healthcare was provided one morning a week. If you needed medical help at other times, you had to hope an NGO would come by boat to get you.</p><p>Residents of this squalid community fall ill frequently due to insanitary conditions. I travelled by boat for two hours to Pauktaw, where a <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>-supported camp is home to thousands of Rohingya people. The shores adjacent to the camps were covered in faeces, with dead rats floating in the water just metres from where children were bathing to keep cool in the heat.</p><p></p><p>Since it was attacked, the Rohingya community has been totally cut off from markets and job opportunities; living in a segregated area, its people are barred by the authorities from travelling to the sites where they used to work and trade. Donor governments – including the UK – have helped provide some basic services, but it is nowhere near enough to give these people a safe and dignified existence.</p><p></p><p>The Rohingyas I met were living in flimsy tents so close to the shore that there was no way they could survive the monsoon season, let alone a cyclone. Even the emergency evacuations now underway will not be enough to get them safely through the coming months. During my visit, I was told that it would take at least two months to build temporary shelters on higher ground, and the government has delayed allocating the necessary land, perhaps in an attempt to assuage local Rakhine extremists. All of this demonstrates the unwillingness of the government to prioritise the safety of the Rohingya community.</p><p></p><p>Aid agencies have had real difficulties in getting help to people. Apart from the logistical problems created by the camps' isolation, the government has introduced bureaucratic obstacles, including serious delays in providing travel authorisations and visas for aid staff. Most troubling, some Rakhine Buddhist political and religious leaders have made threats against aid agencies because they object to assistance being offered to to the Rohingyas. Instead of taking action, the government refuses to let aid workers operate in areas where threats are made.</p><p></p><p>Displaced people told me about family members they had lost in the October attacks, speaking of their grief. Most wanted to return home, but were too scared to do so without appropriate protection. And they were aware that rather than focusing on moving people to higher ground during April, the government was conducting a \"verification exercise\" in displacement camps, in which they tried to force Rohingyas to sign forms admitting that they were \"Bengalis\". This only added to their distrust of the authorities, which was already high after many of the security services either committed or condoned attacks on their community last year. People told me that they would never be allowed to return home because local authorities were trying to create Muslim-free zones.</p><p></p><p>In a discussion with a group of Rohingya women, I listened to stories of family members being killed; some had lost seven, eight, nine loved ones. After hearing these testimonies, I wasn't surprised that some Rohingya people took the seemingly irrational decision to refuse relocation in the face of a cyclone. They are so desperate that they do not know who to trust or where they may be sent next. And, as a woman who lost her entire family said, \"If, after having lost everything – including my whole family – because we are Rohingya Muslims, [the government] still don't recognise me as Rohingya in my own country, then I might as well be dead\".</p><p></p><p>The UK government, together with the rest of the international community, must keep the pressure on the Burmese government to facilitate full humanitarian access to the Rohingya, end segregation in Rakhine state, provide them with the protection they need to return home, and restore their Burmese citizenship.</p><p></p><p>• <em>A video

Soon throngs of people can be seen coming out of their makeshift homes and rushing towards the airfield, until they resemble a human fence, snaking five-deep around the camp. There are mothers in pastel hijabs, men in T-shirts and longyis, and naked children clutching on to grandparents, jostling for space among puddles and dust, held back by guards with rifles.</p><p>Here at Pauktaw refugee camp in Rakhine state – home to the inhabitants of five Rohingya Muslim villages who fled intercommunal conflict in western Burma this year – there are no schools, no work and no fields to cultivate – because no one is allowed to leave. When a helicopter lands, they hope it will bring either more supplies or some end to a way of life that has been unchanged for six months.</p><p>Since June Rakhine state, on the border with Bangladesh, has been ripped apart by violence between the majority Rakhine Buddhists and minority Rohingya Muslims, sparked by the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman. Thousands of homes have been destroyed, 200 people have been killed and more than 115,000 displaced.</p><p>Communities that once co-existed peacefully have been sent to segregated refugee camps all around the state, the majority of them filled with Rohingya – a population of roughly 800,000 who claim to be rightful citizens of Burma but whom the Burmese government widely calls \"Bengali immigrants\", denying them citizenship and placing restrictions on their rights to travel, attend higher education and even marry.</p><p>Accompanying a high-level delegation of Burmese officials and British diplomats – including the British ambassador to Burma, Andrew Heyn, and the minister for south-east Asia, Hugo Swire – to five refugee camps over a two-day period, the Guardian was escorted by gun-wielding Buddhist border guards to meet Pauktaw camp's Muslim leaders, who sit cross-legged on plastic sheeting underneath ripped tents suspended by salvaged wood.</p><p>Entirely reliant on aid, they said they needed greater medical care and want recognition as an ethnic group. \"Rakhines came to our villages and burned down our houses, that's why we're here,\" said one elder, his hands clasped tightly at his waist. \"We've been living here for generations and never had a situation like this, so I don't know why it happened. But now we have no documents – everything was burnt.\"</p><p>Tents are so scarce that many families have cobbled together thatch-and-corrugated iron shelters, sleeping on hay and torn blankets. Those that do exist bear Saudi Arabia's logo, but they are torn and thin – leftovers from a huge aid donation during cyclone Nargis. Aid workers said the UNHCR has been forbidden to provide the camp with new tents, but the reasons were unclear from both U Hla Maung Tin, chief minister of Rakhine state, and General Zaw Winn, Burma's deputy minister for border affairs, both of whom were part of the visiting delegation.</p><p>The British government is Burma's largest aid donor and through various NGOs is providing water, sanitation and healthcare to about 58,000 Buddhists and Muslims across the state. But camp conditions vary wildly in their size and ethnicity. In Mingan, a Rakhine camp of 300 people in Sittwe, water pumps, kitchen crops and rubbish bins make neat little rows next to the newly issued tents and their inhabitants are allowed to go into town and work. In contrast, none of the Rohingya the Guardian met said they were allowed to leave – \"for their own security\", officials explain – and they have watched instead as their farmland and animals have been taken over by Rakhine Buddhists.</p><p>Villages razed since the conflict began this summer, and reignited in October, have turned into breeding grounds for discontent. In Sittwe, the regional capital where much of the violence took place, the city is segregated along Muslim and Buddhist lines and a tight curfew is still in place. \"It is impossible for the Muslims to stay here now,\" said Cho Cho Lwin, 41, from her tent in Mingan. \"If we forgive them, they'll just do it again. They have always wanted to expand their land but until now didn't have the chance.\"</p><p>Many Burmese believe the Rohingya are illegal Bengali immigrants who crossed over from Bangladesh during the British occupation, and who aim to turn Rakhine into a Muslim state. As many Rakhine are fervent nationalists – Rakhine was an independent kingdom until 1784 – they worry that the Rohingya are extremists in disguise.</p><p>\"There are outside radical elements [at play] and [the Rohingya issue] is a tool of Islamicisation,\" said Oo Hla Saw of the Rakhine Nationalities Development party (RNDP). \"That is why we are afraid.\"</p><p>Most Burmese refuse to consider the Rohingya as an ethnic group and claim the name has been fabricated and used to win international support. Anti-Rohingya animosity is so strong that it can be felt ddown in the former capital, Rangoon, where discussions on the issue turn into rants about Burma's porous borders and a government that has been too soft on the \"illegal Bengalis\".</p><p>While the government has seemingly taken steps to address the issue, a Rakhine inquiry commission set up in August raised eyebrows after it emerged there was not a single Rohingya representative on the commission, yet its chairman, Aye Maung, heads the RNDP, and another of its representatives, Ko Ko Gyi, has previously stated that Rohingya are \"invading\" Burma.</p><p>Multiple allegations of abuse against Rohingya by security forces, including rape and torture, have been lodged with human rights groups, who have expressed concern about the prevalence of Muslims in detention. According to official figures released last week, more than 1,100 suspects have been detained in connection with this year's violence, three-quarters of whom are Rohingya.</p><p>Abu Tahay, of the Rohingya political group National Democratic Party for Development, says the authorities have acted without warrants and Rohingya detainees have been held without bail or access to lawyers.</p><p>The Burmese government has been quick to deny international media reports of genocide and has described the situation as an intercommunal conflict caused by underdevelopment in the state. Last month President Thein Sein promised that his government would look at a range of solutions – among them resettlement and citizenship – in what has become Burma's most pressing conflict since its transition to democracy last year.</p><p>Local immigration authorities recently began the mammoth task of verifying the citizenship of Rakhine's Muslim population in an effort to settle the explosive question. While some Rohingya hold temporary registration cards that grant them the right to vote but little else, citizenship revolves around a contentious 1982 law requiring proof that the past three generations of an applicant's family have lived in Burma. It is a touchy subject for Rohingya, many of whom lack any documentation but insist that their ancestors were born and bred in the state.</p><p>The census is expected to continue until 2014, although it is still unclear whether Buddhist and Muslim communities will be expected to live together once more or will continue to be segregated. It is also unknown what will happen to those who are incapable of providing documentation.</p><p>Swire – who initially travelled to Burma to lead a trade delegation – said \"conditions [in Rakhine] remain extremely worrying\" and stressed that without greater determination and urgent action \"this tragedy will continue to deepen for all concerned\".</p><p>To date, Aung San Suu Kyi – who is considered internationally as Burma's most unifying political figure and who has previously stressed the significance of ethnic rights – has been largely absent from debates on the issue and it is unclear why she has not played a greater role.</p><p>However, analysts largely believe <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2012/10/28/myanmars-ethnic-violence-where-is-suu-kyi/\" title=\"\">her reticence</a> may stem from a political desire to maintain majority Burman votes for her NLD party, particularly in the runup to the 2015 parliamentary elections.</p><p>According to Swire, who briefly met Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the Rohingya issue, the Nobel laureate is prepared to help in the reconciliation process if invited by the Burmese government to do so. \"[Suu Kyi] herself has been very clear about this– she is extremely busy. She can't do everything in this country,\" said Swire. \"If she is formally invited to get involved, she has indicated to me that she would be very willing to do that.\"</p><p>With aid workers expecting Rakhine's refugee camps to remain in place for at least another year, it seems many Rohingya are still at the mercy of the Burmese government and the few media and foreign dignitaries able to visit.</p><p>When one teary-eyed Rohingya man pleaded with Zaw Winn, telling him, \"We are real Rohingya – please recognise us\", the minister looked at his colleague and laughed.</p><p>So iIt is perhaps no surprise that, at the end of the tour of Pauktaw, a few brave Rohingya slipped handwritten letters into the hands of the delegation, including one to the Guardian that read: \"We are real citizens of Burma … We hope that you will save and rescue [us].\"</p><h2>Who are the Rohingya?</h2><p>• The Rohingya are an 800,000-strong Muslim minority in Rakhine state, western Burma, which borders Bangladesh. Though many claim to have lived in Burma for generations, they are not recognised as one of the country's 135 ethnic groups.</p><p>•A document on Burmese languages dating back to 1799 refers to \"Rooinga\" as \"natives of Arakan [Rakhine]\", but it is widely believed that most Rohingya came over from Bangladesh around 1821, when Britain annexed Burma as a province of British India and brought over migrant Muslim labourers.</p><p>• Large-scale Burmese-government crackdowns on the Rohingya, including Operation Dragon King in 1978, and Operation Clean and Beautiful Nation in 1991, forced hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh. Thousands of others have also left for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, many of them by boat.</p><p>• This latest crisis to befall Rakhine state, which has seen 200 killed and 115,000 displaced – most of them Rohingya – tests Burma's recent transition to democracy and its commitment to establishing full human rights for those within its borders.</p>","headline":"Trapped inside Burma's refugee
