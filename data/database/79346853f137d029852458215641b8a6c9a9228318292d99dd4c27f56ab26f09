This relates to the SMP programme which sees the ECB buy a troubled nations’s debt to bring down its borrowing costs.  Because of strict rules prohibiting the ECB from monetising governments, the amount spent on the SMP has to be “sterilised” –  the sum spent on SMP has to be withdrawn from the EZ system normally weekly.</p><p> This is unlike in the UK and US where QE has injected trillions into the banking systems. Ending the liquidity drain would add almost €180bn to Euro system.  That would be a big boost to money supply and could counteract deflation. </p><p>Bloomberg reports that “The Bundesbank supports ending the liquidity absorption and has deliberated on the measure in the ECB’s monetary-policy and market-operations committees”.

Another option would be to start charging banks who leave funds with the ECB, imposing negative interest rates on them in a bid to drive more credit into the system.</p><p>Another option is to end the process \"sterilising\" the bond purchases which the ECB made earlier in the crisis -- basically deciding to stop taking money out of the system to balance the funds which it had put in. That would create an infusion of liquidity, and there have been signals this week that Germany's Bundesbank would support the idea.</p><p>If that's all too dramatic for the ECB today, Draghi could make some dovish noises about easing policy in future. At Davos last week he (re)floated the idea of securitising loans to small European firms (<i>bundling them together into new securities</i>). Perhaps we'll hear more about that, <b>at 1.30pm GMT</b>.<br></p><p><b>The Bank of England </b>is unlikely to provide any drama, given its existing forward guidance that the jobs market isn't strong enough to support an interest rate rise. But there's always the chance that it might release a statement....</p><p>Ahead of these meetings, we're expecting Europe's stock markets to bounce back after recent losses.

Now, even a key former United States official, the economist Larry Summers, is warning of secular stagnation.</p><p>The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that, in a fundamental sense, the US economy was sick even before the crisis: it was only an asset-price bubble, created through lax regulation and low interest rates, that had made the economy seem robust.</p><p>Beneath the surface, numerous problems were festering: growing inequality; an unmet need for structural reform (moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages); persistent global imbalances; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs, increase productivity, and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns.</p><p>Policymakers' response to the crisis failed to address these issues; worse, it exacerbated some of them and created new ones – and not just in the US. The result has been increased indebtedness in many countries, as the collapse of GDP undermined government revenues. Moreover, underinvestment in both the public and private sector has created a generation of young people who have spent years idle and increasingly alienated at a point in their lives when they should have been honing their skills and increasing their productivity.</p><p>On both sides of the Atlantic, GDP is likely to grow considerably faster this year than in 2013. But, before leaders who embraced austerity policies open the champagne and toast themselves, they should examine where we are and consider the near-irreparable damage that these policies have caused.</p><p>Every downturn eventually comes to an end. The mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been. The mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary, with long-lasting consequences.</p><p>Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita is lower in most of the North Atlantic than it was in 2007; in Greece, the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23%. Germany, the top-performing European country, has recorded miserly 0.7% average annual growth over the last six years. The US economy is still roughly 15% smaller than it would have been had growth continued even on the moderate pre-crisis trajectory.</p><p>But even these numbers do not tell the full story of how bad things are, because GDP is not a good measure of success. Far more relevant is what is happening to household incomes. Median real income in the US is below its level in 1989, a quarter-century ago; median income for full-time male workers is lower now than it was more than 40 years ago.</p><p>Some, like the economist Robert Gordon, have suggested that we should adjust to a new reality in which long-term productivity growth will be significantly below what it has been over the past century. Given economists' miserable record – reflected in the run-up to the crisis – for even three-year predictions, no one should have much confidence in a crystal ball that forecasts decades into the future. But this much seems clear: unless government policies change, we are in for a long period of disappointment.</p><p>Markets are not self-correcting. The underlying fundamental problems that I outlined earlier could get worse – and many are. Inequality leads to weak demand; widening inequality weakens demand even more; and, in most countries, including the US, the crisis has only worsened inequality.</p><p>The trade surpluses of northern Europe have increased, even as China's have moderated. Most important, markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing, for example, was anything but smooth; on the contrary, it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the Great Depression.</p><p>This time is no different, but in some ways it could be worse: the sectors that should be growing, reflecting the needs and desires of citizens, are services like education and health, which traditionally have been publicly financed, and for good reason. But, rather than government facilitating the transition, austerity is inhibiting it.</p><p>Malaise is better than a recession, and a recession is better than a depression. But the difficulties that we are facing now are not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, as we would to a natural disaster, like an earthquake or tsunami. They are not even a kind of penance that we have to pay for past sins – though, to be sure, the neoliberal policies that have prevailed for the past three decades have much to do with our current predicament.</p><p>Instead, our current difficulties are the result of flawed policies. There are alternatives. But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites, whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring. Only some people, it seems, must adjust to a permanently lower standard of living. Unfortunately, those people happen to be most people.</p><p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2014.</p>","headline":"The current economic malaise is the result of flawed policies","trailText":"<strong>Joseph Stiglitz</strong>: It is not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, or even a penance for past sins","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg9h","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391691507898/New-York-City-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391691507898/New-York-City-003.jpg","wordcount":"873","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429063304","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652322","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Joseph Stiglitz","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039273","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:59:25Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/06/current-economic-malaise-flawed-policies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/06/current-economic-malaise-flawed-policies","tags":[{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics-blog","webTitle":"Economics blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog","references":[]},{"id":"business/global-economy","webTitle":"Global economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/global-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/global-economy","references":[]},{"id":"business/series/project-syndicate-economists","webTitle":"Project Syndicate economists","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/project-syndicate-economists","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/series/project-syndicate-economists","references":[]},{"id":"profile/josephstiglitz","webTitle":"Joseph Stiglitz","rcsId":"GNL507624","r2ContributorId":"15914","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/joseph_stiglitz_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Joseph E.

In the UK, Vodafone added a net 191,000 contract customers in the December quarter, but revenues fell 5% due to competition and regulatory price cuts.</p><p>\"The environment in Europe remains challenging and we have continued to experience intense macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures in the quarter,\" said chief executive Vittorio Colao. \"The shift to 4G is gaining momentum and we have seen improving mobile customer net addition trends.

Losses in the TV business have long dogged its efforts to compete with global consumer electronics giants like Apple and Samsung.</p><p>With restructuring costs rising at the same time as core mobile and home entertainment businesses fall short of its expectations, Sony said it now forecasts a net loss of ¥110bn in the fiscal year ending in March. It previously expected a net profit of ¥30bn.</p><p>The job cuts, which will come in both TV and PC divisions, are to be implemented by March 2015. The cost savings are to kick in by the 2015-2016 financial year, Sony said.</p><p>Sony said the Vaio PC division, as widely expected, will be sold to investment fund Japan Industrial Partners, which will set up a separate company to take over the operations. Financial terms of the sale weren't disclosed, but Sony will initially hold a 5% stake in that company.</p><p>The TV operations will be spun off into a separate unit by July 2014, Sony said.</p><p>Having last turned an annual operating profit in the 12 months ended March 2004, Sony's TV business piled up losses of ¥761.9bn in the nine fiscal years before the current one.

Bombardier – the British arm of the Canadian aerospace and transport manufacturer – had warned that missing out on the contract could cause the factory, which employs 1,500 workers, to close.</p><p>The deal, which also includes building a new depot, will support 760 UK manufacturing jobs and 80 apprenticeships. It will keep an estimated 74% of the contract spend in the UK.</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport announced the politically charged decision on Thursday morning.</p><p>Bombardier missed out on the UK's last big train contract to build rolling stock for the upgrade to London's Thameslink network. The £1.6bn commission went to Germany's Siemens in 2011, prompting Bombardier to cut 1,200 jobs at its plant.</p><p>Following the uproar over the Thameslink contract, the government pledged to put British manufacturers on an \"equal footing\" with overseas competition but ministers remained constrained by European Union rules.</p><p>Andrew Wolstenholme, chief executive of Crossrail, said: \"Crossrail will transform rail services in London and the south-east. Procurement of the rolling stock and depot is just one more step in delivering this new railway and making it a reality for millions of passengers.</p><p>\"Crossrail Limited has conducted this procurement in a fair, objective and transparent manner and in full compliance with the regulatory framework.\"</p><p>If the contract had gone to a foreign bidder it would have been a severe embarrassment to the government and its efforts to encourage manufacturing. George Osborne declared a \"march of the makers\" in 2011 that was undermined by Siemens winning the Thameslink contract.</p><p>The £15bn Crossrail project will connect London's suburbs to the east and west, running through the centre of the city to increase rail capacity by 10%. London's already overcrowded transport system is set to face further demands as the population grows by an expected 1.6 million to 10 million over the next 15 years.</p><p>Bombardier has promised that at least 25% of the value of the contract will go to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Business secretary Vince Cable has consistently called for more support for SMEs, which make up more than half the UK economy.</p><p>TfL will start running the new trains from May 2017 on the existing rail network ahead of services starting on Crossrail's central section in December 2018.</p><p>Cable said: \"As well as providing a great boost to Bombardier and the Midlands this decision represents a real vote of confidence in British manufacturing. The government has been working hard with industry to support the UK rail supply chain to maximise growth opportunities through contracts like this. Our industrial strategy is giving business the confidence to invest – securing high-skilled jobs and a stronger economy.\"</p>","headline":"Bombardier UK wins £1bn Crossrail contract","trailText":"Derby-based train builder beats Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3v","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","wordcount":"473","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429037808","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652056","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sean Farrell","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039094","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T08:28:07Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","tags":[{"id":"business/bombardier","webTitle":"Bombardier","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bombardier","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bombardier","references":[]},{"id":"business/manufacturing-sector","webTitle":"Manufacturing sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/manufacturing-sector","references":[]},{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/transport","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/crossrail","webTitle":"Crossrail","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/crossrail","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/derby","webTitle":"Derby","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/derby","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429038409","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674920650/Bombadier-factory-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Christopher Furlong","altText":"Bombadier factory","height":"54","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","caption":"Bombadier had warned that failure to win the Crossrail contract could mean the closure of the Derby factory and the loss of up to 1,500 jobs.

plants</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-02-06T03:02:28.172Z","body":"<p>Three hundred Ford workers will lose their jobs in June when the car company reduces production at its Victorian manufacturing plants as it prepares to cease manufacturing.</p><p>Ford Australia’s director of communications, Wes Sherwood, said the company briefed union representatives and its manufacturing team on Thursday morning.</p><p>\"We are continuing to match production with demand and that will mean we are reducing production by about a third in June with related job losses,\" Sherwood said.</p><p>He said the number of job losses would be in line with the level of production, meaning about 300 positions.</p><p>\"We'll continue to work with the teams to get into the exact details but it will be about 300,\" he said.</p><p>Workers at the manufacturing plants in Geelong and Broadmeadows, in Melbourne's north, will be affected.</p><p>Sherwood said the exact numbers at each site were still being worked out.</p><p>Ford announced last May that it would cease local manufacturing in October 2016, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs at its Broadmeadows plant and 510 at the Geelong plant.</p><p>At the time Ford Australia president and CEO Bob Graziano said the cost of manufacturing cars in Australia was uncompetitive.</p><p>Sherwood said Ford currently had about 1,500 salaried employees including 1,000 engineers.</p><p>He said even with it ceasing local manufacturing in 2016, the company would be Australia's biggest automotive employer, given moves by other carmakers.</p><p>\"We expect by the end of the decade to be the largest automotive employer in the country,\" he said.</p><p>Ford will manufacture its Falcon and Territory models in Victoria until 2016.</p><p>Sherwood said the carmaker was committed to its plan to transform its Australian business, which included refocusing and expanding its entire line-up for customers by 2017.</p><p>\"We are on track for the launch of our new Falcon and Territory later this year,\" he said.</p><p>Sherwood said the market was shifting towards smaller vehicles, with demand for larger cars in decline.</p><p>\"We're just going to have to match production with demand.</p><p>\"Obviously there's been some cases where others have taken some pretty aggressive action in the marketplace, really discounting their vehicles to levels that are unprecedented.\"</p><p>The Victorian attorney general, Robert Clark, said he was yet to receive details of the Ford announcement.</p><p>\"I don't have full details, but the government remains committed to support Ford workers going forward as we have to date, as indeed to support all the workers in the car industry,\" Clark said.</p>","headline":"Ford confirms 300 jobs will be cut in June as it prepares for closure","trailText":"300 jobs will be cut in June, says Fairfax Radio, as Ford prepares to stop manufacturing cars

And while they drop off their kids and wave goodbye at the classroom door, the parents might also feel some trepidation when they think about the costs to be paid over the following 13 years.</p><p>Thanks to the<a href=\"http://www.asg.com.au/Page.aspx?ID=5506\"> Australian Scholarships Group</a> (ASG), those parents can now have a pretty good idea. And for some, it’s going to be a fair lump of money.</p><p>The figures released by the ASG cover the cost of education from preschool through to year 12 in each state in government, Catholic and private (non-Catholic) schools.  Not surprisingly, those parents sending their kids to private schools will be expected to pay the most. For children starting preschool this year, the ASG estimates it will cost $367,569 to put them through till the end of secondary school. That figure include fees, extracurricular activities, clothing, necessities and computer and internet access.</p><p>For those going through the Catholic system the cost is around half the non-Catholic school cost, coming in at $186,641. Meanwhile, those starting preschool this year at a government school can expect to have cost their parents around $57,455 by the time they get to the stage of wondering whether or not Dad will let them go to schoolies on the Gold Coast (speaking for myself, the answer will be, “no”) .</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Metropolitan schooling costs for a child starting school in 2014\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/ZWRvM/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/ZWRvM/2/\">Click here to see on mobile.</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>If $367,000 sounds like a lot of money, the parents of that child starting preschool can at least be thankful they have not just given birth to a child this year. The ASG estimate that by the time a child born in 2014 starts school, it will cost up to $458,995 to attend a private non-Catholic school.</p><p>Over the next four years, ASG expects the cost of education to go up by around 25% for private schools, 23% for Catholic schools and 10% for government schools.</p><p>While in the non-government schools the biggest increases in costs are expected in the secondary school years, for government schools, the major increase in costs is expected to occur in the preschool year.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Increase in schooling costs for a child starting school in 2018 compared to starting in 2014\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/MQFPd/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/MQFPd/2/\">Click here to see on mobile.</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>This increase in costs is not surprising, for over the past decade education fees have increased almost as greatly as any other household expense. Since 2003, only the price of tobacco as well as electricity, gas, water and sewerage have increased by more than the fees for secondary education.  The fees for primary education come in as the eighth biggest price increase, with tertiary education just outside the top 10 in twelfth place.</p><p>If we compare various education expenses with other standard family expenses such as health costs, housing prices, rent and childcare, school fees rises have over the past decade generally outstripped them all.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Price increase of education compared to other common expenses\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/gZsaZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/gZsaZ/1/\">Click here to see on mobile. </a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Not surprisingly, the price rises have also varied across the country. However perhaps surprisingly, Perth and not Sydney is the capital city that has experienced the greatest increase in such prices since 2003.</p><p>While Sydney ranks second in overall increase in the price of education, most of that can be placed on the increase in the fees of attending tertiary education in Sydney compared to other capital cities. The price of primary education fees in Perth since 2003 have increased a whopping 113%, far outstripping the 83% increase that occurred in Adelaide and Brisbane in that time.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Increase in education fees since December 2003 by capital city\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/bqN9D/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/bqN9D/1/\">Click here to see on mobile. </a></figcaption> </figure> <p>This increase in expense, however, brings with it more than just the question of how to pay for your child’s education. Choosing to send your child to private school remains a choice. No one forces you to outlay over $350,000.  But because of the growth in private education over the past decade, and the increase in prices far in excess of overall inflation, education has grown in the level of importance in our annual spending.</p><p>In 2000, the ABS’s basket of goods used to calculate inflation had education spending accounting for 2.69% of the average household’s annual spend. By 2005, this had increased slightly to 2.73%; the latest weighting, calculated in 2011, has it up to 3.18%.</p><p>While this suggests we are spending more than ever before on education for our children (and ourselves), it also means that less of our money is being spent on items that are covered by the GST.</p><p>Increases in the amount we spend on non-GST services – such as education – is the main reason why our tax base is said to be shrinking. In the first few years of the GST it took in just over 16% of all revenue gathered by the government. Now it only accounts for around 14%. That means the government must depend on the less predictable income and company taxes.</p><p>And as last week’s release of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/03/billions-lost-tax-concessions-hypocrisy-aid\"> 2013-14 tax expenditures</a> showed, the exemption of education fees from the GST cost the government $3.3bn in revenue.</p><p>Normally broadening the GST would be a regressive measure, however as is expected, the wealthier households spend more of their income on education than poorer ones.</p><p>The<a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6530.02009-10?OpenDocument\"> ABS found</a> that in 2009-10, while the wealthiest 20% of households spent 2.3% of their annual expenditure on primary and secondary school fees, the poorest 20% spent only 0.35%:</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of annual expenditure spent on education by household income quintile\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/6kCVj/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/6kCVj/1/\">Click here to see on mobile. </a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Thus broadening the GST to include education would be a quite progressive measure.</p><p>But it would also be deeply unpopular.</p><p>Not only would the government have to overcome voters’ usual displeasure with any tax increases, the independent and Catholic schools would go on a warpath not seen since Mark Latham school’s hit list. It would also likely see the wrath of all sides of politics who would claim the tax was an attack on education.</p><p>And so we shall continue to see school fees rise well above wages and other prices. As a result we’ll spend more than ever before on education, both personally and no doubt through our taxes. And all the while our tax base will continue to narrow due to that very expense.</p>","headline":"Paying GST on education would be an unpopular but progressive move","trailText":"Exempting education from the GST is costing the government $3.3bn and doing nothing to stop the rising cost of school fees ","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgve","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391650181074/f3ac5fca-59db-48cc-a947-13d9e9d2281b-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391650181074/f3ac5fca-59db-48cc-a947-13d9e9d2281b-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1002","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429022076","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2d8d1e4b0530e249db022","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Greg Jericho","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039027","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:45:26+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/06/paying-gst-education-unpopular-but-progressive","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/06/paying-gst-education-unpopular-but-progressive","tags":[{"id":"business/grogonomics","webTitle":"Grogonomics","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia-economy","webTitle":"Australia economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia-economy","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-education","webTitle":"Australian education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-education","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-education","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/gst-australia","webTitle":"GST (Goods and Services Tax)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gst-australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/gst-australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/greg-jericho","webTitle":"Greg Jericho","r2ContributorId":"56591","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/22/1369191059253/Greg-Jericho2.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/greg-jericho","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/greg-jericho","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-1b51d541-9066-40c3-8d66-f027ac125647","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391650180520/4504239e-c0df-4000-8e4d-8cea1b58bd25-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391650180520/4504239e-c0df-4000-8e4d-8cea1b58bd25-220x132.jpeg","source":"Dan Peled","altText":"backpacks","height":"132","credit":"Dan Peled","caption":"Parents can expect to pay more than $367,000 to put their child through Australia's private school system.

That was the message from the state of the nation report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies.</p><p>Real incomes, once changes to prices, taxes and benefits are taken into account, are 6% below their pre-crisis peak. Public borrowing this year is projected to be £111bn, 7% of national income, and interest payments on the national debt will be a drain on the exchequer for years to come.</p><p>Those Whitehall departments not protected by the coalition's ring fence will see a cut of more than 30% in their budgets between 2010-11 and 2018-19 if George Osborne sticks to his plan to continue austerity deep into the next parliament. And that assumes he finds an additional £12bn from the welfare budget.</p><p>Nor is it a bed of roses for those parts of public spending spared the axe. A rising and ageing population means, according to the IFS, that real age-related per capita spending on the NHS&nbsp;will be 9% lower in 2018-19 than it was when David Cameron came to power.</p><p>There's more that the IFS did not mention in its green budget.</p><p>Business investment as a share of GDP in the UK is one of the lowest in the western world, and once replacement of obsolete machinery is taken into account it is not really rising much at all. To cap it all, the balance of payments is in the red by more than 5% of GDP.</p><p>Certain conclusions can be drawn from all this. Osborne is clearly right when he says that Britain's deep-rooted problems have not disappeared as a result of a few quarters of decent growth. The recession highlighted structural weaknesses that have been worsening over many decades and the UK now has a severe twin-deficit problem that makes the pound look over-valued and vulnerable.</p><p>Unless and until a more sustainable economic model is developed consumer-led growth will only shrink the budget deficit at the expense of a bigger trade deficit. But the main conclusion from the IFS report is this: the great recession has left Britain a much poorer country. It cannot afford another one.</p>","headline":"Recession has left Britain a much poorer country, says IFS","trailText":"<strong>Larry Elliott: </strong>State of the nation report shows real incomes 6%

The qualification flows from the allegation that GSK's Chinese unit was paying bribes to doctors on a huge scale. The Chinese authorities' investigation, now eight months old, is still described as \"ongoing\" so it is impossible to guess how painful any charges, sanctions or a settlement will be, or whether the US Department for Justice and our own Serious Fraud Office will enter the fray.</p><p>The only mildly encouraging development for GSK is that the Chinese state authorities do not appear to have unofficially banned the company's medicines and vaccines. GSK's sales in China in the fourth quarter were down 29% versus 2012's level, a veritable triumph against the 61% plunge in the third quarter.</p><p>China aside, GSK's giant wheels are turning in the right direction, albeit slowly. Group turnover has stopped falling. It was minus 3% in 2011 then minus 2% in 2012 but improved 1% in 2013 with plus 2% forecast for 2014.</p><p>And one of these years chief executive Sir Andrew Witty may be able to declare that his target for return on investment in the labs has been met.</p><p>Investors in drug companies have long grumbled that billions of dollars are spent every year on research and development without any measure being taken of value for money.</p><p>Admirably, Witty tried in 2010 to counter the complaint by publishing data. GSK's rate of return has now improved to 13%, he estimates, a percentage point short of his goal.</p><p>The fruits were approvals for six major products in 2013 – including two for respiratory disease and two for melanoma. GSK can now boast that since 2009 it has had more new medicines approved in the US than any competitor.</p><p>It all helps to explain why the shares had a strong run until the Chinese scandal broke. This is a company that is managing to run slightly faster than its patents expire while still generating a lot of surplus cash. The dividend yield is 5% and the rolling share buy-back programme saw £1.5bn of shares purchased last year.

'green budget' finds national debt will only return to pre-crisis levels in the mid-2030s","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-06T00:05:48Z","body":"<p>Britain's public services can expect to suffer unprecedented cuts over the next five years despite the improving economy as the next government is forced to find further savings, a leading thinktank has warned,</p><p>A resurgence in growth during 2013 and predictions that the recovery will accelerate this year will not spare the post-2015 administration from having to make the deepest cuts since 1948 across Whitehall, local government and the welfare budget, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p><p>But the IFS said the housing market has not entered bubble territory, even in London, and expects the economy to rebalance towards business investment and exports next year, supporting the government view that the consumer-driven recovery will fade, to be replaced by stronger support from business spending.</p><p>Evidence that a 10.4% rise in house prices last year – three times the rate of inflation – had sparked feverish demand for homes, especially in London and the south-east, was dismissed by the IFS in its annual \"green budget\", which analyses the state of the economy and public finances.</p><p>It said prices remained below the long-term trend and were likely to remain subdued while transactions steadily recover.</p><p>The analysis is likely to stir up controversy after George Osborne told a parliamentary committee that a shortfall in housing would continue for at least 10 years, adding to fears that prices will soon get out of control. In a period of austerity, sharply rising house prices and rents will add to household costs and prevent living standards from recovering.</p><p>The chancellor extended austerity to 2018-19 in his autumn statement after lower-than-expected growth reduced tax receipts and swelled the welfare budget. The IFS said the extension means that by the end of this financial year, 60% of planned spending cuts will be yet to come. The ambitious scale of cuts would put the UK on course to have a budget surplus by 2018-19, its first since 2000-01, but national debt would still be 76% of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>The IFS said that even with the scale of cuts planned, national debt would only return to pre-crisis levels in the mid-2030s.</p><p>Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said it would be possible to achieve a budget surplus in the annual accounts in 2018, but only by imposing an extra 30% of cuts on \"unprotected\" areas of spending, excluding schools and health.</p><p>\"Returning growth, and forecasts suggesting we should be running a budget surplus by 2018-19, should not lull us into a false sense that all is now well with the public finances,\" he said.</p><p>\"The outstanding debt will still be very large and the scale of additional spending cuts required to hit that budget surplus remains hugely challenging, especially on top of cuts already delivered. A combination of significant additional spending pledges already made and a growing and ageing population will only add to the challenge.\"</p><p>The IFS said that as a result of population growth, public service spending per head would fall by 2.4% a year between 2010 and 2018.</p><p>It added that even if the overall NHS budget continues to be frozen in real terms, real age-adjusted health spending per person would be 9% lower in 2018–19 than in 2010–11 because of the rising number of over-65s.</p><p>More than two million extra 65-year-olds will qualify for the state pension in 2018 compared with 2010. A dramatic rise in the number of pensioners is due to place a greater strain on public services alongside a broader jump in the population, which is expected to rise by 3.5 million over the same period.</p><p>Osborne has given himself additional problems, following his commitment to spend more than £6bn a year after 2015–16 – implying additional cuts elsewhere.</p><p>Even with £12bn a year of additional spending cuts to social security spending, Osborne's plans would imply cuts in \"unprotected\" public service budgets of more than 30% since 2010, the independent thinktank said. The chancellor has ringfenced health, education and international aid spending from cuts.</p><p>Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, criticised some of the policy moves being considered by the main political parties ahead of the general election next year, including additional spending on childcare and income tax cuts.</p><p>\"Despite the state of the public finances, tax cuts and spending increases are being considered by government and opposition. They seem agreed in promising additional spending on childcare despite a remarkable lack of evidence as to its effectiveness.</p><p>\"They seem equally set on further cuts in income tax either through more increases in the personal allowance or the introduction of a 10p starting rate. Either could be expensive and would be poorly targeted on the low paid.\"</p><p>The IFS report outlined the scale of the challenge still ahead for the UK economy, despite a return to growth. <a

The currency probe comes as regulators are still investigating the manipulation of the Libor lending rate by traders at some of the world’s biggest banks.</p><p>Reuters revealed on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank had fired three New York-based currency traders amid signs of a widening investigation. \"Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory authorities that are investigating trading in the foreign exchange market,\" a bank spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \"The bank is co-operating with those investigations, and will take disciplinary action with regards to individuals if merited.\"</p><p>On Wednesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs’ Steven Cho, formerly global head of spot and forward foreign exchange trading for major currencies, was retiring from the bank. His departure came a day after Citigroup announced that Anil Prasad, its global head of foreign exchange, was leaving the company. It is not know if his retirement is in any way linked to any investigation.</p><p>Citigroup, JP Morgan and others have confirmed they are co-operating with investigations. </p><p>A Citi source told Reuters that the departure of Prasad, who was based in London, was unrelated to any ongoing currency market investigation. </p><p>Prasad’s exit comes a month after Rohan Ramchandani, formerly Citi’s head of European spot foreign exchange trading, was fired. Ramchandani had been a member of the Bank of England’s foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for discussing market issues. The reasons for his dismissal were unknown.</p><p>Lawsky is one of the world’s most powerful regulators and has authority over financial institutions chartered in New York state, including many non-US banks that do business in the country.</p><p>Appointed in 2011, Lawsky rose to prominence after accusing Standard Chartered of orchestrating an illegal money-laundering operation, and threatening to revoke its New York banking licence. News of the investigation triggered a 23% drop in Standard Chartered’s share price and ended with the bank paying a $340m fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services.</p><p>Lawsky’s probe into the FX markets is not the only one under way. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US Department of Justice are also conducting investigations. Swiss regulators are also looking at the markets, and are thought to be focusing on the “fix” – a figure used to price a number of financial products such as funds for private investors.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/financial-conduct-authority-libor-abuse-market-rates-london\">FCA chief Martin Wheatley said this week </a>that he was examining possible abuse of London-based market rates.

Given what has come out, no, people won't trust the way rates are fixed,\" Wheatley told a Treasury select committee this week.</p><p>Lloyds Banking Group is believed to have been contacted. RBS declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank. Standard Chartered could not immediately be reached.

Anders Bouvin, chief executive of the UK arm of the bank, which does not pay bonuses, said the past decision by HM Revenue &amp; Customs that has effectively blocked payments to the UK bank's share scheme for staff could have \"business consequences\".</p><p>The scheme, known as the Oktogonen foundation, which Bouvin called the \"glue\" of the bank, allocates shares to staff that they receive at the age of 60. Since 2010, UK employees have not received their allocations as the tax authorities changed the rules so that they needed to pay tax when the share awards are made, not on receipt at age 60.</p><p>\"That is a big source of frustration to us,\" said Bouvin.</p><p>The UK is the fastest-growing part of Handelsbanken's operations, with 161 branches, up from 133 since the beginning of last year, during which time it increased its lending by 20%.</p><p>The overall bank <a href=\"http://www.handelsbanken.com/shb/inet/icentsv.nsf/vlookuppics/investor_relations_en_hb_q4_13_eng_report/$file/hb_q4_13_eng_report.pdf\" title=\"\">reported</a> operating profits of Skr18bn (£1.7bn), some Skr1.1bn of which came from the UK.</p><p>The bank gives its branch managers responsibility for lending decisions and does not have centralised call centres. But it also does not have formal rates for loans or savings, and deposits are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, although they are covered up to €100,000 by the Swedish equivalent.</p>","headline":"Handelsbanken boss frustrated by tax treatment of share scheme","trailText":"HMRC has effectively blocked payments to the UK bank's share scheme for staff","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfz6","wordcount":"247","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429005019","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8649654","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jill Treanor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038938","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T19:06:34Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/05/handelsbanken-boss-tax-hmrc-share-scheme","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/05/handelsbanken-boss-tax-hmrc-share-scheme","tags":[{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/financial-sector","references":[]},{"id":"money/employeebenefits","webTitle":"Employee benefits","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/employeebenefits","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/employeebenefits","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"politics/hmrc","webTitle":"HMRC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/hmrc","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/hmrc","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

prosecutor tells jury that three executives flouted the rules in lending hundreds of millions of euros to 16 people","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-02-06T00:05:48Z","body":"<p>Former executives at the Anglo Irish Bank broke company law and carried out lending practices that were \"absolutely illegal\", a Dublin court heard on Wednesday.</p><p>Three ex-bosses flouted the rules when the now-defunct institution lent hundreds of millions of euros to 16 people in the summer of 2008 at a time when its share price had collapsed, the Irish state's prosecutor said.</p><p>On day one of the trial of former executives Sean FitzPatrick, William McAteer and Patrick Whelan, Paul O'Higgins, the senior counsel for the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions said the bank's lending to these individuals had \"nothing whatsoever to do\" with normal lending practices.</p><p>The trio all pleaded not guilty to charges that they had unlawfully provided financial assistance to the 16 individuals, who include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/03/sean-quinn-freed\" title=\"\">Ireland's one-time richest man, Sean Quinn</a>.</p><p>In his opening speech to the 15-strong jury – a historic first in juror numbers in Irish legal history – the state's lawyer said the bank was so desperate to get members of the Quinn family to borrow from it, even as it struggled for survival in the summer of 2008, that its executives followed some of the Quinn family to holidays in Portugal and the south of France.</p><p>O'Higgins told the trial that when holidaymakers saw their bank manager turning up at their resort they would be expected to \"run for the sand dunes\". But Anglo Irish bosses where so keen to convince the one-time tycoon's family to purchase the banks' shares with more borrowings that they went to resorts in the south of France and Portugal in 2008 to track them down, O'Higgins told the court. At the time Quinn and his companies already owed the bank over €2bn (£1.7bn) before they were offered more loans that summer, he said.</p><p>He said that around the time Anglo Irish Bank chiefs were offering the loans worth tens of millions of euros, the bank's share price had plunged from €17 per share in 2007 to €4.50 in the summer of 2008. The loans which the state says were illegal totalled €175m to the Quinn family and related companies, and €450m to the so-called Maple 10 group of Irish investors.</p><p>The trial in Dublin is likely to last up until 31 May, the court was told. It will hear from hundreds of witnesses and examine millions of documents. Quinn is a witness alongside several members of his family who will give evidence at one of the most complex and controversial trials in the history of European financial crime. There was no sign of any of the expected protests outside the court buildings close to the city's Phoenix Park on Wednesday  morning as the three former executives arrived.</p><p>The opening proceedings, in a packed  court No 19, were taken up with finding a 15th juror. At the start of the trial, the judge, Martin Nolan, told the courthouse he had received a letter from a male juror that led to him being relieved of his duties. The trial continues.</p>","headline":"Anglo Irish Bank chiefs' lending practices 'absolutely illegal', court told","trailText":"State prosecutor tells jury that three executives flouted the rules in

We will respond to what voters decide and governments agree,\" a spokesman for the bank, 81%-owned by the taxpayer, said. </p><p>But the senior banker supported Cable's remarks to MPs on the Commons business committee that RBS would move to London because only the UK would be strong enough to support a bank whose balance sheet is almost the same size as the UK economy and required a £45bn bailout. </p><p>\"If you were managing RBS, I think you would almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your bank is protected against the risk of collapse,\" Cable said.</p><p>\"They already have a substantial amount of their management in London and I would have thought, inevitably, they would become a London bank which would be symbolically quite important.\"</p><p>The decision would rest with the RBS board but could also involve intervention by the UK government if it still holds its stake in the bank in 2016 – the year Scotland is expected to declare independence if there is a yes vote. </p><p>Cable also said it was almost certain that an independent Scotland would need its own currency – the latest intervention following remarks by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, the chancellor George Osborne, and Bob Dudley, the chief executive of oil group BP, on the difficulties of agreeing a new currency union should Scotland vote for independence in September.</p><p>The business secretary told MPs that the problems setting up a viable sterling currency union between Scotland and the UK were so significant that Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, would need a Plan B to use a new or different currency.</p><p>\"The plan B is a fully separate ­currency,\" Cable said, signalling a hardening of the UK government's stance on the proposal. \"The logic of what the governor and other people have spelled out is that the problems of a currency union with an independent Scotland are so difficult, so tricky, that it would almost certainly prove to be in Scotland's interests – and indeed the rest of the UK – that Scotland did have its own currency.\"</p><p>The Scottish National party said it would be \"absurd\" for the UK to damage its trading links with an independent Scotland by failing to maintain a monetary union. </p><p>A spokesman for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \"The pound is as much Scotland's as it is the rest of the UK's, and the [Scottish government's] fiscal commission working group, with experts including two Nobel laureates, have concluded that it's in the interests of both Scotland and the UK to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary union.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Osborne again claimed that a currency union was highly unlikely, saying: \"I don't think a workable currency can be created.\" BP's Dudley this week voiced \"concern\" over Scotland's monetary future.</p><p>Carney said last week that the euro crisis had shown that a sterling pact would require stringent and mutually agreed policies to control the fiscal policies of both governments – a catch-up category covering taxation levels, state debt and government borrowing.</p>","headline":"Scottish independence:

This relates to the SMP programme which sees the ECB buy a troubled nations’s debt to bring down its borrowing costs.  Because of strict rules prohibiting the ECB from monetising governments, the amount spent on the SMP has to be “sterilised” –  the sum spent on SMP has to be withdrawn from the EZ system normally weekly.</p><p> This is unlike in the UK and US where QE has injected trillions into the banking systems. Ending the liquidity drain would add almost €180bn to Euro system.  That would be a big boost to money supply and could counteract deflation. </p><p>Bloomberg reports that “The Bundesbank supports ending the liquidity absorption and has deliberated on the measure in the ECB’s monetary-policy and market-operations committees”.

Another option would be to start charging banks who leave funds with the ECB, imposing negative interest rates on them in a bid to drive more credit into the system.</p><p>Another option is to end the process \"sterilising\" the bond purchases which the ECB made earlier in the crisis -- basically deciding to stop taking money out of the system to balance the funds which it had put in. That would create an infusion of liquidity, and there have been signals this week that Germany's Bundesbank would support the idea.</p><p>If that's all too dramatic for the ECB today, Draghi could make some dovish noises about easing policy in future. At Davos last week he (re)floated the idea of securitising loans to small European firms (<i>bundling them together into new securities</i>). Perhaps we'll hear more about that, <b>at 1.30pm GMT</b>.<br></p><p><b>The Bank of England </b>is unlikely to provide any drama, given its existing forward guidance that the jobs market isn't strong enough to support an interest rate rise. But there's always the chance that it might release a statement....</p><p>Ahead of these meetings, we're expecting Europe's stock markets to bounce back after recent losses.

Losses in the TV business have long dogged its efforts to compete with global consumer electronics giants like Apple and Samsung.</p><p>With restructuring costs rising at the same time as core mobile and home entertainment businesses fall short of its expectations, Sony said it now forecasts a net loss of ¥110bn in the fiscal year ending in March. It previously expected a net profit of ¥30bn.</p><p>The job cuts, which will come in both TV and PC divisions, are to be implemented by March 2015. The cost savings are to kick in by the 2015-2016 financial year, Sony said.</p><p>Sony said the Vaio PC division, as widely expected, will be sold to investment fund Japan Industrial Partners, which will set up a separate company to take over the operations. Financial terms of the sale weren't disclosed, but Sony will initially hold a 5% stake in that company.</p><p>The TV operations will be spun off into a separate unit by July 2014, Sony said.</p><p>Having last turned an annual operating profit in the 12 months ended March 2004, Sony's TV business piled up losses of ¥761.9bn in the nine fiscal years before the current one. Sony officials on Thursday said they expect to lose another ¥25bn on TVs this year.</p><p>Buoyed by a strong performance in its financial services unit in the October-December quarter, Sony posted an operating profit for the three months of ¥90.3bn, up from ¥46.43bn a year earlier. That was above a consensus forecasts of ¥71.9bn , the average of estimates from six analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.</p><p>But with core businesses like its smartphone, PCs, TVs and audio operations weaker than it expected through the first nine months of the fiscal year, Sony slashed its full-year operating profit forecast to ¥80bn from the ¥170bn it previously expected.</p>","headline":"Sony to axe 5,000 jobs in major restructuring as losses mount","trailText":"Sony quits personal computers business and splits off TV division as it warns it expects steep losses this year","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg37","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391676594799/Sony-Vaio-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391676594799/Sony-Vaio-006.jpg","wordcount":"351","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"429039984","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652048","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039101","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T08:51:42Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/06/sony-jobs-restructuring-losses-pc-tv","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/06/sony-jobs-restructuring-losses-pc-tv","tags":[{"id":"business/job-losses","webTitle":"Job losses","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/job-losses","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/job-losses","references":[]},{"id":"technology/sony","webTitle":"Sony","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/sony","references":[]},{"id":"business/technology","webTitle":"Technology sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/technology","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/technology","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"world/japan","webTitle":"Japan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/japan","references":[]},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/asia-pacific","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429040382","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391676584181/Sony-Vaio-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Yoshikazu Tsuno","altText":"Sony Vaio","height":"54","credit":"Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Sony's Vaio PC division will be sold to investment fund Japan Industrial Partners.

But shares fell sharply as the company announced it had 241m users at the end of 2013, just 9m higher than the previous quarter.</p><p>Twitter also disclosed that the number of “timeline views” – its equivalent of page views, and a key measure for advertisers – dropped for the first time in the last quarter of 2013 to 148bn from 159bn.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/statuses/431176064996372480\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Twitter Engagement: Q4’13 Timeline Views 148 billion, up 26% y/y. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TWTRearnings&amp;src=hash\">#TWTRearnings</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/JMwcymsmZx\">pic.twitter.com/JMwcymsmZx</a></p>&mdash; TwitterIR (@TwitterIR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/statuses/431176064996372480\">February 5, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>The fall came even as Twitter made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to Tweets. The moves were designed to improve “engagement” – a key measure for advertisers who want to people to spend time on a site. </p><p>According to the earnings report issued on Wednesday, in the three months to 31 December, the company had revenues of $242.7m, an increase of 116% compared to $112m in the same period last year. It made a net loss of $511m for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to a net loss of $9m in the same period last year.</p><p>Twitter said it expected first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $230m to $240m, with revenue for the year of between $1.15bn and $1.2bn, nearly double the $665m it posted in 2013.</p><p>\"Twitter finished a great year with our strongest financial quarter to date,\" said Dick Costolo, Twitter's CEO. \"We are the only platform that is public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed, and I'm excited by the number of initiatives we have underway to further build upon the Twitter experience.\"</p><p>In a conference call with analysts Costolo was quizzed about its slowing user numbers. He said the company was “doubling down on accelerating growth in our core user base” in 2014. Twitter has “massive global awareness” he said but needed to make it easier for new people to “get it”.</p><p>Costolo said changes to Twitter’s products had already made significant differences, increasing the numbers of retweets and favourites. “We believe combined changes over the course of the year will start to change the slope of the user growth curve,” he said. He said the company had a clear “roadmap” for growing user numbers. “I’m delighted with the early results,” he said.</p><p>Twitter went public last November and while its share price has soared, it has attracted some unusually negative coverage. Shares sold at $26 a share during the initial public offering and have traded as high as $74.73. They closed Wednesday at $66.21, before the earnings report was published.  In after-hours trading, the stock fell by as much as 17%,</p><p>Before the results were issued, 30% of the analysts following Twitter had posted sell ratings on the company’s stock, while 27% listed it as buys and 43% were neutral, according to analyst FactSet. By comparison, 89% of analysts following Facebook are recommending a buy and none are posting sell ratings. Sell notes account for just 6% of all the analyst recommendations covering the S&amp;P 500 list of the top US companies.<br></p><p>Analysts are concerned that Twitter’s growth is slowing and that while Twitter’s revenue is more than doubling each quarter, it has yet to make a profit. Shyam Patil, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said for many analysts the company’s share price had risen “too far too fast”.</p><p>Patil, who has a neutral rating on the company, said no new information had come out on the company before the quarterly results, and the share price had been driven up by expectations rather than facts. “I think it’s a good business. It is clearly differentiated from the competition,” he said. He said Twitter had yet to figure out how it was going to make money, and that at the moment the sky-high valuation was based on bets that it would hit on a lucrative plan.</p><p>“You could see an incredible house and think it’s worth half a million only to find out it’s being sold for $2m. It’s still a great house,” he said.</p><p>In recent months, Twitter has made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to tweets. The moves are designed to improve “engagement” – a key measure for advertisers who want to see their content favourited, retweeted and commented upon.</p><p>Twitter is still growing quickly. The disappointing quarterly figures still represents a 30% rise year on year. But it accounts for a very small portion of the overall digital ad market. Twitter accounted for 0.5% of global digital ad revenues in 2013, according to eMarketer, up compared to 0.3% in 2012. Facebook, by comparison, accounts for 5.7% of global digital ad spending. Google accounts for 32.4%.</p>","headline":"Twitter posts revenues of $242m but share price plummets as growth stalls","trailText":"Revenue increases 116% to exceed analysts' expectations but company adds just 9m users in final three months of 2013","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfq2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636521400/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636521400/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"827","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429014679","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f2ace1e4b0530e249db005","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dominic Rushe in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038988","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T16:45:59-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/05/twitter-revenues-share-price-drops","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/feb/05/twitter-revenues-share-price-drops","tags":[{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/social-media","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e1cb786f-5ac1-4b52-9bbb-09e5c44ada0c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636520850/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391636520850/e415f531-c507-4694-a1cb-6261c27b5ba0-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Justin Sullivan","altText":"Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.","height":"132","credit":"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","caption":"Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.

Now, even a key former United States official, the economist Larry Summers, is warning of secular stagnation.</p><p>The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that, in a fundamental sense, the US economy was sick even before the crisis: it was only an asset-price bubble, created through lax regulation and low interest rates, that had made the economy seem robust.</p><p>Beneath the surface, numerous problems were festering: growing inequality; an unmet need for structural reform (moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages); persistent global imbalances; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs, increase productivity, and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns.</p><p>Policymakers' response to the crisis failed to address these issues; worse, it exacerbated some of them and created new ones – and not just in the US. The result has been increased indebtedness in many countries, as the collapse of GDP undermined government revenues. Moreover, underinvestment in both the public and private sector has created a generation of young people who have spent years idle and increasingly alienated at a point in their lives when they should have been honing their skills and increasing their productivity.</p><p>On both sides of the Atlantic, GDP is likely to grow considerably faster this year than in 2013. But, before leaders who embraced austerity policies open the champagne and toast themselves, they should examine where we are and consider the near-irreparable damage that these policies have caused.</p><p>Every downturn eventually comes to an end. The mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been. The mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary, with long-lasting consequences.</p><p>Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita is lower in most of the North Atlantic than it was in 2007; in Greece, the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23%. Germany, the top-performing European country, has recorded miserly 0.7% average annual growth over the last six years. The US economy is still roughly 15% smaller than it would have been had growth continued even on the moderate pre-crisis trajectory.</p><p>But even these numbers do not tell the full story of how bad things are, because GDP is not a good measure of success. Far more relevant is what is happening to household incomes. Median real income in the US is below its level in 1989, a quarter-century ago; median income for full-time male workers is lower now than it was more than 40 years ago.</p><p>Some, like the economist Robert Gordon, have suggested that we should adjust to a new reality in which long-term productivity growth will be significantly below what it has been over the past century. Given economists' miserable record – reflected in the run-up to the crisis – for even three-year predictions, no one should have much confidence in a crystal ball that forecasts decades into the future. But this much seems clear: unless government policies change, we are in for a long period of disappointment.</p><p>Markets are not self-correcting. The underlying fundamental problems that I outlined earlier could get worse – and many are. Inequality leads to weak demand; widening inequality weakens demand even more; and, in most countries, including the US, the crisis has only worsened inequality.</p><p>The trade surpluses of northern Europe have increased, even as China's have moderated. Most important, markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing, for example, was anything but smooth; on the contrary, it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the Great Depression.</p><p>This time is no different, but in some ways it could be worse: the sectors that should be growing, reflecting the needs and desires of citizens, are services like education and health, which traditionally have been publicly financed, and for good reason. But, rather than government facilitating the transition, austerity is inhibiting it.</p><p>Malaise is better than a recession, and a recession is better than a depression. But the difficulties that we are facing now are not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, as we would to a natural disaster, like an earthquake or tsunami. They are not even a kind of penance that we have to pay for past sins – though, to be sure, the neoliberal policies that have prevailed for the past three decades have much to do with our current predicament.</p><p>Instead, our current difficulties are the result of flawed policies. There are alternatives. But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites, whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring. Only some people, it seems, must adjust to a permanently lower standard of living. Unfortunately, those people happen to be most people.</p><p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2014.</p>","headline":"The current economic malaise is the result of flawed policies","trailText":"<strong>Joseph Stiglitz</strong>: It is not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, or even a penance for past sins","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg9h","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391691507898/New-York-City-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391691507898/New-York-City-003.jpg","wordcount":"873","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429063304","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652322","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Joseph Stiglitz","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039273","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T12:59:25Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/06/current-economic-malaise-flawed-policies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/06/current-economic-malaise-flawed-policies","tags":[{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics-blog","webTitle":"Economics blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog","references":[]},{"id":"business/global-economy","webTitle":"Global economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/global-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/global-economy","references":[]},{"id":"business/series/project-syndicate-economists","webTitle":"Project Syndicate economists","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/project-syndicate-economists","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/series/project-syndicate-economists","references":[]},{"id":"profile/josephstiglitz","webTitle":"Joseph Stiglitz","rcsId":"GNL507624","r2ContributorId":"15914","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/joseph_stiglitz_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Joseph E.

Bombardier – the British arm of the Canadian aerospace and transport manufacturer – had warned that missing out on the contract could cause the factory, which employs 1,500 workers, to close.</p><p>The deal, which also includes building a new depot, will support 760 UK manufacturing jobs and 80 apprenticeships. It will keep an estimated 74% of the contract spend in the UK.</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport announced the politically charged decision on Thursday morning.</p><p>Bombardier missed out on the UK's last big train contract to build rolling stock for the upgrade to London's Thameslink network. The £1.6bn commission went to Germany's Siemens in 2011, prompting Bombardier to cut 1,200 jobs at its plant.</p><p>Following the uproar over the Thameslink contract, the government pledged to put British manufacturers on an \"equal footing\" with overseas competition but ministers remained constrained by European Union rules.</p><p>Andrew Wolstenholme, chief executive of Crossrail, said: \"Crossrail will transform rail services in London and the south-east. Procurement of the rolling stock and depot is just one more step in delivering this new railway and making it a reality for millions of passengers.</p><p>\"Crossrail Limited has conducted this procurement in a fair, objective and transparent manner and in full compliance with the regulatory framework.\"</p><p>If the contract had gone to a foreign bidder it would have been a severe embarrassment to the government and its efforts to encourage manufacturing. George Osborne declared a \"march of the makers\" in 2011 that was undermined by Siemens winning the Thameslink contract.</p><p>The £15bn Crossrail project will connect London's suburbs to the east and west, running through the centre of the city to increase rail capacity by 10%. London's already overcrowded transport system is set to face further demands as the population grows by an expected 1.6 million to 10 million over the next 15 years.</p><p>Bombardier has promised that at least 25% of the value of the contract will go to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Business secretary Vince Cable has consistently called for more support for SMEs, which make up more than half the UK economy.</p><p>TfL will start running the new trains from May 2017 on the existing rail network ahead of services starting on Crossrail's central section in December 2018.</p><p>Cable said: \"As well as providing a great boost to Bombardier and the Midlands this decision represents a real vote of confidence in British manufacturing. The government has been working hard with industry to support the UK rail supply chain to maximise growth opportunities through contracts like this. Our industrial strategy is giving business the confidence to invest – securing high-skilled jobs and a stronger economy.\"</p>","headline":"Bombardier UK wins £1bn Crossrail contract","trailText":"Derby-based train builder beats Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3v","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674933087/Bombadier-factory-006.jpg","wordcount":"473","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429037808","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652056","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sean Farrell","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039094","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T08:28:07Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/06/bombardier-uk-crossrail-trains-contract-derby","tags":[{"id":"business/bombardier","webTitle":"Bombardier","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bombardier","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bombardier","references":[]},{"id":"business/manufacturing-sector","webTitle":"Manufacturing sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/manufacturing-sector","references":[]},{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/transport","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/crossrail","webTitle":"Crossrail","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/crossrail","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/derby","webTitle":"Derby","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/derby","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/derby","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429038409","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391674920650/Bombadier-factory-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Christopher Furlong","altText":"Bombadier factory","height":"54","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","caption":"Bombadier had warned that failure to win the Crossrail contract could mean the closure of the Derby factory and the loss of up to 1,500 jobs.

Those who had bought would be able to clear their mortgage by 60, while property have-nots would only pay it off at 67.</p><p></p><p>Of those who had bought, two-thirds had help from their parents, and the fact they would clear their mortgage at a younger age would allow them to help their children do the same later. \"Thus creating a cycle where the children of today's property haves, become the property haves of tomorrow,\" the bank said.</p>","headline":"House prices return to growth in January, says Halifax","trailText":"The bank's monthly index shows a 1.1% rise, but the annual rate of inflation fell to 7.3% from 7.7%","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mg3n","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391678913659/A-row-of-houses-with-one--003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391678913659/A-row-of-houses-with-one--003.jpg","wordcount":"604","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429042941","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8652085","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hilary Osborne","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2039117","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-09T09:29:20Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/06/house-prices-growth-january-halifax","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/feb/06/house-prices-growth-january-halifax","tags":[{"id":"money/houseprices","webTitle":"House prices","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/houseprices","references":[]},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/property","references":[]},{"id":"money/firsttimebuyers","webTitle":"First-time buyers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/firsttimebuyers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"business/housingmarket","webTitle":"Housing market","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/housingmarket","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hilaryosborne","webTitle":"Hilary Osborne","r2ContributorId":"19188","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389368165211/Hilary-Osborne-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hilary Osborne is the editor of guardian.co.uk's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">money</a> site.

One of the women is forced to work 89 hours over seven days at Olira Fashions in Mirpur, a district of Dhaka. Male managers abuse younger girls who they think are not working fast enough and exhausted staff are told they must work all night to get out a big order. They are threatened with beatings or the sack if they don't comply.</p><p>Despite rules that under-18s can only work five hours, many are forced to complete 11-hour days, the documentary claims. One 14-year-old girl tells the undercover camera carrier: \"We have to work to eat.\"</p><p>Workers at Olira, who are seen producing Lee Cooper jeans – which the factory boss says are destined for the UK – earn basic pay of £30 a month, the programme claims.</p><p>At Vase, where BHS school shirts are seen, managers were filmed coaching staff on how to answer any questions put by inspectors who are arriving later that day from a major customer. Staff are told to lie about their working conditions. Managers insist safety equipment that slows production has to be used during the audit, but can be put away once the audit is over. Staff are seen signing documents to say they received nonexistent health and safety training that will be presented to auditors.</p><p>The revelations are embarrassing for another retailer, N Brown, whose Southbay shirts sold via its Jacamo website were filmed being produced at Vase. N Brown, which also owns lingerie website Figleaves.com, played a leading role in an international factory safety agreement put together in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse.</p><p>An N Brown staff member is seconded to a leading role in the Bangladesh Accord on Fire &amp; Building Safety, which has pledged to check and rectify safety measures in over 1,000 factories in Bangladesh.</p><p>Amid huge pressure to improve workers' conditions in the country's £13bn garment industry, nearly 150 retailers and brands, including Arcadia, have signed up to the accord, which aims to survey up to 1,500 factories by October this year as well as train workers.</p><p>There is also a separate, weaker, safety deal mostly signed by US retailers including Asda's owner Walmart, while the UK government is backing a Bangladesh government initiative which promises to improve conditions in factories not covered by the other two projects.</p><p>N Brown said it had a contract with Vase's sister company Basic Shirts but had terminated that deal after being contacted by the Exposure team.</p><p>It said in a statement: \"The conditions found at Vase Apparels are wholly unacceptable, illegal and morally reprehensible. We were not aware that any of our products were being made at Vase Apparels. The work had been contracted to Basic Shirts, which operates out of a different factory entirely, and which we had previously audited as part of our sourcing procedures.\"</p><p>Arcadia said that it had been informed that some of its goods had been stored at Vase but made elsewhere at an accredited supplier which owns other factories in Bangladesh.</p><p>The company said: \"We have carried out a full investigation with our supplier The Fielding Group Ltd, who has categorically confirmed to us that no BHS goods have been made at Vase Apparels.</p><p>\"Our group operates in over 40 countries and arranges inspections of hundreds of factories each year. We take our responsibilities seriously in all the countries our suppliers source from.\" ITV said Lee Cooper declined to be interviewed for the programme, and rejected an offer to view the footage. Lee Cooper's parent firm Iconix did not respond to the Guardian's request for a comment.</p><p>In a brief statement to ITV, it said: \"We employ a strict set of rules to ensure our licensees source responsibly and can confirm that this production is either counterfeit or unauthorised.</p><p>\"We will take all steps to eliminate the unlawful production of Lee Cooper branded products.\"</p><p>The owner of the Vase factory said that garments were sometimes brought to Vase from other factories for presentations and buyers meetings. It told ITV it carried out \"ethical compliance audits\" to ensure worker safety. The Olira owners told the programme: \"We don't use child labour\" but said another factory in the same building had been using children.</p>","headline":"Bangladesh garment factories still exploiting

In a period of austerity, sharply rising house prices and rents will add to household costs and prevent living standards from recovering.</p><p>The chancellor extended austerity to 2018-19 in his autumn statement after lower-than-expected growth reduced tax receipts and swelled the welfare budget. The IFS said the extension means that by the end of this financial year, 60% of planned spending cuts will be yet to come. The ambitious scale of cuts would put the UK on course to have a budget surplus by 2018-19, its first since 2000-01, but national debt would still be 76% of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>The IFS said that even with the scale of cuts planned, national debt would only return to pre-crisis levels in the mid-2030s.</p><p>Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said it would be possible to achieve a budget surplus in the annual accounts in 2018, but only by imposing an extra 30% of cuts on \"unprotected\" areas of spending, excluding schools and health.</p><p>\"Returning growth, and forecasts suggesting we should be running a budget surplus by 2018-19, should not lull us into a false sense that all is now well with the public finances,\" he said.</p><p>\"The outstanding debt will still be very large and the scale of additional spending cuts required to hit that budget surplus remains hugely challenging, especially on top of cuts already delivered. A combination of significant additional spending pledges already made and a growing and ageing population will only add to the challenge.\"</p><p>The IFS said that as a result of population growth, public service spending per head would fall by 2.4% a year between 2010 and 2018.</p><p>It added that even if the overall NHS budget continues to be frozen in real terms, real age-adjusted health spending per person would be 9% lower in 2018–19 than in 2010–11 because of the rising number of over-65s.</p><p>More than two million extra 65-year-olds will qualify for the state pension in 2018 compared with 2010. A dramatic rise in the number of pensioners is due to place a greater strain on public services alongside a broader jump in the population, which is expected to rise by 3.5 million over the same period.</p><p>Osborne has given himself additional problems, following his commitment to spend more than £6bn a year after 2015–16 – implying additional cuts elsewhere.</p><p>Even with £12bn a year of additional spending cuts to social security spending, Osborne's plans would imply cuts in \"unprotected\" public service budgets of more than 30% since 2010, the independent thinktank said. The chancellor has ringfenced health, education and international aid spending from cuts.</p><p>Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, criticised some of the policy moves being considered by the main political parties ahead of the general election next year, including additional spending on childcare and income tax cuts.</p><p>\"Despite the state of the public finances, tax cuts and spending increases are being considered by government and opposition. They seem agreed in promising additional spending on childcare despite a remarkable lack of evidence as to its effectiveness.</p><p>\"They seem equally set on further cuts in income tax either through more increases in the personal allowance or the introduction of a 10p starting rate. Either could be expensive and would be poorly targeted on the low paid.\"</p><p>The IFS report outlined the scale of the challenge still ahead for the UK economy, despite a return to growth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/28/uk-economy-2013-fastest-growth-fourth-quarter-gdp\" title=\"\">GDP increased by 1.9% in 2013</a>, and Oxford Economics, which collaborated with the IFS on the report, is forecasting growth of 2.6% in 2014.</p><p>Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said: \"The unbalanced nature of the recovery to date emphasises the need to avoid complacency.</p><p>\"Nevertheless, we believe that an improving global outlook will provide the basis for the recovery to broaden out this year, by supporting export growth and giving firms the confidence to invest their large cash piles.\"</p><p>He said low inflation and rising wages in the second half of 2014 would improve living standards, while homeowners would continue to enjoy low interest rates until 2015.</p>","headline":"IFS: more than half of George Osborne's planned cuts still to bite","trailText":"Thinktank's 'green budget' finds national debt will only return to

The currency probe comes as regulators are still investigating the manipulation of the Libor lending rate by traders at some of the world’s biggest banks.</p><p>Reuters revealed on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank had fired three New York-based currency traders amid signs of a widening investigation. \"Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory authorities that are investigating trading in the foreign exchange market,\" a bank spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \"The bank is co-operating with those investigations, and will take disciplinary action with regards to individuals if merited.\"</p><p>On Wednesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs’ Steven Cho, formerly global head of spot and forward foreign exchange trading for major currencies, was retiring from the bank. His departure came a day after Citigroup announced that Anil Prasad, its global head of foreign exchange, was leaving the company. It is not know if his retirement is in any way linked to any investigation.</p><p>Citigroup, JP Morgan and others have confirmed they are co-operating with investigations. </p><p>A Citi source told Reuters that the departure of Prasad, who was based in London, was unrelated to any ongoing currency market investigation. </p><p>Prasad’s exit comes a month after Rohan Ramchandani, formerly Citi’s head of European spot foreign exchange trading, was fired. Ramchandani had been a member of the Bank of England’s foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for discussing market issues. The reasons for his dismissal were unknown.</p><p>Lawsky is one of the world’s most powerful regulators and has authority over financial institutions chartered in New York state, including many non-US banks that do business in the country.</p><p>Appointed in 2011, Lawsky rose to prominence after accusing Standard Chartered of orchestrating an illegal money-laundering operation, and threatening to revoke its New York banking licence. News of the investigation triggered a 23% drop in Standard Chartered’s share price and ended with the bank paying a $340m fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services.</p><p>Lawsky’s probe into the FX markets is not the only one under way. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US Department of Justice are also conducting investigations. Swiss regulators are also looking at the markets, and are thought to be focusing on the “fix” – a figure used to price a number of financial products such as funds for private investors.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/financial-conduct-authority-libor-abuse-market-rates-london\">FCA chief Martin Wheatley said this week </a>that he was examining possible abuse of London-based market rates. Wheatley and others continue to examine the Libor interest rate scandal that has led to billions of dollars in fines for banks including Barclays and UBS. \"The allegations are every bit as bad as they have been with Libor. Given what has come out, no, people won't trust the way rates are fixed,\" Wheatley told a Treasury select committee this week.</p><p>Lloyds Banking Group is believed to have been contacted. RBS declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank. Standard Chartered could not immediately be reached. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.</p>","headline":"New York regulator demands bank documents as investigation widens","trailText":"Goldman Sachs and Barclays among banks investigated after reports some traders shared information about currency positions ","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mfzx","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391627363789/71c78575-0f79-4388-8476-9db30ea10670-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391627363789/71c78575-0f79-4388-8476-9db30ea10670-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"625","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"429004651","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f289f2e4b0ab978b0f96d0","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Dominic Rushe in New York and Jill Treanor in London","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2038933","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T14:15:20-05:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/05/new-york-regulator-banks-trading-investigation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/05/new-york-regulator-banks-trading-investigation","tags":[{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking","references":[]},{"id":"business/banking-reform","webTitle":"Banking reform","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking-reform","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking-reform","references":[]},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/currencies","references":[]},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.
