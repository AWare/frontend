For some, this was the most important aspect of his speech, given how little to date his presidency has offered the so-called \"climate concerned\". He gave the strong impression that climate change was back, square and centre, on the Oval Office desk, something he had promised on the election trail, both in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>But details matter when it comes to climate and energy policies. And details were lacking in his speech. We still don't know, for example, what he intends to do with the Keystone pipeline. What does he mean by \"significantly\" when he says he will authorise it, but only if it \"does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem\"? And without instruments such as carbon taxes and \"cap and trade\", how can we be sure that his beloved shale gas only ever replaces coal and not, as some fear, also curtails growth in renewables?</p> <p>And what of the wider question of whether the US's current emissions targets are enough to help prevent global temperatures rising above 2C over the course of this century? Judging by the calculations of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/26/barack-obama-climate-action-plan#block-51cac596e4b023faee6c7c11\">Prof Piers Forster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/26/barack-obama-climate-action-plan#block-51cafaa9e4b0e2a9937599df\">Dr Chris Hope</a>, it would appear the current targets are woefully short of where they need to be. But, if we're being honest, we already knew that.</p> <p>Therefore, Obama's speech can certainly be spun&nbsp;positively as \"better late than never\", but a pragmatic assessment must conclude that the US is still making baby steps when huge strides forward are required. This is not the global leadership so many wish the US to take on climate change.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cafaa9e4b0e2a9937599df\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T15:28:57.910+01:00\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reacting to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/26/barack-obama-climate-action-plan#block-51cac596e4b023faee6c7c11\">earlier analysis</a> by Prof Piers Forster, <a href=\"http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/faculty/hopec.html\">Dr Chris Hope</a>, a climate change policy researcher and PAGE model developer at the <a href=\"http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/\">University of Cambridge Judge Business School</a>, has sent me his <a href=\"http://www.chrishopepolicy.com/2013/06/how-much-will-the-world-benefit-from-obamas-climate-plan/\">own calculations</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Piers Forster made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/26/barack-obama-climate-action-plan#block-51cac596e4b023faee6c7c11\">some initial calculations</a> that a 17% drop in US emissions by 2020 could reduce CO2 concentrations in 2100 by between 3 and 5 ppm, and reduce temperature rises by between 0.02C and 0.04C compared to where they would be without the US plan. But Piers&rsquo;s calculation used just a single value for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3C.</p> <p>The PAGE09 model (<a href=\"http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/working_papers/2011/wp1104.pdf\">pdf</a>) uses a range of climate sensitivities consistent with the latest IPCC reports. Running Obama&rsquo;s plan to reduce US emissions by 17% by 2020 through 10,000 runs of the PAGE09 model confirms that, with a range of ECS values, the plan will reduce global mean temperatures by between 0.012C and 0.032C by 2100 (5-95% values), with a most likely reduction of 0.02C, compared to business as usual. The PAGE09 model can also do what Piers could not, and make an estimate of how much this drop in temperatures would reduce global damages from climate change. The answer is it will reduce them by between 0.5 and 10.5 trillion dollars (5-95% values), with a mean reduction in damage of 4.5 trillion dollars.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/25/obama-climate-speech-expert-verdict\">other commentators have said</a>, it&rsquo;s a start.</p> <p>(Details: US CO2 emissions assumed to be 17% below base year (2008) emissions from 2020 until 2075.

The rise was owing to the cold winter and more power coming from coal, which is currently cheap.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/committee-on-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\">committee on climate change</a>, in its annual progress report, said this was a temporary increase and the UK was likely to meet its carbon reduction goals for 2017. But it warned that without strong measures the UK would miss its carbon reduction targets from 2017 to 2027. When the effects of last year's rise are stripped out, the underlying emissions trend is for a 1% to 1.5% decrease in emissions each year &ndash; less than half the 3% annual reductions needed to meet longer-term climate goals.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cacb41e4b049e62ebabe95\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T12:07:15.875+01:00\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Twitter reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/James_BG/statuses/349814585571803136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Important point in Obama speech that has not picked up much coverage - he calls on people to divest from fossil fuels <a href=\"http://t.co/bvS4TQ58n2\">http://t.co/bvS4TQ58n2</a></p>&mdash; James Murray (@James_BG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_BG/statuses/349814585571803136\">June 26, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic/statuses/349814496417693697\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Why Obama&#39;s Climate Change Plan Is Hopeless Without China <a href=\"http://t.co/CgYFut6ig4\">http://t.co/CgYFut6ig4</a></p>&mdash; The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic/statuses/349814496417693697\">June 26, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/insideclimate/statuses/349782307726561280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Obama tries to breathe life into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23climate&amp;src=hash\">#climate</a> agenda that has slipped from his control.

He kindly emailed me this response:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fall in global CO2 emissions from 2008-2009 with the economic downturn and a 10% reduction in US emissions since 2005 (1), global emissions are roughly following the worst-case emission scenarios that will be used in the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Report (2).</p> <p>Commentators are at odds about exactly what cuts the new policy will achieve, but if we optimistically assume that US emissions will follow the Copenhagen agreement and reduce by 17% from 2005-2020 (3), this could save up to 1000 million metric tonnes of global CO2 emissions (around 3% of current world values). If we further assume that this is a real global cut from the worse-case scenario and emissions growth elsewhere doesn&rsquo;t compensate (as previously happened with huge growth in China over 2005-2011), we can go on to calculate the effect on atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature.</p> <p>To do this we estimated CO2 changes with the Bern pulse carbon cycle model (4) and temperature changes by using a simple model of climate (5) that is tuned to the latest climate model projections from our recent paper (6). These cuts acting alone would have a small but significant effect, reducing projected CO2 levels by 3 ppm in 2050 and 5 ppm in 2100, giving us between 0.02 and 0.04 C less warming in 2050 and staving off passing the 2C warming mark by 2-5 years. This may seem small as current levels of 400 ppm could easily pass 500 ppm by 2050, but every little helps.</p> <ol> <li>US emissions were 5940 million metric tonnes in 2005 and 5420 million metric tonnes in 2011.

A key point in the president&rsquo;s plan is a vague directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to establish carbon pollution standards for new and existing power plants &mdash; standards already required by law. The plan fails to address the Keystone XML pipeline, fracking on public lands and other dirty extreme-energy projects that could fatally undermine the climate change fight...The pollution control measures announced by the president today are aimed at fulfilling his administration&rsquo;s pledge to put the United States on the path to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. But such a reduction falls far short of what the U.S. pledged in the Kyoto Protocol and would not be enough to avert catastrophic temperature rises, according to climate scientists.</p> <p><strong>Bjorn Lomborg in </strong><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/25/obama-climate-change-georgetown-column/2455723/\">USA Today</a>: Fracking is this decade's green solution. Obama recognizes gas as a \"bridge fuel.\" Replacing dirtier coal, cheaper gas from fracking has cut up to 500 MT of the U.S. CO2 emissions. This is 10 times more than what renewables do, and while renewables cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars, fracking has saved the U.S. consumer $125 billion annually in cheaper energy prices. Fracking has local environmental issues, but these can all be addressed with good regulation. Moving the US fracking miracle to the rest of the world will be the biggest source of CO2 reductions this decade, and simultaneously increase global welfare by allowing energy access to billions yet unserved.</p> <p><strong>Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK</strong>: The president's plan wouldn&rsquo;t reduce carbon pollution as much as scientists say is needed, but he rightly zeros in on executive branch actions, rather than waiting any longer for Congress. President Obama correctly sees this as an all-hands-on-deck moment requiring a government-wide plan, including action on pollution from the largest source of US emissions -- existing dirty power plants. Recognizing that the US needs to meet its international commitments and strongly support robust international action is also crucial as the world works to forge a new global climate pact by 2015.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/obama-challenge-climate-energy-projects/blog/45723/\">Phil Radford</a>, executive director of Greenpeace USA</strong>: We proudly stand with Obama in the fight against carbon pollution, but we know that this fight won't be won with words alone...It's clear there's no room in our future for the Keystone pipeline, fracking, Arctic drilling, or giving away our public lands to the coal industry. Each of these projects will have a significant negative climate impact and not be in our national interest.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2013/06/sierra-club-statement-president-obama%E2%80%99s-climate-plan\">Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club</a></strong>: The Sierra Club&rsquo;s 2.1 million members and supporters issued a collective cheer as they heard the President declare that the most effective defense against climate disruption will be by tackling the biggest single source of carbon pollution: coal plants...While we must reduce pollution further to truly address dangerous climate disruption, we applaud the Administration&rsquo;s continued commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020. This plan includes key steps to reaching that goal, and we look forward to working with the Obama Administration to build on the progress laid out in today&rsquo;s announcement.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's a Google+ Hangout hosted by <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2013/06/live-blog-obama-rolls-out-climate-plan-2/\">ClimateDesk</a>'s James West, featuring Grist's <a href=\"http://grist.org/author/david-roberts/\">David Roberts</a> and Mother Jones's <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/authors/kate-sheppard\">Kate Sheppar</a>d...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0nkzDJYyZg\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/s0nkzDJYyZg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab9aae4b023faee6c7c00\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T10:51:38.805+01:00\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comment-on-obamas-climate-change-speech/\">Science Media Centre</a> has gathered together some reaction from academia...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Myles Allen, head of the climate dynamics group, University of Oxford</strong><strong>: </strong>Focussing on the basics &mdash; long-term solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions &mdash; is exactly what is needed. In a nutshell, we started out with four trillion tonnes of fossil carbon underground. It has taken us 250 years to dump half a trillion tonnes into the atmosphere; if we carry on as we are, we'll dump the next half-trillion in about 35 years; and the half-trillion after that will take us over two degrees. It really is that simple &mdash; but European and global climate policy is a well-intentioned mess, much of it irrelevant to real challenge of limiting total carbon emissions. Let's hope America can get us back on course to a simple, effective long-term solution.</p> <p><strong>Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London:</strong> There has been important action on climate change in many US states, but I am very pleased to see this plan for federal action. Reduction in US greenhouse gas emissions is crucial. Equally important is the proposed US leadership role in international negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Dr David Reay, senior lecturer in carbon management, University of Edinburgh: </strong>As President Obama packs his bags for a week-long trip to Africa, the international ramifications of his new climate change plan must be on his mind. Any ambition for big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the US is somewhat hobbled by the Republican control of Congress but, with a ramped-up commitment to financing of the UN's Green Climate Fund, Obama can still walk the talk on tackling global climate change.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab652e4b05e0c044bbaf6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T10:37:42.776+01:00\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US newspaper reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's how the speech went down in some US newspapers...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-climate-20130625,0,1016446.story\">Baltimore Sun</a>: It falls far short of the truly significant reforms that are needed, but it at least moves America in the right direction, away from burning fossil fuels and toward renewable energy and greater fuel efficiency...A far better approach would involve some form of carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy that gave greater flexibility to energy providers. It would let the marketplace determine the solution. And fossil fuel-based forms of energy would be forced to pay for the harm they cause. In return, the federal government might reduce other taxes so that average consumers would suffer little-to-no net loss while the invisible hand of the free market works its magic. But that kind of proposal would require action by Congress and, unfortunately, it's far easier for opponents to attack climate change policy as a \"jobs killer,\" a term filled with irony given that global warming is the real killer.</p> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/opinion/at-last-an-action-plan-on-climate.html?ref=opinion\">New York Times</a>: It is an impressive lineup that aims not only to reduce carbon emissions but to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/climate-action-plan\">strengthen the nation&rsquo;s defenses</a> against rising seas, more intense storms, drought and other consequences of global warming. But, so far, it is only a list, involving many moving parts and government agencies, and seeing it through will require coordination and, above all, a continuing commitment from him.</p> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/plan-b-for-climate-change/2013/06/25/9a9bb060-ddc9-11e2-b197-f248b21f94c4_story.html\">Washington Post</a>: <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/highlights-of-obamas-plan-to-cut-carbon/263/\" data-xslt=\"_http\">Mr. Obama&rsquo;s plan</a> is far from perfect. For one thing, it excludes the best anti-emissions policies, such as carbon taxes, that all require Congress&rsquo;s approval. For another, it appears the EPA&rsquo;s new rules on existing power plants could take a very long time to write and implement. The president has also larded up his plan with some of the usual nonsense that poses as energy policy in Washington, such as $8 billion in loan guarantees for fossil fuel technologies like <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ccs/index.html\" data-xslt=\"_http\">carbon capture and sequestration</a>, which hasn&rsquo;t proven to be anything but excessively expensive. And the country still requires a long-term strategy to green the economy. But the major elements of the White House&rsquo;s plan are still far better than settling for congressional inaction. Republicans in Congress, who were swift to criticize Mr. Obama on Tuesday, should offer him a better way to reduce emissions meaningfully while minimizing the economic effects. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s time for the president to follow through.</p> <p><strong>The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323683504578567533647032380.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_carousel_1\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong>: Mr. Obama's ambitions will have no effect on global atmospheric carbon concentrations. Emissions are already falling in the U.S., thanks primarily to the shale gas boom, but emissions are rising in the developing world. Mr. Obama pandered to the climate-change absolutists by saying \"We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society.\" But he never explained how his plan will reduce warming, or why climate models have failed to predict the warming slowdown of the last dozen or so years even as more CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab1a9e4b05e0c044bbaf1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T10:17:29.290+01:00\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I will be adding to these voices throughout the day, but the Guardian has already rounded up a snapshot of reaction to the speech <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/25/obama-climate-speech-expert-verdict\">here</a>.

He also said he would continue to press the issue as a priority of his second term even in the face of implacable opposition from Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>\"I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing,\" Obama said to a gathering of students.</p> <p>Obama outlined a broad range of measures to cut greenhouse <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gas\">gas</a> emissions and promote the development of renewable&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy\">energy</a>, protect coastlines and cities from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/flooding\">flooding</a>&nbsp;and sea-level rise, and encourage efforts to reach a global climate deal.</p> <p>The over-arching goal was to put the US on track to meet its commitment to cut <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-emissions\">carbon emissions</a> 17% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>But can his plans achieve that goal? Is it enough? He signalled in the speech, for example, that he would only allow the expansion of the controversial <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/keystone-xl-pipeline\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> carrying tarsands oil from Canada to ports in the Gulf of Mexico if it \"does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem\".

That they were only narrowly defeated is a victory of sorts, given the odds against them. In fact, they ended up forcing one of the narrowest victories for the government in a whipped vote during this parliament.</p> <p>But the cold reality is that the energy bill moves forward to the upper house without a firm commitment to ensuring the UK's electricity is generated with next-to-no carbon emissions by 2030. That will clearly make it even harder for the nation to meet its legal-binding 80% reduction target by 2050. The nation is fast running out of wiggle room.</p> <p>This government clearly likes to gamble. It is gambling that its beloved \"dash for gas\" will have its emissions abated in the mid-term with as-yet-unproven carbon capture and storage technology. It is gambling that, as a result of fracking, gas prices will be lower than they are today in the decades ahead. Similarly, it is gambling that the \"whole life costs\" of nuclear power will be kept to a minimum in the decades ahead. It is gambling that gas will only replace coal and not, in addition, stifle investment in low-carbon energy sources, thereby potentially undoing the gains any coal-to-gas transition achieves in terms of net emissions reductions.</p> <p>With the stakes so high, the government appears to favour high-risk bets on the future as opposed to guaranteeing a more risk-free landscape for those seeking to invest in next-generation, low-carbon power supplies. As a result, the odds of meeting our 2050 climate targets, let alone any early commitments, appear to have lengthened today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ae155de4b089091b023bd4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T17:27:09.719+01:00\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fiona Harvey's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/04/decarbonisation-target-defeated-energy-bill-vote\">news story</a> is now live on the Guardian website:</p> <blockquote> <p>Several potential rebels, including the Lib Dem president Tim Farron, were persuaded by a promise by the coalition to allow the secretary of state to consider a 2030 decarbonisation target in 2016.</p> <p>But before then, the government will review the fourth carbon budget, which sets out how much carbon dioxide the UK can produce each year to 2027. David Cameron, under pressure from greens, agreed early in the coalition to set a stiff carbon budget that would require roughly halving the UK's carbon output by the late 2020s. However, he bowed to George Osborne, the chancellor, who opposes green regulation, in allowing a review of that target next year, in 2014.</p> <p>The fight over the fourth carbon budget looks set to be intense, as the close nature of Tuesday's vote shows. Many Tories back Osborne's call for a new \"dash for gas\", which they say will be cheaper than renewable power, and are concerned that the UK is taking on more than its share of emissions cuts. The Committee on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change\">Climate Change</a> recently produced a report rebutting those arguments, and showing that the UK could benefit from cheaper energy if more renewable generation is built sooner rather than later.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ae14a7e4b0945f272d228b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T17:24:08.089+01:00\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More reaction to the vote...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Tim Dixon, chair in sustainable futures in the built environment at the University of Reading&rsquo;s School of Construction Management and Engineering</strong>:The omission of a clear decarbonisation target for energy supply from the energy bill will create even greater uncertainty over the UK meeting its longer term 2050 carbon emissions targets and space for a sustainable and diverse array of energy sources to plug the gaps. Energy policy needs to be reconnected with energy efficiency measures in an integrated way, and within a coherent low carbon strategy to create greater certainty for investors. Much of the expected energy efficiency take-up measures are tied into a successful implementation of the green deal, and this will require further incentivisation and reconfiguration if it is to succeed. A binding decarbonisation target for 2030 should be introduced in line with the Committee on Climate Change recommendations, and this should be part of a strategic approach to a Low Carbon UK economy by 2050.</p> <p><strong>Caroline Flint MP, Labour&rsquo;s Shadow Energy and Climate Change</strong>: If we are serious about tackling spiralling energy bills, improving our country&rsquo;s energy security and stopping dangerous climate change, Britain must decarbonise its power sector. The government&rsquo;s failure to back a decarbonisation target will leave households vulnerable to completely unnecessary increases to their energy bills and cause Britain to miss out on vital new clean energy jobs. The transition to a low-carbon economy has the potential to be a major source of growth and prosperity, but the government&rsquo;s failure to back a decarbonisation target means businesses will choose to invest and create jobs elsewhere. This is a humiliating failure by the Liberal Democrats and a betrayal of David Cameron&rsquo;s promise to be the greenest government ever.</p> <p><strong>Dr Alison Doig, Christian Aid&rsquo;s senior climate Change adviser</strong>: By voting to omit a decarbonisation target for our electricity sector MPs have increased confusion for the industry, destabilised investment across our energy sector and put into question the government&rsquo;s commitment to the UK&rsquo;s climate change target. There are no winners, just continued uncertainty. Christian Aid is part of a wide coalition of 55 organisations, including major trade associations, industry, investors, church groups and NGOs calling for MPs to act to put the UK on track to become a world leading low-carbon economy. We believe this is too important to give up on. There is time for this decision to be put right and for clear signals to industry to be put in place. The impacts of climate change and our unsustainable thirst for fossil fuels is already threatening some of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable people through increasing drought, floods and climate disasters.</p> <p><strong>John Alker, director of policy and communications at the UK Green Building Council</strong>: There was a remarkable degree of consensus, from both private sector and NGOs, about the importance of a decarbonisation target in the bill. Some coalition MPs chose to listen to the evidence and stand up and be counted this afternoon &ndash; sadly, not quite enough. The real danger is that this sends another signal to business that government isn&rsquo;t serious enough about the future direction of travel on carbon, when progressive businesses are crying out for political leadership and policy certainty. On a more positive note, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see energy demand reduction getting the attention it deserves. There is still an enormous, and largely untapped potential to reduce energy use cost-effectively across the entire UK building stock, not only reducing pressure on new generating capacity, but getting the construction industry moving again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ae0c10e4b00a6ab14f1e93\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T16:47:29.584+01:00\">4.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Twitter reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/doug_parr/statuses/341940968578248704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greenpeace comment on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vote4cleanpower&amp;src=hash\">#vote4cleanpower</a> rebellion.

With significant numbers of MPs defying the party whip to join the Opposition by voting for clean power, this issue will not go away. The fight now moves to the Lords, where peers from all parties, cross benchers and bishops are expected to back power sector decarbonisation, because they know it&rsquo;s essential for safeguarding our economy and environment.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Ziga of Fuel Poverty Action</strong>: In failing to set a target on clean energy, the government has yet again let down hard-up UK households. The government's own&nbsp;advisers&nbsp;have shown that a clean power target could have saved households up to &pound;1,600 on our bills. Instead, the door has been opened for a new generation of gas power stations, which will mean sky-rocketing fuel bills and more extreme weather due to climate change. The time has come for civil disobedience and direct action - the fight for a clean, cheap energy future isn't over</p> <p><strong>James Murray, <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2272641/breaking-decarbonisation-target-goes-down-to-narrow-defeat\">BusinessGreen</a></strong>:&nbsp;The move will be seen as a major blow to green businesses, many of which have argued that a decarbonisation target would help to mobilise billions of pounds of investment in the clean energy supply chain...</p> <p>The relatively close nature of the vote means attention will now turn to the Lords where green campaigners are confident the amendment could still pass. Lib Dem and Conservative peers have shown themselves to be more rebellious than their Commons colleagues in recent years, while a number of bishops and cross bench peers are expected to support the adoption of a decarbonisation target.</p> <p>\"The House of Lords has been very rebellious of late,\" observed one green campaigner. \"There was always a greater chance of the amendment passing in the Lords than the Commons.\"</p> <p>If the amendment is adopted by the House of Lords it is likely to result in the bill being shuttled back and forth between the two houses, requiring the government to make some form of concession in the bill or, in extreme circumstances, force the legislation through using the Parliament Act.</p> <p>However, if it is defeated for again in the Lords the focus will shift towards whether the government can deliver on its promise that the other main elements of the energy bill - the contract for difference support scheme, capacity mechanism, and emissions performance standard - will mobilise an estimated &pound;110bn of clean energy investment by 2020.</p> <p><strong>Gaynor Hartnell, Renewable Energy Association's chief executive</strong>: Today&rsquo;s vote is disappointing. It makes an EU-level renewables target for 2030 even more important, something the &lsquo;greenest government ever&rsquo; is also opposing in Europe. Failing to decarbonise our electricity supply industry will have long term consequences both environmentally and economically.&nbsp;The government&rsquo;s own advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, state that relying on gas will only save the country money in a scenario of low gas prices, whereas switching to renewables would save the country &pound;25bn-45bn by the 2020s.</p> <p><strong>Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK</strong>: It&rsquo;s really disappointing that the decarbonisation target was rejected so narrowly. However with the government scraping by with only 23 votes, MPs from all parties have sent a powerful signal that they are not convinced that the coalition&rsquo;s crude compromise is best for Britain. This issue is sure to return in the House of Lords where parliament will have another opportunity to put it right.</p> <p>The coalition&rsquo;s mixed messages have undermined confidence in the low carbon energy market and sent damaging signals about the UK&rsquo;s commitment to our legally binding climate goals. Debate has centred on the decarbonisation target &ndash; which would give a much-needed boost to investor confidence &ndash; but the mixed messages about the gas strategy, the fourth carbon budget, and the hype around shale gas are also cause for concern.</p> <p>Making a decisive call now to move towards a low-carbon power sector would prevent delaying investments in the low-carbon projects we urgently need to keep the lights on and reduce our emissions. It would also help trigger long-term investments in developing a UK supply chain that will help reduce the costs of the new low-carbon technologies like offshore wind and CCS and boost economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T16:49:17.370+01:00\">at 4.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51ae06dde4b04bdb0ac16d58\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T16:25:18.391+01:00\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tim Yeo's amendment has been defeated - more narrowly than was predicted.

There was 267 Ayes supporting the amendment and 290 Noes.</p> <p>Yeo has just put out this statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Commons has missed an opportunity today to provide more clarity for investors on the future direction of energy policy. Unfortunately this could mean that urgently needed investment in our energy infrastructure will be slower and the risk of a capacity crisis greater.&rdquo;</p> <p>The continuing uncertainty that will result increases the perceived risk of investment and will therefore raise capital costs, meaning that consumers may ultimately pay more for the new power plants that need to be built.&rdquo;</p> <p>Perhaps more worryingly, failure to introduce a clean energy target now could make it harder for the UK to meet its long-term carbon reduction targets, forcing future governments to take more costly action to curb emissions later when the impacts of a changing climate become more acute.</p> <p>Fortunately, the House of Lords still has a chance to amend the energy bill to ensure the government takes the advice of its statutory independent climate advisors for decarbonising the electricity generation industry. I urge my colleagues in the other House to continue the fight.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ae03c8e4b00a6ab14f1e8b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T16:12:09.495+01:00\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/04/energy-bill-amendment-climate-goals?commentpage=1#block-51adc775e4b04bdb0ac16d0f\">question earlier</a> about whether the UK was on course to meet its carbon target for 2020, I have received this email from <a href=\"http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.co.uk/\">Roger Pielke Jr</a>, professor of environmental studies at the <a href=\"http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/\">Center for Science and Technology Policy Research</a> at the University of Colorado at Boulder:</p> <blockquote> <p>I have looked at updated decarbonization data for the UK using data from:</p> <p>1) on GDP from ONS (in 2009 values):<br /><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-284969\">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-284969</a></p> <p>2) On CO2 emissions from DECC:<br /><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provisional-uk-emissions-estimates\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provisional-uk-emissions-estimates</a></p> <p>Here is what I have found, building upon the peer-reviewed paper I did in 2009 here:<br /><a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/2/024010/fulltext/\">http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/2/024010/fulltext/</a></p> <p>[Note that because I am using different data sources, the numbers I present below a a bit of apples and oranges as compared to the numbers in the paper - so caution is urged in any direct comparison.]</p> <p>Since the Climate Change Act was passed in 2008 (so from 2009 to 2012), the UK economy decarbonized (that is, the rate of reduction in CO2/GDP, a necessary condition for emissions reductions when GDP is constant or growing) at a rate of 1.1% per year. CO2 emissions changed little, going from 480.7 MMT (million metric tonnes) in 2009 to 479.1 MMT in 2012. Over that same period GDP increased by 3.1% (but remains below 2007 values). From 2011 to 2012 CO2 emissions actually increased by 4.5%,</p> <p>In order to achieve the goal of a 34% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2022 as specified in the CC Act will require a rate of decarbonization of 3.0% per year (assuming a 1% annual rate of GDP growth) to a rate of 4.9% per year (assuming a 3% rate of GDP growth). Such rates have not been achieved historically over such a long period and imply a substantial acceleration of recent decarbonization (i.e., since the passage of the CC Act) by ~3-5 times as compared to recent years. Decarbonization of the UK economy has actually slowed significantly since the passage of the CCA (it was ~3% per year in the 3 years prior to the passage of the Act).</p> <p>In short, it seems that the provisions of the UK Climate Change Act can only be met by non-CO2 accounting measures, such as the use of offsets or accounting of non-CO2 GHGs/land use or perhaps other mechanisms of accounting (I note that DECC's official projections are based on erroneous assumptions about the price of oil, the price of EU ETS allowances and exchange rates, suggesting that even accounting mechanisms may not be enough to hide the failure of the UK economy to decarbonize at a rate necessary to hit a 34% reduction target). Such measures may (or may not) fulfill the statutory legal requirements. However, it seems clear that at present -- at least with respect to carbon dioxide -- the UK is not on track to meet emissions reduction targets. Assumptions of rapid increases in decarbonization yet to come remain exactly that until actions are taken and evidence shows such acceleration.</p> <p>In short, the analysis and conclusions that I presented in my 2009 paper remain solid. With respect to carbon dioxide, under positive economic growth it will be very difficult and likely impossible for the UK to meet its mandated targets for emissions reductions. Accounting mechanisms can help with perceptions, but will not alter the underlying dynamics.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have asked Pielke to expand on what he means by Decc's \"erroneous assumptions\". I will post any answer I receive here.</p> <p><em>UPDATE</em>: Pielke has just emailed me this:</p> <blockquote> <p>*ETS carbon price assumed currently to be 7.2 Euros and rising, presently about half that<br />*Oil price assumed to be &gt;$115, currently about $100</p> <p>How much will these matter? Not clear, but as assumptions that go into the analysis they are clearly off by a significant amount.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T16:16:43.550+01:00\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51ae000ae4b04bdb0ac16d4f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T15:56:11.054+01:00\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European edition of the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial headlined, \"<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324063304578523304247959058.html\">Britain's No-Energy Bill</a>\", says \"Cameron government puts 'decarbonization' above growth\":</p> <blockquote> <p>The UK's 2013 energy bill is up for a key vote Tuesday, and even the best-case outcome is likely to hurt an already weak British economy.

What we need is a solution that the solar industry and investors can have real confidence in, and quickly.</p> <p>The UK solar industry installed over 0.5GW of solar in first three months of this year. Solar has demonstrated the fastest cost reduction of all technologies so we are confident, with the right energy bill framework, solar will make a massive contribution to delivering clean energy for the UK, and cost-effectively.

The assertion that it could save money compared with an alternative relies on the idea that a team of civil servants can consistently beat the market over a period of almost two decades, which, if true, might lead these people to stop being civil servants and make some money with their incredible powers of foresight.</p> <p>A second argument made in favour of the target, that it will improve confidence among investors in low-carbon technologies, is even less persuasive. These investors are already being given a huge chunk of their longed-for certainty. First, they have the Climate Change Act which gives those legally binding 2050 commitments, which no other country has matched. Secondly, the energy bill itself is going to provide low carbon generators with decades-long guaranteed prices. Thirdly, the treasury has agreed to provide around &pound;9bn of support for low carbon generation in 2020 or, more accurately, it has made the commitment on behalf of electricity billpayers as these tariffs will be collected through bills. How much more certainty do they need? Do the amendment&rsquo;s backers really think that an airy commitment to electricity decarbonisation will entice investors presently unconvinced by the impending cash bonanza?</p> <p>A more useful debate is whether the target is necessary to meet carbon budgets and the 2050 carbon target established in the Climate Change Act, and whether, even if it costs more than not trying to get it done by 2030, it is still worth doing. This argument can be narrowed down considerably. Emissions from the electricity generation sector are covered by the EU&rsquo;s Emissions Trading System. While that remains in force, any savings from the UK electricity system the cap might create would be cancelled out by higher emissions elsewhere in Europe. The only place that genuine savings are plausible is in parts of the economy not presently covered by the ETS (such as transport and heating). If the only plausible way to decarbonise these is through electrification (which is a big if) then a less carbon-intensive electricity system will help with that. However, a more expensive electricity system will hinder that, which is another reason to be cautious about the proclaimed benefits of the target.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51add050e4b00a6ab14f1e50\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T12:32:54.787+01:00\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier this week, the former energy minister Charles Hendry wrote a <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2013/06/charles-hendry-mp.html\">comment piece</a> for Conservative Home entitled, \"Why we shouldn't put a decarbonisation target in the Energy Bill this week\":</p> <blockquote> <p>It is good for ministers to challenge people to raise their aspirations and ambitions, and targets are part of that process, but they can only be relevant if we know how to meet them. As a minister, I always questioned targets where there was not a 'roadmap' for delivering them.</p> <p>The challenge with a decarbonisation target set now for 2030 is that we cannot yet know how it can be met - or indeed, if it can be met.</p> <p>Nuclear may not happen on the scale hoped for - and it is hard to see how we can meet a decarbonisation target without new nuclear. Some of the emerging renewable technologies, such as offshore wind and tidal, may remain too expensive, and we don't yet know if their costs will come down to make them affordable for consumers. Carbon capture and storage, which could give a low-carbon future for coal and gas, has yet to be proven commercially, and we don't yet know if it would cost. Unabated gas is relatively plentiful and is certainly lower in its carbon intensity than coal, but on its own would not enable us to reach the low level of emissions which the 2030 target would be likely to require.</p> <p>My difficulty with the target, therefore, is that we would be requiring it to be set without knowing that it can be met, and that cannot be a responsible decision for government to make, when the costs of getting it wrong would have to be picked up by consumers for decades to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Stephen Gilbert, the MP for St Austell and Newquay, has <a href=\"http://m.libdemvoice.org/stephen-gilbert-writes-liberal-democrats-should-be-proud-of-the-energy-bill-34756.html\">posted his thoughts</a> on Liberal Democrat Voice:</p> <blockquote> <p>What we have got is the power to set the world&rsquo;s first decarbonisation target for the electricity sector 14 years ahead of the target date of 2030.

Thousands of large-scale offshore wind turbines are due to be installed in the UK, but none so far have been wholly made in the UK. Renewable UK argues that the government should send the right signals to major investors deciding where to build major wind turbine factories.</p> <p>Targets on emissions and renewables for 2030 are key to providing a long-term framework for investment. There&rsquo;s evidence that annual growth in renewable energy rose sharply since the EU introduced renewable energy targets, from a growth rate of 1.9% per annum (1995-2000) to 4.5% (2001-2010). The EU ETS has failed to date to deliver long-term carbon price signals. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the mandatory renewable energy targets for 2020 has addressed this market failure by accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across the EU. We need to maintain that momentum by continuing this targeted approach to 2030.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adc9b0e4b04bdb0ac16d12\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T12:04:16.721+01:00\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those who want to watch today's debate and vote, the Commons website has a live feed available <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=13186\">here</a>.

[The 3rd budget covers the period 2018-2022.]</p> </blockquote> <p>However, the table on page 20 suggests that the 4th carbon budget, covering the period 2023-2027, is not likely to be met, according to the latest projections.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adc4bfe4b00a6ab14f1e34\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T11:43:11.493+01:00\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following on from Andrew Pendleton's view <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/04/energy-bill-amendment-climate-goals?commentpage=1#block-51adbb0ae4b04bdb0ac16cf4\">quoted earlier</a>, Guy Shrubshole, an energy campaigner at <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/what_we_do/clean_british_energy_clean_power_action_39060.html\">Friends of the Earth</a>, has emailed me his more detailed thoughts on today's vote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The vote today on a clean power target is a choice between two alternative visions of Britain&rsquo;s energy future. A vote for Tim Yeo&rsquo;s amendment is a vote to stay within our existing Climate Change Act commitments, and meet them in a way that the government&rsquo;s own advisers say is cheapest and most cost-effective. If we don&rsquo;t take the carbon out of our electricity supply, we would have to find other ways to cut more carbon from other sectors, such as transport or heating - and that&rsquo;s likely to be much more expensive. But the chancellor, George Osborne, opposes a clear target to decarbonise the power sector and favours an alternative route - to embark on building over 30 new gas plants in a new dash for gas.</p> <p>If Osborne gets his way, there is no question that the UK will breach its legally binding climate change targets. The difference between the chancellor's vision and low-carbon power is staggering. Late last year the government brought out a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gas-generation-strategy\">gas strategy</a> in which it considered - at the treasury&rsquo;s behest - a plan for a tripling of gas power from today&rsquo;s levels. This would only be possible, the government admitted, if the legally-binding 4th carbon budget (covering the years 2022-2027) were to be weakened to allow for higher carbon emissions.</p> <p>Osborne&rsquo;s high-carbon route would result in an extra&nbsp;500m tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted over the period 2020-2040: equivalent to every UK car and taxi on the road for eight years, or every UK flight for 16 years. This figure is based on Friends of the Earth&rsquo;s analysis of the government&rsquo;s own figures, full details of which can be found <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/event_presentations/2030_decarbonisation_targe.pdf\"> here</a>.</p> <p>Without a clear and binding 2030 clean power target, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that Osborne won&rsquo;t embark on a dash for gas, and breach our climate goals - or, at the very least, make them much more expensive to meet. When the clean alternative also brings with it new investment and jobs for the UK, you can see why so many MPs are rebelling to include a clean power target in the energy bill!</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T11:58:52.817+01:00\">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51adc356e4b04bdb0ac16d04\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T11:37:11.229+01:00\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>BBC News online has an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22764955\">assessment</a> of how the vote is likely to pan out:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Yeo's amendment, calling for a decarbonisation \"target range\" to be set by April 2014, could be backed by more than 10 Lib Dems and a handful of Conservatives.</p> <p>Among those to sign the amendment are former Lib Dem minister Andrew Stunnell and Tory backbenchers Zac Goldsmith, Sir Peter Bottomley and David Amess.</p> <p>If passed, the BBC's environmental analyst Roger Harrabin said it would ensure that almost all electricity is generated from carbon-free sources like wind and nuclear by 2030.</p> <p>However, the government is still expected to win the vote when the matter is debated later in the House of Commons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adc271e4b00a6ab14f1e2d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T11:33:29.689+01:00\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reader reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some interesting comments have already been posted below by readers...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24055585\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/10209655\" title=\"View bioenergyaction’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/06/27/10209655/3e7211f1-a39b-4712-9620-522b3e260b44/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for bioenergyaction\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/10209655\" title=\"View bioenergyaction’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">bioenergyaction</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24055585\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">04 June 2013 10:46am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The aims of a carbon intensity traget are laudable, but the focus on carbon is too crude a measure to create a truly sustainable energy future.</p> <p>At present the UK is looking to meet at least <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-use-of-low-carbon-technologies/supporting-pages/bioenergy\" rel=\"nofollow\">30% of the &quot;renewable energy&quot; targets through bioenergy by 2020</a>.

Yet the UKs largest power station, Drax, is already in the process of converting half of it's entire operation to biomass. Tilbury B has already converted to biomass, Ironbridge is in the process of converting and many dedicated biomass power stations are now in the works. These current plans will consume more than 8x the UKs total wood supply. The embodied energy of wood, versers a fossil fuel like coal, make biomass <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/biomass_report_tcm9-326672.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least as dirty as coal</a>, so we are faced with replacing one dirty energy source with another under the guise of sustainable low-carbon energy.</p> <p>In addition, this focus on carbon sidelines the crucial issues such as biodiversity, food security and land rights.

So, the NGO position on this seems to be to promote a target, but oppose the technologies (nuclear/CCS) that the CCC says are needed to meet it. So any complaints about the government ignoring CCC advice on electricity in 2030 are somewhat inconsistent.</p> <p>A key to this discussion is the European Emissions Trading Scheme. We don't know what will happen to it post 2020, so it seems remarkably foolish for the UK to agree to unilateral emissions cuts in electricity. After all the EU could fail to agree a tough cap for the ETS post 2020. A simple consequence is that the decarbonisation target may just result in the UK paying extra for wind and nuclear so that Poland and Germany can burn more coal. And if the EU does agree to a tough ETS cap (and make reforms) then what is the point of the decarbonisation target? </p> <p><a href=\"http://carboncounter.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Wilson</a></p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adbcafe4b00a6ab14f1e22\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T11:08:47.925+01:00\">11.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/about-the-cbi/meet-the-senior-team/katja-hall/\">Katja Hall</a>, the CBI's chief policy director, set out her views, including her specific thoughts on the decarbonisation amendment:</p> <blockquote> <p>The energy bill remains the best instrument for government to give investors the certainty they need to plough billions of pounds into keeping UK lights on, through an affordable low-carbon economy. We can&rsquo;t afford further delays, so it is essential there&rsquo;s political agreement and the bill is on the statute book this year. The government will need to make sure that households and businesses most vulnerable to increased energy prices are adequately protected.</p> <p>The CBI supports the Climate Change Act and the carbon targets and budgets contained in it, but the bill must deliver the necessary pace of decarbonisation if they are to be achieved. It is clear that investment decisions will stand or fall on the details of the contracts for difference, the capacity mechanism, and the levy control framework &ndash; not on a carbon intensity target. Debates about the effect of including a target in the bill should not be allowed to prevent critical policy details being tied down.

The requirement for an effective decarbonisation of electricity generation in the UK by 2030 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-carbon-target-delay-live\">was dropped from the energy bill at an early stage</a>, but an amendment to be debated on Tuesday afternoon, at the bill's third reading, would restore the target.</p> </blockquote> <p>The article includes reaction from two leading environmental NGOs...</p> <p><strong>Greenpeace:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Lib Dems must ensure that come the next election, the energy bill is something they can be proud of, rather than an additional thing they must defend on the doorstep,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist and policy director of Greenpeace UK. \"For the sake of households struggling with gas bills, and for the sake of the climate, they must not allow clean energy to be another concession to the Tory right...\"</p> <p>Investors in low-carbon power generation were being scared off by the lack of a decarbonisation goal and the coalition government's seeming lack of support for clean energy, Parr said. \"Without the target, there is no certainty for the low-carbon sector, a sector that provided over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011-12. [As it stands] the energy bill leaves the door open for dirty coal and gas power stations to stay online for decades, which will blow the UK's carbon budgets,\" said Parr.</p> <p>\"This is a key opportunity for the Lib Dems to push for a win for business and the economy and to differentiate themselves from their coalition partners. If they don't, the UK could end up locked into a high-carbon, gas-dependent energy system that fatally undermines the Climate Change Act. Voters who care about the environment &ndash;which is nearly all potential Lib Dem voters &ndash; may never forgive them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Friends of the Earth:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, argued the target was needed to avert a \"dash for gas\", which many on the right of the Tory party favour as an alternative to clean energy. He said: \"MPs from all parties must vote in favour of a clean power target. As well as tackling climate change and creating thousands of jobs, it will save householders billions of pounds compared to a dash for gas.\"</p> <p>Pendleton added: \"Investors say that they need certainty so they can make long-term investments in clean British energy. Without it we risk losing business overseas to countries that have made a clear commitment to developing a low-carbon future.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adb828e4b00a6ab14f1e1c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T10:49:29.197+01:00\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the thoughts of Nick Molho, head of energy policy at <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF UK</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It&rsquo;s of course theoretically possible for the UK to meet its goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 without setting a clear target to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. But given that delivering a near carbon-free power sector over the next 20 years is going to be essential to put the UK economy on a cost-effective track to meeting the 2050 climate goals, it&rsquo;s difficult to see how this will happen without the energy bill providing a long-term framework to attract the huge amounts of low-carbon investment required.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s worth restating the three key reasons why taking early action to reduce power sector emissions makes sense. First, the more we delay action to reduce emissions after 2030, the more expensive reducing our emissions will become as we will leave ourselves with an awful lot to do and very little time to do it in. Having a near-decarbonised power sector by 2030 still requires UK emissions to go down by a substantial 60% in the period between 2030 and 2050: adding more to this would not be economically sensible. Second, we already have a range of low-carbon power technologies that are either commercially available or at an advanced development stage. Third, other parts of the economy such as transport and heating will increasingly need to run on low-carbon electricity to reduce their own emissions.</p> <p>As things stand, if you have a renewable energy project that will be completed by 2020, then you know with a reasonable amount of certainty that your project will get the revenue it needs because the UK is bound by a renewable energy target for 2020 and the levy control framework out to 2020 has been announced. The lack of a decarbonisation target is also less of an issue for projects that have long-development times but have low capital costs.</p> <p>However, the lack of a decarbonisation target seriously risks delaying investments in projects that have long development times and high capital costs (such as some of the late Round 3 offshore wind projects that will be completed in the early 2020s) or in the renewable energy / low-carbon supply chain, which require several years of operation to recover the initial investment. A delay in these investments would result in not only slowing down the construction in low-carbon capacity that we need but it would also undermine the cost reductions and economic growth benefits that investment in a domestic supply chain would bring.</p> <p>Clearly, providing investment certainty is not just about a decarbonisation target. To have meaning, a target needs to be accompanied with certainty that funding for low-carbon projects will grow at an appropriate rate out to 2030 and that the contractual measures introduced in the energy bill will continue to be available out to 2030.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adb308e4b04bdb0ac16ce3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T10:29:33.139+01:00\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's what the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a>, the body which formally advises the government on emissions targets, said (<a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1720_EMR_report_web.pdf\">pdf</a>) just two weeks ago on the matter of providing more confidence to energy sector investors:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Extensive decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030 is feasible and economically desirable.</strong><br />&ndash; <em>Considerations on the pace of decarbonisation.</em> In considering the appropriate pace of decarbonisation to 2030 the aims should be: to stimulate investment in cost-effective low-carbon technologies (i.e. where these are cheaper over their lifetimes than unabated gas facing a carbon price); to develop less-mature technologies; to avoid stop-start investment; and to prepare for meeting the 2050 target to reduce economy-wide<br />emissions by 80% relative to 1990.</p> <p><em>&ndash; Conclusions on the pace of decarbonisation.</em> Based on the latest evidence on costs and feasibility, we continue to conclude that aiming to achieve a carbon intensity of around 50 gCO2/kWh in 2030 through investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies is feasible and desirable. There should be some flexibility to adjust this objective based on new information, for example up to 100 gCO2/kWh if costs for emerging technologies fall less quickly than expected, or if roll-out of energy efficiency, nuclear and onshore wind are more constrained...</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Improving conditions for investment.</strong></p> <p>In order to improve conditions for investment in the UK power sector the government should: set in legislation this Parliament a 2030 carbon-intensity target embodying the objective to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies...</p> <p><em>&ndash; Carbon-intensity target.</em> This should provide a balance of confidence and incentives to industry, signalling the government&rsquo;s intention to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies to 2030, subject to build rates and cost reductions being achieved. <em>Plan A</em> should be to reduce the carbon intensity of power generation to a level of the order of 50 gCO2/kWh by 2030. A <em>Plan B</em> that achieves a carbon intensity of up to 100 gCO2/ kWh while maintaining a portfolio approach might become appropriate, for example if costs fall less quickly than currently envisaged, or if achievable build rates are lower than expected. This could be captured through some flexibility to change the target in light of new information or by legislating a target range of 50-100 gCO2/kWh, with clear criteria to guide which end of the range will be appropriate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51adaa39e4b04bdb0ac16cd3\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-04T09:57:02.750+01:00\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At around 4pm this afternoon MPs are due to vote on whether to include a rebel amendment in the third reading of the energy bill that would see the virtual decarbonisation of the UK's electricity supply by 2030.</p> <p>The MPs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/feb/08/tory-mp-amendment-energy-bill\">co-sponsoring the amendment</a> - the Conservative's Tim Yeo and Labour's Barry Gardiner - argue that their \"carbon intensity target\" (in effect, a limit by 2030 of 50 grams of CO2 emitted per Kwh) would reduce risks for power sector investors and also better enable the nation to met its legally enshrined target of achieving an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050.

No one knows with certainty - despite what they might tell you - what the price of oil, gas, nuclear, etc, is going to be a decade from now. Therefore, all such assumptions and projections must be viewed with a degree of scepticism and perspective.</p> <p>The battles between Decc and its critics over the cost of its low-carbon energy policies will no doubt continue, but the report performs the important task of breaking down our energy bills into categories. Personally, I would like to see this information shown on energy bills today and I join those in calling for more transparency for consumers about the various components that make energy the price is it today.</p> <p>The UKERC report clearly shows that there is plenty of support for the government's low-carbon energy policies, but this could be undermined if the public is shielded from the costs. Honesty will also help to muffle those who try to claim - as has been seen today in some reporting of RWE npower's report - that bill rises are all down to green policies. The report shows that not to be true. What it does do is breakdown the individual costs of various green policies today, as well as other factors, which can only be useful.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e5753be4b0d403fb03badb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T17:30:51.347+01:00\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mike Landy, senior policy analyst at the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\">Renewable Energy Association</a>, has sent me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The truth is nobody really knows how exactly how quickly fossil fuel costs are going to rise. Neither do we know exactly how quickly renewable energy costs are going to fall. But we do know that both these things have been happening historically and we can expect that to continue into the future. Solar PV and onshore wind have shown particularly impressive cost reductions in recent years as their markets has developed, while world energy demand and the cost of fossil extraction continue to increase &ndash; and that&rsquo;s without accounting for the huge environmental costs of fossil fuels. At some point those two lines will cross &ndash; the so-called grid parity point for power.&nbsp;Thereafter the cost case in favour of the renewable option becomes increasingly compelling as time goes on.</p> <p>The only uncertainty is exactly when the cross-over will take place.&nbsp;A subsidy is required in the run-up to the cross-over, but after that the marginal energy price is set by the renewable option, providing a ceiling against which everything else will be compared.&nbsp;That day is getting closer and closer &ndash; we just need a bit a patience and perseverance!</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e57097e4b0d403fb03bad9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T17:11:04.081+01:00\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/article3045\">new report</a> by the UK Energy Research Centre is certainly worth a read. The report's authors asked 1,800 respondents to complete <a href=\"http://my2050.decc.gov.uk/\">Decc's My2050 tool</a>, which allows each user to create their own energy \"pathway\" using a combination of 14 different energy options to reduce UK emissions by 80% by 2050. The results are shown from page 11 onwards:</p> <blockquote> <p>The British public wants to see a reduction in fossil fuel use over the next few decades with a substantial majority believing that a future energy system primarily reliant on fossil fuels is unacceptable. There is very little variability in this opinion reflecting a core aspiration to transition away from fossil fuel energy to renewable forms. We note that 80% of respondents significantly reduced fossil fuels (selecting either levels 2 or 3 in the online tool) in their My2050 pathways.</p> <p>Fossil fuels are seen as polluting, archaic, finite and particularly in the case of oil are associated with global conflicts. There is some evidence that these concerns extend to unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas.</p> <p>Gas shows some nuances in terms of public preferences, where it is evaluated more positively than oil and coal, particularly in the context of personal use of gas central heating.</p> <p>Among the British public we find a strong preference for a shift to renewable energy systems and a corresponding move away from fossil fuels. This is a relatively clear and stable preference in the sense that renewables are always the preferred way of supplying energy for a large majority of people. Nearly 80% of respondents included high levels of offshore wind energy and other renewables in their My2050 pathways.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given the perception - stoked by some quarters of the media and certain politicians - that there is widespread public hostility to wind power, it is interesting to see that the report's findings strongly contradict this view:</p> <blockquote> <p>&bull; Wind energy is viewed favourably by a majority of the British public, in line with a desire to move to a renewable energy system. As such, wind energy plays a key role in public energy pathways with significant support for both onshore and offshore wind farms.<br />&bull; We find higher levels of support for offshore wind farms compared to onshore wind farms.<br />&bull; Publics recognise that wind energy is a technology ready to be deployed at scale. Findings also indicate under-estimation of the extent to which wind energy can contribute to electricity generation in the UK.<br />&bull; There are mixed views on whether wind farms spoil the landscape, or are good for nearby communities.<br />&bull; In line with other research, our findings indicate that support for wind energy cannot be taken-for-granted. There is a need to pay close attention to the siting of wind farms, e.g. in terms of locations, ownership, and fair process.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e567dfe4b0d403fb03bace\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T16:33:51.559+01:00\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In addition to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jul/16/green-policies-energy-bills-climate#block-51e557a4e4b0301f54015405\">Ed Davey's comments</a> reported by BusinessGreen, a spokesman at Decc has also sent me the department's reaction to some of the assumptions and calculations made by RWE npower in its report:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We believe energy efficiency policies (Energy Company Obligation) currently cost around &pound;400m less than Npower claims and their estimate for 2020 is nearly double ours.</li> <li>Npower fails to take into account the impact of energy efficiency policies - they include all of the costs but none of the savings.

One is whether gas prices will continue to increase resulting in bills going up. The other is whether electricity from renewables will be more expensive than that from gas.</p> <p>The answer to the first question is rather obvious: we do not know, and really should not pretend to know on the basis of what we want to be true. There are things that could exert significant download force on gas prices, Japan returning to nuclear and reducing it's liquified natural gas imports and the export of LNG from the US. But the impact of these things is far from clear, and our views on renewable energy have rather little to do with it.</p> <p>The answer to the second question however seems much clearer. Electricity from renewables will almost certainly be more expensive than renewables this decade. After all the cost of offshore wind is almost three times higher than the cost of electricity from gas.</p> <p>These realities hint at an obvious conclusion. You need to convince the public that they should pay extra for low carbon energy, whether it is renewables or nuclear.

DECC's central gas price projections - on which much of its future energy bill calculations are made - assume increasing gas prices. A combination of factors - DG COMP finally investigating Gazprom's over-pricing of gas, the re-activation of Japan's nuclear plant, massive reserves of gas off east Africa, the reluctance of India and China to pay current prices, the slow approval of US LNG export projects - all presage of softening of gas prices. </p> <p>However, irrespective of future gas prices, DECC has decided to pay offshore wind £155/MWh (declining over 5 years to £135). This will avoid the emission of approx. 0.4 tonne of CO2 - giving an implicit price of £387.5/tCO2 (net of other costs and benefits which tend to balance out)</p> <p>Currently, low-priced coal is displacing gas in electricity generation not only in Britain, but throughout the EU. It isn't straight forward to estimate the EU ETS emission allowance (EUA) price that would be required to force a switch from coal to gas - I would be interested in readers' estimates, but it is likely to be considerably less than £387.5/tCO2.</p> <p>This is not to say that gas is a long term solution, but, when CO2 emissions from Britain's electricity sector are increasing, it suggests that SoS Davey might be better employed working with his EU counterparts to get the EU ETS working properly, to make the EU's internal market work more effectively so as to put pressure on external suppliers and to faciliate the free trade agreement with the US which will faciliate more US gas exports, increase gas prices there and reduce the supply of low-priced coal.</p> <p>Lower gas prices will be able to bear a much higher EUA price, drive dirty coal out of electricity generation and provide the incentive for efficient renewables - and, potentially, the incentive for widespread use of CCS.</p> <p>The only problem is that the 'save the planet at all costs brigade' would go mad and the LibDems are counting on their support to avoid electoral melt-down.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T16:12:57.077+01:00\">at 4.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51e557a4e4b0301f54015405\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T15:24:36.980+01:00\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>BusinessGreen has the <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2282743/ed-davey-slams-ridiculous-npower-energy-bill-projections\">first reaction</a> from Ed Davey, the energy and climate secretary, to RWE npowers' report - and it isn't positive:</p> <blockquote> <p>Speaking to <em>BusinessGreen </em>as part of a wide-ranging interview to be published later this week, Davey criticised npower's methodology and questioned its track record on projecting the impact of energy policies on bills.</p> <p>\"If you look at the npower report, they don't really look at energy efficiency properly, that is one of the big problems; they overestimate the cost of ECO [<a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/ECO/Pages/index.aspx\">Energy Companies Obligation</a>]; they assume falling gas prices, which is a bit weird,\" he said. \"There are a few things they do, which give them a ridiculous price. We completely reject their figures.\"</p> <p>He added that there was already strong evidence that the company was overstating the impact of the ECO energy efficiency scheme on bills.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid npower has quite a bad track record,\" he said. \"Before ECO was launched they put out a report that said the cost of ECO would be &pound;3bn. To be fair, in this recent report they have the cost of ECO at &pound;1.7bn, although they don't tell anybody that they got it wrong by nearly double last year.

Npower says the government's predictions for how much people will save from energy efficiency are based on some <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23323318?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=c0a3230808-DAILY_BRIEFING&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-c0a3230808-303421281\"> \"heroic\"</a> assumptions. Npower takes the opposite approach, assuming that household energy demand will be exactly the same in 2020 as it is today.</p> <p>Npower says government policies will account for &pound;329 of a household's bill in 2020 - 78 per cent more then they account for today. The government, in contrast, says its policies will save households &pound;166 overall by 2020.</p> <p>Decc expects households to save through <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/03/decc-price-impacts-document-mark-2\">energy efficiency</a> measures such as wall insulation and installing more efficient boilers. But many of those measures are promoted through the green deal, which has so far been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/27/green-deal-energy-efficiency\"> slow</a> to catch-on.</p> <p>Decc also expects savings because of the EU products policy, which encourages energy efficiency. This should mean that as consumers replace their washing machines, televisions and lighting, the new models use less energy. But the savings don't kick in while consumer are using old appliances. Decc says it uses standard figures for the rate at which consumers tend to replace electronics, but not everyone is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9955852/Households-will-have-to-buy-green-appliances-to-benefit-from-Government-energy-bill-boasts.html\"> convinced</a>.</p> <p>While Decc may be optimistic on some measures, Npower might be pessimistic on others. A footnote on page 5 of Npower's report suggests it uses energy regulator <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Media/FactSheets/Documents1/household-bills.pdf\"> Ofgem's household gas and electricity consumption estimates</a> for 2013 in every year of its projection. That would mean energy demand doesn't ever reduce, implying the government's energy efficiency schemes have no affect at all...</p> <p>Npower's projections places blame for the cost increase at the government's feet, based on an assumption that energy efficiency policies won't deliver any reduction in demand. This is not the first time the argument has been made, and the general view seems to be that it has some merit.&nbsp;Slow take-up of the green deal programme will only reinforce that view.</p> <p>But coming from one of the big six power companies, this report may be an effort to shift blame for price hikes away from <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/02/centrica-has-reported-a-profit-its-infographic-time\"> energy company profits</a> and back onto the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e54edde4b0953646594488\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T14:47:10.312+01:00\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Twitter reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/statuses/357126177309200384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Npower document on energy inflation very interesting.. but can&#39;t help thinking the hidden message is: &quot;We&#39;re about to up bills.&quot;</p>&mdash; steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/statuses/357126177309200384\">July 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emilygosden/statuses/357082584179675136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRobertsonMP\">@JohnRobertsonMP</a> on npower/bills: &quot;If any other company needs to invest in infrastructure they reduce their profit &amp; take the hit.&quot; Really?</p>&mdash; Emily Gosden (@emilygosden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilygosden/statuses/357082584179675136\">July 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Antonia_Dickman/statuses/357090569928974338\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IpsosMORI\">@IpsosMORI</a> slides from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EnergyExplained&amp;src=hash\">#EnergyExplained</a> event on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlideShare\">@slideshare</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23consumers&amp;src=hash\">#consumers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23domesticenergy&amp;src=hash\">#domesticenergy</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/lbzYyjvhjH\">http://t.co/lbzYyjvhjH</a></p>&mdash; Antonia Dickman (@Antonia_Dickman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antonia_Dickman/statuses/357090569928974338\">July 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/James_BG/statuses/357079494575665155\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Positioning of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npowerhq\">@npowerhq</a> report is fascinating. <a href=\"https://t.co/cfoTOeZQlr\">https://t.co/cfoTOeZQlr</a> Looks like reasonable attempt to make case for efficiency+investment</p>&mdash; James Murray (@James_BG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_BG/statuses/357079494575665155\">July 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cse_bristol/statuses/357073030343692289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dpcarrington\">@dpcarrington</a> In our view, npower analysis doesn&#39;t take fully into account improved domestic energy efficiency as a result of policies</p>&mdash; CSE (@cse_bristol) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cse_bristol/statuses/357073030343692289\">July 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/npowerhq/statuses/357064215443415040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Our CEO Paul Massara has written a blog about our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EnergyExplained&amp;src=hash\">#EnergyExplained</a> report.

It sees gas prices rising from 61 pence per therm in 2012 to almost 72 pence per therm by 2020 and levelling out thereafter (\"Decc Fossil Fuel Price Projections\" Oct 2012).</p> <p>By assuming real fuel prices will continue to rise strongly, Decc's scenarios show major financial benefits from switching to alternatives like wind and solar as well as investing in energy conservation measures such as better home insulation.</p> <p>The problem is that Decc's assumptions seem to be stuck in a time-warp. They are based on peaking oil and gas supplies and rising costs. Decc's central scenarios make no allowance for the shale boom or a structural break in oil and gas prices in the future.</p> <p>Decc's price scenarios appear outdated and flawed. So far in 2012 and 2013, futures markets have put the cash price of a barrel of oil delivered in December 2019 at just $89-90, far below Decc's inflation-adjusted central scenario of $123.50 let alone it's high scenario of $150.60.</p> <p>Futures prices have even been slightly below Decc's low scenario, based on assumptions about production costs...</p> <p>If RWE npower's report shines some welcome transparency on the make-up of utility bills, and prompts a discussion about the costs and benefits of various interventions in the energy market, as well as assumptions about future fuel prices, it will have made a major contribution to Britain's energy debate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e54469e4b0f0282112e474\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T14:02:34.162+01:00\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a response by <a href=\"http://www.fuelpovertyaction.org.uk\">Fuel Poverty Action</a>, which is a \"grassroots campaign group, working with pensioners, disabled people and others among the worst affected by rocketing energy bills\":</p> <blockquote> <p>We completely reject the idea that the costs of 'green measures' like clean energy and energy efficiency are a significant factor behind rising energy bills. Instead, the problem is the rising cost of gas and the profiteering of the Big Six. <br />According to the Committee on Climate Change, bills increased by an average of &pound;360 between 2004 and 2011. The CCC's estimate is that just ten per cent of this increase was down to the costs of clean energy, while sixty per cent of this increase was due to the rising cost of gas. The CCC also predict that the government's plans to build a new generation of gas power stations would add hundreds of pounds more to our bills over coming decades than the alternative of mass investment in clean energy. If the 'dash for gas' goes ahead, bills could rise by as much as &pound;600 by 2050. In contrast, a rush for renewables would see bills rise by just &pound;100 by 2020, before starting to fall in 2030. [1] <br />For years now, the Big Six have been blaming the costs of green energy in an attempt to divert attention from the real sources of the problem. The Big Six doubled their profit-margins in the last year alone. What's more, their investments and business models rely on the expansion of fossil fuels for decades to come, irrespective of their rising costs and the grave dangers of climate change. Today's news that around four in five people in the UK want to reduce fossil fuel usage, with similar numbers supporting renewables, just goes to show that people do not believe the lies.

Renewables get very unfairly blamed for increasing energy bills by the UK media. The Guardian is better than most, but much of the media is having entirely the wrong debate. It should be focussed on the massive &pound;200+ added to bills over the last 2 years mostly by rising gas prices, and why the UK lags nearly the whole of Europe in renewable energy production.</p> <p>Decc ministers to their credit do explain the facts; that it is gas volatility that has been by far the most responsible for painful bill rises. However, we'd like to see ministers explain that households can be increasingly independent in energy production given they are so unhappy with big energy companies. The government has made it relatively easy to self-supply with solar PV and, just last week, with renewable heat. The more people invest, the cheaper self-supply will become. In many ways it is the scale of ambition and investment in renewables&nbsp;that will determine energy costs in future.</p> <p>There is much more to household prosperity than energy bill costs. Rather than spending billions on ever-larger foreign imports of fossil fuels, investment in renewable energy allows us to reinvest our own resources in domestic energy&nbsp;production, meaning 100,000s of local&nbsp;jobs, energy security and much better price stability in future. Looking at bills is only one side of the story. The benefits of investment in domestic renewable energy&nbsp;for wider national household prosperity are vast.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e541b4e4b0953646594481\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-16T13:51:08.548+01:00\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever with analysis such as this, you should always try to move beyond the headline claims and head straight for the small print.

But, as today's discussion has shown, the biomass-for-energy debate suffers from being particularly nuanced, complex and scenario rich.</p> <p>First, we must identify which biomass we are actually referring to. Waste wood? Thinnings? Miscanthus? Each demands its own careful calculation.</p> <p>Second, we must ensure that \"sustainability standards\" are rigorous, verifiable and independently audited. Judging by what I've seen today, I'm far from convinced that the biomass industry is policing itself, or being policed, forcefully enough. There is still much work to be done here, I feel.</p> <p>Third, there is the question of scale. This industry is new and yet it seems there are big plans for it in the years ahead if it is to help the UK meet its renewables targets. Biomass is already being imported from beyond the EU to feed the furnaces at power plants such as Drax. Fast forward a decade and try to imagine the scale of biomass imports that will be required. Where will all this fuel come from? Can it be scaled up sustainably without damaging habitats or displacing land used for food?</p> <p>Personally, I feel these are all still live, open questions that need to be answered fully before we can feel comfortable in claiming that burning biomass for energy is truly sustainable in the long term.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bcbe2e4b087a0919d6a5c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T17:16:34.862+01:00\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the views of David Hopkins, head of external affairs at <a href=\"http://www.ttf.co.uk/\">Timber Trade Federation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.woodforgood.com/who-we-are/\">Wood for Good</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The timber industry in the UK sees small-scale, localised biomass extraction for heat or CHP production as a useful means to encourage more woodlands into management, particularly in England (when talking on a UK basis). Many sawmills and other forestry related businesses use their own thinnings (&ldquo;waste&rdquo; to many people) to power their own operation, especially for kilning. Biomass energy in this sense and at this scale is entirely feasible and sensible. It encourages a cascade approach whereby the primary materials are used in primary markets &ndash; manufacture and construction &ndash; and discarded materials into energy.</p> <p>&nbsp;However, this is quite different from the scale of operation envisaged by Drax and others. As an industry we oppose the expansion of the biomass industry in this way for all the reasons you can find elsewhere on your blog and through this industry funded campaign: <a href=\"http://www.stopburningourtrees.org/\">http://www.stopburningourtrees.org/</a></p> <p>It is worth considering what the renewable energy subsidies are for and asking whether these criteria are met with large scale biomass. Subsidies are there to encourage new markets, encourage investment in new capital plant, and get new technologies on stream. Does this happen with the plans of large scale biomass? No!</p> <p>Most of the businesses wanting to use biomass at large scale already have power stations operating. Rather than encouraging new plant to be built then, it will allow them to cynically exploit a public subsidy regime in order to keep these old plants open and sweat their assets. It hardly encourages any new investment, new markets or new jobs in any way.</p> <p>Secondly, do we need a dedicated biomass industry? We have a functional energy-from-waste industry. The advanced thermal plants &ndash; such as gasification, pyrolysis etc &ndash; are very clean and accept a variety of feedstocks, including post consumer or post-construction wood waste. By only accepting material which is classified as &ldquo;waste&rdquo; these plants produce energy without interfering with virgin woodstocks.</p> <p>They also therefore encourage a &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; usage, meaning that wood based materials are used in their longest life use first and foremost while new stocks are grown. Only after this use are they considered for fuel use.</p> <p>The growth of biomass is having a detrimental impact on the timber and panels industry across the UK and beyond. We have an active, growing industry &ndash; in the top 10 manufacturing industries in the UK - which reduces emissions at its very outset and stores them during the working life of the products it produces. Short-sighted activity in biomass for energy threatens this for little gain.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bc9fce4b06f2158284daa\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T17:09:48.946+01:00\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Returning to the vexed issue of sustainability standards, it seems that the demand that there must be a \"minimum 60% GHG emission saving for electricity generation using solid biomass or biogas relative to fossil fuel\" is open to challenges.</p> <p>Here's a tweet by the RSPB's Harry Huyton...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Harryhuyton/status/332513098697175043\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leohickman\">leohickman</a> The 60% GHG reduction std covers harvest, transport &amp; processing but not the CO2 released on combustion.

So although the standards call for &quot;minimum 60% GHG emission saving for electricity generation using solid biomass or biogas relative to fossil fuel&quot; the standards actually make no provision for accounting in full for the emissions, so this isn't a meaningful target IMO. </p> <p>They are only saying - the emissions from biomass processing/transport and land use change alone, should add up to less than half the emissions from burning a fossil fuel alternative. You can see that if you add in the emissions from combustion as well, even if discounted in some way (as yet to be determined) because they may be temporary, there is quite a possibility that any carbon advantage will be marginal. </p> <p>This seems to be a major deficiency in the current accounting system, though I am not sure how much freedom the UK has to legislate unilaterally on this, and how much all this is set at EU level.

I work in the Biomass Heating Sector and also manage a small woodland for biodiversity so have some practical experience. The so-called 'debate' is not really a scientific debate and has become distorted due to some big biases among NGOs and others. I spent a decade working for NGOs such as GP and FOE so am quite sympathetic to these groups. I just think that right now they have lost the plot on energy. The fact that some parts of Greenpeace are saying publically that Gas power is better than bioenergy and FOE’s Mike Child’s seems ready to support nuclear power, tells me they are losing their way (and potential moral force). </p> <p>The whole debate has got completely distorted for what I believe are misguided reasons and based on bad science. The 'Dirtier than Coal?' report by the NGOs was a travesty. It was based on work by Searchinger who took the most extreme scenario, among hundreds of scenarios produced by Forest Research and North Energy Associates: <br />https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48346/5133-carbon-impacts-of-using-biomanss-and-other-sectors.pdf )<br />to show that burning trees in a power plant was 'bad'. Mortimer and Matthews the main authors asked some fundamental questions including: “Is it better to leave wood in the forest or harvest it for timber, other wood products (e.g. panel boards) and/or fuel?” They concluded that: “policy should support managing UK forests to produce wood for products and bioenergy” And that’s a balanced answer from reviewing hundreds of options and counter-factuals.</p> <p>Of course you can pick a scenario whereby if you assume that your wood fuel is 'stealing' resource from higher-value added uses (construction, furniture), and use long established hardwood sources and then assume your data based on a single stand of trees over a short timescale, well yes you will come out with some bad numbers. If however you try and think more like a forester and manage woodland properly, and assume that any tree felling and management is within part of a wider landscape of trees of different ages, then bioenergy makes a lot of sense. </p> <p>The numbers on carbon stack up and the concept of ‘carbon debt’ doesn’t hold. Recent work by Dr Martin Jungunger of Utrecht University shows that either ‘carbon debt’ doesn’t exist or it is very short even with adverse assumptions (Carbon payback period and carbon offset parity point of wood pellet production in the South-eastern United States, Jan Gerrit, Geurt Jonker, Martin Junginger and Andre Faaij, University of Utrecht).</p> <p>What is this obsession with ‘whole trees’? Thousand s of hectares of Lodgepole Pine in Scotland are growing distorted and have no higher added value? Thank god there is a pellet mill to use the wood! Come to my woods and tell me what to do with the many ‘bent’ softwood pine that have no value for construction. Leave it to rot and release the carbon and methane for no benefit or fossil fuel displacement?</p> <p>I think some people are grasping for a magic energy bullet that can pull us out of the big hole we’re in on climate change. Assuming that the NGOs still support the 2 degrees Celsius global carbon budget limit (2DS), then are they really suggesting we can run the economy on wind power (I am a supporter), solar PV and electric cars? Do they think tidal power won’t get massive opposition from other NGOs? This is just not credible and allows critics to dismiss NGOs and go all out for Gas Fracking and nuclear. Bioenergy provides a rapid transition for all sectors and doesn’t suffer from intermittency issues and is cost-effective. When I look at the £90 billion that Hinckley C might cost us via EDF, then Biopower is really cheap. </p> <p>Of course if you designed energy systems from scratch we wouldn’t start from here. While I understand that importing wood from the USA and burning it in 40% efficient power plant might seem hard for some, and we’d rather it burned in CHP plant at higher efficiency, right now we need to be doing a lot of things across the board and bioenergy has an important potential role. Importing tar sands oil from Canada is an awful lot worse. </p> <p>To dismiss bioenergy by taking extreme ‘straw men’ scenarios, which is what the NGOs have done, threatens to lose a decade on serious short-term progress on climate change. We are potentially destroying some very important carbon reduction runs by NGOs chasing headlines.</p> <p>Stewart Boyle, Senior Associate, South east Wood Fuels (SEWF)</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bc4f9e4b087a0919d6a54\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T16:47:05.728+01:00\">4.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a perspective from Greece sent in by Dr Peri Kourakli, forest task force coordinator at <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/regional/europe/index.html\">BirdLife Europe</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, we can burn trees and they can provide us with a rather stable production of electricity, but is this neutral for the environment and economice process? What do we gain?</p> <p>The majority of NGOs are finding it hard to believe that by burning trees for electricity (eg. <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/community/2013/02/the-risk-of-assuming-that-biomass-is-sustainable/\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2010/06/carbon-bomb.html\">here</a>), we are ensuring our future. But this is not only the view of NGOs. It has been declared by several and different scientific sources in recent years. As examples:</p> <p>A very <a href=\"http://ncfp.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/biomass-energy-not-sustainable-or-carbon-neutral.pdf\">recent paper</a> published proved that the use of large scale bioenergy is only resulting in younger forests, lower CO2 pools, minimization of soil nutrient stocks, loss of ecosystem functions and, of course, a serious negative balance regarding the GHG emissions (so more CO2 to the atmosphere than before!).</p> <p>The same conclusion also derived from the <a href=\"http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/bf-ca/sites/bf-ca/files/files/documents/eur25354en_online-final.pdf\">report of Joint Research Institute (JRC)</a> published just 2 months ago.</p> <p>For the case of the UK, there is an extra factor that should be taken into consideration. The UK cannot support electricity production from trees, so the wood must come from countries far far away, most probably outside Europe (so even more GHG).</p> <p>Is it cheaper to use trees for electricity production? The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; on so many levels. Resource efficiency is one of them. Large trees are valuable for replacing unrecyclable material, eg. in construction, while large trees are also the main material in everyday products (from paper to innovating products like medicine). And, of course, the industrial use of trees in the UK will definitely increase the price of wood globally!</p> <p>There is a small scale example from the Balkans region. In Greece, over the last 2 years, firewood has replaced heating oil in many houses and buildings. Greece cannot cover the current demand (sustainable forest management) so it imports from the neighbour countries. As a consequence, the price of firewood has increased 3-5 times in Bulgaria, Albania and ex-Yugoslavia countries. Locals are having difficulties in buying firewood so either they are cold during winter or they are becoming illegal loggers in order to survive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bbdb5e4b06f2158284d92\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T16:16:05.785+01:00\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I've received this comment from Nigel Burdett, head of environment at <a href=\"http://www.draxgroup.plc.uk/\">Drax</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Biomass has a critical role to play in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and can do so in a way that protects wildlife, livelihoods and guarantees emission cuts. The studies which suggest there may be a carbon debt cannot be applied to biomass from a sustainable forest because the scenarios they are quoting do not reflect the practices on the ground.&nbsp;With any model the answer produced depends on the assumptions made. If scenarios which reflect sustainable practices are used accurately we find substantial carbon savings. If scenarios which do not reflect real life practices are used the model may result in outcomes which don&rsquo;t show carbon savings. Our focus is therefore on ensuring our biomass is sustainable and <a href=\"http://www.draxpower.com/biomass/\">our policy</a> is designed to ensure that the production and delivery of our biomass will:</p> <ul> <li>Significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with coal-fired generation and give preference to biomass sources that maximise this benefit.</li> <li>Not result in a net release of carbon from the vegetation and soil of either forests or agricultural lands.</li> <li>Not endanger food supply or communities where the use of biomass is essential for subsistence (for example, heat, medicines, building materials).</li> <li>Not adversely affect protected or vulnerable biodiversity and where possible we will give preference to biomass production that strengthens biodiversity.</li> <li>Deploy good practices to protect and/or improve soil, water (both ground and surface) and air quality.</li> <li>Contribute to local prosperity in the area of supply chain management and biomass production.</li> <li>Contribute to the social wellbeing of employees and the local population in the area of the biomass production.</li> </ul> <p>Our policy is widely accepted as good practice but we also need to make sure it is being followed. The Drax procurement programme means:</p> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Rejection of all non-sustainable biomass</li> <li>Policy implemented in practice through <ul> <li>Risk assessment on country risk</li> <li>Pre-contract audits</li> <li>Formal data collection by supplier</li> <li>Data part of contract</li> <li>Post-contract updates</li> <li>Post-contract audits (independent third party) <ul> <li>Compliance</li> <li>Policy and risk areas</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Annual external ISAE300 audit</li> </ul> </ul> </ul> </ul> <p>Using this real information we conduct life cycle analysis and in 2012 the average greenhouse gas saving over the full life cycle resulting from burning sustainable biomass in place of coal was above 80%.</p> <p>On carbon balance, the key thing is that the rate of carbon absorption is greater than extraction, it is not a case of waiting for a new tree to re-grow so carbon balance is maintained. For example, in 2012 the US EPA reported that forest carbon sequestration in the US had increased 31 per cent since 1990 even as demand for wood increased.</p> <p>In fact, taking the US as an example:</p> <ul> <li>US forest growth has exceeded harvest for the each of the last 50 years.</li> <li>Standing volume increased 49 per cent from 1952 to 2006 even though there has been an increase in harvest level to feed industrial demand over the same period.</li> <li>The US forest estate now stands at 751 million acres of forest with net volume per acre increasing by 94 per cent since 1953. This is almost identical to the coverage in 1910. Of the 751m acres, 200m are in the South East US where a lot of our woody biomass will come from.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bb86ee4b087a0919d6a3a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T15:53:35.240+01:00\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There seems to be some concern and debate about the \"sustainability standards\" for the burning of biomass for electricity generation. Here's what the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/sustainability-standards-for-electricity-generation-from-biomass\">said in January</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since 1 April 2011, biomass electricity generators over 50KW have been required to report against the following sustainability criteria:</p> <ul> <li>minimum 60% GHG emission saving for electricity generation using solid biomass or biogas relative to fossil fuel</li> <li>general restrictions on using materials sourced from land with high biodiversity value or high carbon stock &ndash; including primary forest, peatland, and wetlands</li> </ul> <p>Following a 2-year transition period, we intend that from October 2013 generating stations of 1 megawatt (MW) capacity and above will be required to meet the criteria in order to receive Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the RO.</p> <p>This transition period allows generators time to familiarise themselves with the sustainability criteria and reporting process.</p> </blockquote> <p>Generators are obliged to \"provide information to Ofgem on sustainability criteria with regard to greenhouse gas reductions and prior land use for the biomass used\". This Ofgem document provides the specific standards:</p> <blockquote> <p>To comply with the land criteria, the biomass cannot be obtained from land that:</p> <ul> <li>at any time during or after January 2008 was primary forest;</li> <li>at any time during or after January 2008 was land designated for nature protection purposes (unless production of that biomaterial did not interfere with purposes for which this land was designated);</li> <li>at any time during January 2008 was peatland (unless the cultivation and harvesting of biomaterial did not involve the drainage of previously undrained soil);</li> <li>was a continuously forested area at any time during January 2008 and was not a continuously forested area when the biomaterial was obtained from it;</li> <li>was a lightly forested area at any time during January 2008 and was not a lightly forested area or a continuously forested area when the biomaterial was obtained from it, except where the fuel made from the biomaterial was not a bioliquid and the greenhouse gas emissions from the use of the fuel to generate one mega joule of electricity did not exceed 79.2 grams;32 or</li> <li>at any time during January 2008 was a wetland area and was not a wetland area when the biomaterial was obtained from it...</li> </ul> <p>For an operator to meet the GHG criteria, the emissions associated with the biomass should be less than or equal to 79.2g CO2eq/MJ electricity.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's what it has to say on the crucial issue of verification (pg 20). I can't pretend that I'm particularly reassured by 2.19...</p> <blockquote> <p>2.19. Under the Orders, operators of generating stations for solid and gaseous biomass are not required to verify the information they provide to us in order to be eligible for ROCs. However, operators do need to be confident that they are providing us with accurate and reliable information, to the best of their knowledge and belief.<br />2.20. Although it is not mandatory for an operator to verify processes under the Orders, a European Commission (EC) Communication on voluntary schemes sets out how voluntary schemes can be used to verify information should an operator choose to do so. An operator may use more than one voluntary scheme to support or supplement the information on the Orders‟ sustainability criteria.<br />2.21. In relation to the land criteria, an operator can use voluntary schemes recognised by either the EU or the UK, to undertake verification. If there are no voluntary schemes available, an operator can also collect information relating to the land use during or after January 2008 depending on the feedstock.<br />2.22. In terms of GHG criteria, there are currently no voluntary schemes which address these criteria. As a result, information on the GHG criteria should be provided by using the GHG calculation methodology and default values or actual data.<br />2.23. We understand that issues around verification may also form part of the government‟s consideration of possible amendments to the Orders scheduled for 2013.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518bae01e4b087a0919d6a2b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T15:09:05.678+01:00\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dr Matthew Aylott, who works for the <a href=\"http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/\">National Non-Food Crops Centre</a> and helped to write the government&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/may/09/biomass-burn-trees-generate-electricity#block-518b9e38e4b06f2158284d5c\">Bioenergy Strategy</a>, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/renewablewriter/status/332489066958450689\">tweeted a link</a> to a briefing paper he wrote last December and has also sent me this comment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Biomass will be essential in keeping the lights on in the UK as our ageing coal-fired power stations come to the end of their lives.

Big biomass on the scale currently proposed will result in more forest destruction, more land-grabbing, continued or increased poor air quality for areas with converting coal plants or new biomass plants, and increased carbon emissions at a time when they should be coming down. Far from the renewable, low-carbon energy that government and industry hails it as, big biomass is nothing more than greenwash.</p> <p>The current expansion is the result of a number of incentives provided to the industry, none of which are aimed at genuine carbon emission reductions. These are:</p> <p>Number 1: The government has no credible plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and there's no incentive for energy companies to do the same. Therefore, biomass carbon accounting errors in the form of ignoring carbon debt and land use changes makes carbon reduction targets much more achievable without having to change anything fundamental. Governments have a duty to spell out what climate change means and what it takes to address it - promoting Big Biomass as a climate solution is a clear dereliction of that responsibility.</p> <p>Number 2: There's big money in it. ROCs (Renewable Obligation Certificates) are being thrown at power stations. These so-called renewable subsidies will see Drax netting over <strong>half a billion pounds each year</strong> from its half-conversion to biomass. Bill-payers will foot the cost of these subsidies through energy price rises, at a time of squeezed household budgets and rapidly rising fuel poverty.</p> <p>Number 3: adding biomass to the mix reduces the sulphur emissions of coal-fired power stations such that they can comply with EU air quality targets, and can keep operating and not close like Didcot and Cockenzie recently did. Sulphur dioxide emissions from power stations are strictly regulated, whereas (oddly) carbon dioxide emissions are not. Drax burning biomass means Drax can continue to burn coal long into the future, as their investors seem to want. And it's not just Drax - E.On and RWE are also converting power stations to biomass that would otherwise be shut down.</p> <p>Biofuelwatch has been warning of the problems with big biomass for several years. Dozens of articles and scientific papers are collated on our website here &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/resources-on-biomass/\">http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/resources-on-biomass/</a>, including our own report &ldquo;Sustainable Biomass: A Modern Myth&rdquo; here <a href=\"http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2012/biomass_myth_report/\">http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2012/biomass_myth_report/</a>.</p> <p>World Rainforest Movement's recent paper shows what UK and EU consumption of wood for energy is likely to mean for the Global South - <a href=\"http://www.wrm.org.uy/publications/Tree_plantations_in_the_South_to_generate_energy_in_the_North.pdf\">Tree plantations in the South to generate energy in the North</a> (<a href=\"http://www.wrm.org.uy/publications/Tree_plantations_in_the_South_to_generate_energy_in_the_North.pdf\">www.wrm.org.uy/publications/Tree_plantations_in_the_South_to_generate_energy_in_the_North.pdf</a>)</p> <p>Finally, there is clear evidence, published by Dogwood Alliance (<a href=\"http://www.dogwoodalliance.org/2012/11/new-report-discredits-uk-energy-company-claims-that-pellets-come-from-wood-waste/\">http://www.dogwoodalliance.org/2012/11/new-report-discredits-uk-energy-company-claims-that-pellets-come-from-wood-waste/</a>) that pellet plants supplying UK energy companies are using whole trees and not relying on residues.

Two years ago, the RSPB and other NGOs published a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ieep.eu%2Fassets%2F856%2FIEEP_UK_responsible_bioenergy.pdf&amp;ei=6JyLUZ_BMMab1AWi0oHIAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaqCLf0F2AwH176O-EWzshhJFXZw&amp;sig2=CuR-zshOiODMcMUczooRt\">report</a> on this that laid out a positive vision for the sector largely based on using wastes like food and wood waste, agricultural residues like straw and olive pips, as well as residues from the forestry industry.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is not the way the industry is developing; instead government support is being directed towards large-scale electricity generation by partially or completely converting coal power stations over to biomass. This biomass will principally be derived from wood. In fact, last year, Ofgem report that 3.6 million tonnes of biomass was combusted in the UK, 76% of which was wood.</p> <p>This is only good news for the climate if that wood is all wastes or residues left over from existing forestry activities. If the wood was harvested specifically for energy then it results in high carbon emissions. The reason for this is simple: when wood is burnt in a power station, CO2 is released into the atmosphere. For a long time, calculations of greenhouse gas emissions from biomass simply ignored these emissions, based on the assumption that the CO2 is immediately neutralised by regrowth in the forest from which the wood was harvested.</p> <p>This is clearly incorrect, and many studies have demonstrated this. For example, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2012.01197.x/full\">Bernier &amp; Par&eacute; (2013)</a> modelled the net CO2 emissions from harvesting a Canadian boreal forest for bioenergy and calculated that they are neutralised by regrowth only after 90 years. <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/m818k271ml24696t/fulltext.pdf\">Holltsmark (2012)</a> showed that increasing harvest rates in a typical boreal forest for biofuel production creates a &ldquo;carbon debt that takes 190&ndash;340 years to repay&ldquo;</p> <p>There&rsquo;s plenty more papers like these. In addition, the European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre recently published <a href=\"http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/bf-ca/sites/bf-ca/files/files/documents/eur25354en_online-final.pdf\">a scientific review of carbon emissions from biomass</a>. They concluded that &ldquo;<em>The assumption of biogenic carbon neutrality is not valid&rdquo;. </em>This follows <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas/view\">a review in 2011 by the European Environment Agency</a>, which reached similar conclusions.</p> <p>Effectively, burning wood from trees harvested specifically for energy results in a spike in emissions that is only neutralised over long periods of time. This isn&rsquo;t compatible with our goal of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change, which requires global emissions to peak over the next couple of years and then decline.</p> <p>In response to this evidence, many in the industry have argued that they won&rsquo;t use &lsquo;whole trees&rsquo;. Instead, they&rsquo;ll stick to residues, arisings, straw, nutshells, olive pips and such like. The question is: is this credible? Here are a few reasons why we don&rsquo;t think it is (unless we all eat a lot more olives...)</p> <p>Firstly, government&rsquo;s own statistics show whole trees were burnt in power stations last year &ndash; at the moment its voluntary for generators to report on whether they used whole trees or arisings, but 135,000 tonnes of roundwood (i.e. the tree trunk) was reported to have been burnt in power stations last year.</p> <p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s already evidence that US wood pellet companies use whole trees. The Dogwood Alliance, a US based NGO dedicated to the conservation of the Southern forests, published <a href=\"http://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Whole-Tree-Wood-Pellet-Production-Report.pdf\">a report</a> last year documenting evidence of US pellet plants that supply the UK using whole trees. As an example, Georgia Biomass - which provides Tilbury coal power plant with wood - takes in &ldquo;more than 1 million metric tons of logs annually&rdquo;.</p> <p>Thirdly, whilst it's a good thing to use residues and wastes for energy, they are a limited resource. For example, using all of the arisings from UK forestry for electricity would only generate about 0.9% demand. Useful, but a fraction of the scale of government&rsquo;s plans.</p> <p>Finally, the industry has objected to our suggestion that subsidies be given only to the use of residues, arisings and wastes, which doesn&rsquo;t suggest they are completely confident that they won&rsquo;t use anything else.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518b9f50e4b087a0919d6a0d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T14:06:25.427+01:00\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a> has sent me the following comment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greenpeace is supportive of the use of bioenergy &ndash; but it has to be sustainable and genuinely contribute to tackling climate change.

Sadly, this has largely been ignored, and instead of a prescription for sustainability, we have a proposition of <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/Bioenergy_a_burning_issue_1_tcm9-288702.pdf\">large scale imports</a> of wood into UK because there is no prospect of us being able to meet the volume of demand, with sustainability standards that <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/biomass_report_tcm9-326672.pdf\">omit key issues</a>.</p> <p>The two key issues highlighted are carbon debt and indirect use change. An example of the former is that an area of forest that is clearcut is not a low-carbon form of energy &ndash; it is high carbon until the emissions are reabsorbed by the re-growing forest. An example of the latter would be if wood is diverted out of the construction sector and is replaced by (high-carbon) concrete.</p> <p>Neither UK or EU regulations deal with these issues. Recently, the review of science by the <a href=\"http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/bf-ca/sites/bf-ca/files/files/documents/eur25354en_online-final.pdf\">European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre</a> concluded that under current carbon accounting conventions &ldquo;the assumption of biogenic carbon neutrality is not valid under policy relevant time horizons&rdquo; for imports. The <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas/view\">European Environment Agency Scientific Committee</a> had expressed the same concerns. And now provisional results (see slide 20) of <a href=\"https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/carbon-sequestration-and-storage/articles/-/blogs/decc-biomass-feedstock-carbon-calculator-workshop-1;jsessionid=67D6006AC430E85419E75E0998070298.1e097fe6c57\">DECC&rsquo;s own draft emissions calculator</a> comes to similar conclusions.</p> <p>Given the <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests\">long history of Greenpeace campaigns to safeguard forests</a> against damage and clearance, we do not accept the idea that corporate responsibility will manage these complex issues, nor that all forest managers will be benign, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/forest-solutions-saving-great-bear-rainforest-20130411\">even in developed countries</a>. Without legally enforceable standards, bioenergy looks set to be a good idea gone bad.</p> <p>In the short term, government should not approve new sustainability standards until the analysis and implications of research from the unit of Decc&rsquo;s chief scientist is properly completed and integrated. The UK is important internationally because, along with the Netherlands, we have plans that involve a heavy dependence on imported bioenergy to meet renewable energy targets.

(Planting fresh crops to burn, waiting for them to grow, then burning them, can be low carbon, so long as you have a adequate supply of land that genuinely isn't needed for anything else. In a hungry world with rapidly shrinking biodiversity and daily extinctions, I don't think we do have enough 'spare land' to meet our energy needs, though this could be an option in some places.)</p> <p>Diverting biomass from existing uses usually does have a GHG impact, depending on what the &quot;alternative use&quot; was. Are you diverting biomass from products (potentially very bad news GHG wise, as you are losing sequestration AND possibly leading to more emissions in manufacture of substitutes like plastic or steel); are you harvesting from land that would otherwise be left untouched, or harvested less intensively, and might even be actively sequestering carbon in the plants and soil (which your harvest may well disrupt, at least in the short term)? Or are you burning &quot;residues&quot; that might not actually be destined for landfill, but would slowly decompose, partly to GHG, yes, but partly to become the soil carbon of the future (see http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827581.2011.615337 Greenhouse gas balance of harvesting stumps and logging residues for energy in Sweden and http://www.metla.fi/silvafennica/full/sf44/sf441051.pdf - or any compost heap, for that matter).</p> <p>Unless we at least attempt to find the answers to these questions, we cannot make sweeping statements about &quot;the active carbon cycle&quot; meaning that burning biomass is &quot;carbon neutral&quot;. There is enough carbon locked up in &quot;the active carbon cycle&quot; to do a huge amount of climate damage for centuries - if the balance is shifted towards the atmosphere too rapidly, by burning too much biocarbon at once. That is why we don't want to burn down the rainforests, even though they are all &quot;biocarbon&quot; after all.</p> <p>An important point that is almost always overlooked is that temporary emissions, such as you get from burning biomass that subsequently regrows, causes a permanent addition of heat to the planetary system (see http://www.oxfordenergy.org/2011/07/cumulative-carbon-emissions-and-climate-change-has-the-economics-of-climate-policies-lost-contact-with-the-physics/). The climate forcing impact of a greenhouse gas is measured in tonne years, as it is equivalent to having a heater on for a certain length of time. Turning a heater on then turning it off again is NOT equivalent to never turning it on, though both are &quot;heater neutral&quot; after the heater has been turned off. </p> <p>I would also question the habitual comparison of burning biomass with burning fossil fuels. Biomass is atracting subsidies that might otherwise be spent on other ways to secure energy services, such as large-scale renewables or (probably even better) energy efficiency. (In fact there is good evidence that the subsidies for biomass directly cut across investment in energy efficiency, for reasons outlined here http://www.aecb.net/biomass-heat-facing-the-carbon-reality-2/ .) Why not compare the value in terms of tonnes abated per £ of bill/tax payer money spent for ALL the alternatives?</p> <p>When all of the above factors are properly taken into consideration, it may well be that some forms of biomass burning still make sense in our mission to reduce carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies. Or it might not. My contention is that, because these effects are not yet properly accounted for, at the moment we simply cannot know whether the biomass we burn is low-carbon or not (though we do already know that burning whole trees is definitely high-carbon for many decades because of the long delay before regrowth - and it looks to me as though this is already happening in at least some places, as has been aired elsewhere on these pages). </p> <p>While a lot of good analysis has been done on some (not all) these issues lately, we have yet to see the results translated into policy. For example, nothing I have seen in the policy actually PREVENTS whole trees from being burned; the only protection cited is the fact that sawlogs fetch a high price on the open market. As far as I know, no analysis of carbon stock changes, or &quot;counterfactuals&quot; (eg product displacement) is carried out before a renewables obligation payment is made, so sawlogs would not be debarred. (I'd be happy to be proved wrong, but there was nothing in the active DECC policy last time I looked, it only allowed for emissions from production and transort, and wholesale land use change.)</p> <p>As a result, we cannot know that biomass being burnt at our expense, is saving any carbon emisisons at all. Which seems a bit daft, given that that is supposedly, the point.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23397895\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/2284660\" title=\"View GlobalPal’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GlobalPal\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/2284660\" title=\"View GlobalPal’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GlobalPal</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23397895\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 May 2013 12:08pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>What is happening with the conversion of coal power stations to biomass can be likened to a carbon-offsetting scheme:</p> <p><b>Offsetting</b>. A multi-GW coal burning power station pays money into a carbon-offsetting scheme which they claim will plant trees and absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

In its Summary Grounds of Resistance, DECC stated:</p> <p><i>“36. The biomass fuel needed for this and many other installations is likely to come from outside the UK. The UK government has no way of imposing, or enforcing, a standard for ‘sustainability’ on forestry operations in other EU Member States or third countries, and to do so could involve an unlawful restraint on trade.”</i></p> <p>This admission of impotence regarding foreign forestry standards is entirely inconsistent with the recent proposals put forward for managing biomass sustainability. These proposals rely on UK-developed standards being adopted by commercial undertakings in other countries. They also depend on precise, complete and auditable tracking of biomass fuel from original source. It is delusional to believe that a multi-million tonne supply chain across several continents can be monitored in this way.</p> <p>The intention is to monitor the supply chain at the point of consumption through industry certification schemes and self-reporting by bioelectricity generators who are claiming subsidies. The many recent high profile failings of ‘light touch’ regulation are a good pointer to how well this could actually work in practice – adulterated meat supplies, unsatisfactory hospital and care home services, poor quality breast implants, banking collapses, insurance mis-selling etc.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518b93cee4b06f2158284d51\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T13:17:18.323+01:00\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/\">ActionAid</a> has sent me a comment highlighting the need to question where the biomass is sourced from:</p> <blockquote> <p>Biomass imports into the UK are projected to grow 30-fold. Where will it be sourced assuming that traditional exporters to the EU &ndash; ie North America - will also see strong internal demand? The new frontier for new biomass plantations for UK and EU consumption will not only be in Latin America but also Africa. Biomass investors are already acquiring land and plantations in Ghana, Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania. ActionAid is witnessing the same rush for land that we saw with transport biofuels with all the associated impacts on people and land rights. Biomass is not the answer, for example, in terms of fighting climate change and its negative impacts on poor people in developing countries.

In fact, sources of bioenergy could play a useful role in reducing emissions in sectors such as aviation, shipping and long-distance freight which require fuels with high energy density. In other words, biomass isn&rsquo;t just &lsquo;burning trees to generate electricity&rsquo; &ndash; biomass can also mean using biofuel as a substitute for aviation kerosene, for example.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s also important to realise that the scientific understanding of key sustainability issues such as the lifecycle carbon emissions (or &lsquo;carbon debt&rsquo;) of biomass is far from settled and is evolving rapidly. Taking this uncertainty into account, risks of unsustainable biomass use could be reduced if the following precautionary steps were taken:</p> <ul> <li>prioritising the use of biomass in those sectors of the economy that need it the most (such as high temperature heat processes in industry, long-distance freight, etc.) due to a current lack of alternatives to reduce emissions in those sectors;</li> <li>considering the introduction of sustainability criteria that take into account the &lsquo;carbon debt&rsquo; of biomass use, which would consider in particular whether the use of biomass sources will deliver a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere rather than a net reduction over a certain time frame;</li> <li>introducing a requirement to ensure that biomass-fired power plants do not emit more than 200gCO2/kWh, as previously recommended by the Committee on Climate Change;</li> <li>continue to prioritise energy efficiency improvements across the economy, as this will provide a greater choice of low-carbon technology options that can be relied on the supply side to meet energy demand</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518b8a45e4b06f2158284d46\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T12:36:38.043+01:00\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the thoughts of Kenneth Richter, <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>&rsquo;s biofuels campaigner:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bio-energy has a role to play in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. But only if it is done in a way that protects wildlife, livelihoods and guarantees emission cuts. When wood is burnt in a power station carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, just as it is with fossil fuels. But currently this pollution isn&rsquo;t counted in the government's proposed greenhouse gas standard for bioenergy use - even though it is the single largest emission associated with this form of power. The justification for this is that the carbon dioxide released is neutralised by regrowth in the forest from which the wood was harvested. But this recapture of carbon - sequestration - from regrowth and growth in the wider forest, may take many decades.</p> <p>Last month, the European Commission's science department published a major review [<a href=\"http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/bf-ca/sites/bf-ca/files/files/documents/eur25354en_online-final.pdf\">http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/bf-ca/sites/bf-ca/files/files/documents/eur25354en_online-final.pdf</a>] of the climate impact of energy from wood which showed that while energy crops, residues and wastes can be low carbon, wood from whole trees is worse than fossil fuels.</p> <p>In addition, Decc recently released a prototype greenhouse gas calculator for biomass electricity. It estimates both the net emissions released through the burning of wood and sequestration in forests over a 20-year time period. The calculator also estimates the impact on emissions if wood is used by the energy industry, instead of others uses, such as construction. The emissions for scenarios that involve the intensification of forest management for biomass - such as increasing harvest rates, or diverting wood away from other industries - mostly result in emissions that are significantly higher than fossil fuels. Only scenarios based on using residues that would otherwise be unused, and energy crops such as willow, offer significant emission reductions.</p> <p>A summary of the science around the carbon impacts of biomass from trees can be found in the joint NGO briefing, \"Biomass sustainability - key issues explained\" [<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefing_notes/burning_wood_for_power.pdf\">http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefing_notes/burning_wood_for_power.pdf</a>]; including a list of scientific literature on the issue.</p> <p>It is vital to distinguish between different forms of bioenergy based on their real carbon impacts. We are asking Decc to include their carbon calculator in the forthcoming sustainability criteria for biomass.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518b889ee4b06f2158284d43\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T12:29:34.969+01:00\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I have just received this comment from Alastair Kerr, director general of the <a href=\"http://www.wpif.org.uk/\">Wood Panel Industries Federation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>As well as the environmental arguments there are also significant economic issues with biomass subsidies to consider. The UK wood panel industry is a significant contributor to the UK&rsquo;s green economy and a vital employer in rural areas. We have been hit hard by rising wood prices since the introduction of biomass subsidies.</p> <p>If the government continues these subsidies the wood panel industry may be displaced from the UK. This will mean huge job losses and increased costs to the public when the prices of commodities like furniture rise as companies are forced to source the panels for their products from abroad. Although the energy sector plans on importing 90% of its woody biomass even 10% of wood being sourced domestically would mean the entire UK wood harvest would be diverted to biomass energy generation. Increased woodland planting and bringing more forests into active management will not prevent this outcome.</p> <p>The government is supporting an inefficient and environmentally unfriendly form of energy generation and this policy is now also having a serious economic impact.

The bioenergy strategy can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-bioenergy-strategy\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-bioenergy-strategy</a></p> <p>To qualify for government subsidy, biomass energy must demonstrate a lifecycle (i.e. whole supply chain) reduction in emissions of at least 60% compared to the emissions of the EU fossil fuel grid average. The government&rsquo;s sustainability criteria, expected to become legally binding in April 2014, will require this reduction in addition to protecting sensitive land. More information about the sustainability of biomass can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.backbiomass.co.uk/uploads/documents/Updated%20mythbuster%20booklet.pdf\">http://www.backbiomass.co.uk/uploads/documents/Updated%20mythbuster%20booklet.pdf</a></p> <p>Biomass in the UK is not a &lsquo;price maker&rsquo; in the global wood prices market, but a &lsquo;price taker&rsquo; &ndash; i.e. it does not influence the price of wood in any significant way. Wood prices have been in decline for a number of years and wood supply in the UK has risen. A short factsheet on wood prices can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.backbiomass.co.uk/uploads/documents/UK%20biomass%20and%20woodfuel%20prices.pdf\">http://www.backbiomass.co.uk/uploads/documents/UK%20biomass%20and%20woodfuel%20prices.pdf</a></p> <p>NGOs and the wood panels industry both draw on the report &ldquo;Dirtier than coal,&rdquo; by Professor Tim Searchinger, to support their claims on sustainability. The &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; used by Professor Searchinger is in fact based entirely on one theoretical scenario involving using all of the wood products in a forest for bioenergy, which does not reflect real-world practice. The original peer-reviewed research (from which the scenario was extracted) undertaken by experts for the UK Department of Energy notes this fact, and the Department was so concerned by the misuse of its data that it felt compelled to issue several clarifications and supplementary notes to set the record straight.

As you might expect, it argues that, when harvested timber is the source material, forestry management is key:</p> <blockquote> <p>If deforestation operations are used to produce fuel and no new growth is encouraged then carbon emissions will approach those of conventional fossil fuel systems - direct carbon dioxide emissions from producing 1MWh of heat energy from wood are roughly the same as for coal and significantly more than for oil and gas. If carbon stored in the soil of these forests is also burned as part of these clearance operations then higher emissions still would result. However, if forests were managed in this way, woodfuel suppliers and their customers would very soon run out of the raw material they are selling or use.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also provides a link to Ofgem's <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/FuelledStations/bbcc/Pages/bbcc.aspx\">Biomass and Biogas Carbon Calculator</a>.

It has produced a video (as it happens, presented by the Observer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lucysiegle\">Lucy Siegle</a>) explaining why it believes burning biomass is both sustainable and \"low carbon\".

This is complicated further by the fact that there are many different types of biomass. Earlier this year, Carbon Brief produced a <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/03/new-government-research-adds-to-biomass-emissions-controversy\">very helpful article</a> looking at this issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>Projecting actual biomass emissions is quite complicated, and very dependent on assumptions about what is going to be burned and where it comes from.&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, one of the main sources of biomass is wood. Trees take a long time to grow, which can produce a significant time lag between emissions being released and being absorbed. This has to be factored into calculations about emission reductions. Or, if wood is burned that otherwise would have been used for building, it could also result in extra emissions.</p> <p>This is why the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has developed a <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefing_notes/decc_biomass_carbon_calcul.xls\"> calculator</a>, which considers twelve different scenarios for producing and burning biomass and works out the associated emissions. But startlingly, the preliminary results suggest biomass generation actually produces more emissions than burning coal in five out of the twelve scenarios.&nbsp;</p> <p>This issue hasn't come out of nowhere, as calculating biomass emissions has previously proved controversial.&nbsp;</p> <p>Environmental NGOs released a report last year claiming biomass can be <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/biomass_report_tcm9-326672.pdf\"> \"dirtier than coal\"</a>, largely based on a <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/Searchinger_comments_on_bioenergy_strategy_SEPT_2012_tcm9-329780.pdf\"> paper</a> by Princeton academic Timothy Searchinger. It argues that Decc's bioenergy strategy doesn't adequately account emissions from biomass, meaning the government is \"significantly overestimating the climate benefits of generating electricity from wood\".</p> <p>Searchinger actually calculates that over a 20 year time period, the emissions from power generation using wood are 80 per cent higher than from coal - meaning biomass is obviously far from being a carbon neutral power source.</p> <p>But the analysis is based on using whole trees as biomass. This prompted a firm response from the Forestry Commission's <a href=\"http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/RESOURCES/REF_LIB_RES/PUBLICATIONS/BIOMASS%20AND%20SUSTAINABILITY/BEC%20COMMENTS%20ON%20DIRTIER%20THAN%20COAL%20REPORT%20V2.PDF\"> Biomass Energy Centre</a>, which says Searchinger's paper \"bases its main contention on the (rejected) worst case scenario, and the \"Dirtier than Coal\" report appears to base its fundamental arguments on this misleading and uninformed contribution\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Trade body the Renewable Energy Association (REA), which represents the biomass lobby, says Searchinger's paper overlooks the fact that <a href=\"http://www.backbiomass.co.uk/newsroom-story.php?id=132\">selling whole trees</a> as biomass \"would not be financially viable\" for landowners. By-products from forestry such as sawdust, bark and thinnings - known as residues - are more likely to be used, as they can't be used for anything else. The market should largely take care of excluding the types of materials Searchinger envisages being used for fuels, REA argues.&nbsp;</p> <p>The new calculator captures this disagreement. It suggests that burning biomass from residues produces less emissions than burning coal or gas, while burning whole trees produces far higher emissions than burning fossil fuels.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518b6585e4b087a0919d69c0\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-09T09:59:49.911+01:00\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK's &pound;3bn green investment bank confirmed today that during its first five months of lending the bank has given significant support to biomass projects.

It will take many billions of pounds - and time - to install the low-carbon generating capacity required to account for the winding down of unabated gas and coal.</p> <p>Will consumers tolerate this over the short-term, especially with a media that, in parts, continues to rail against the \"agenda\"?

Often the counterfactual costs of not investing in a low-carbon energy system are missing from this debate. The CCC's central conclusion that investing in low-carbon electricity generation is likely to be cheaper than continued reliance on gas is, as the committee argue, evidence based. It reaches a similar conclusion to recent UKERC analysis in its support for a 2030 electricity decarbonisation target.</p> <p>However, it is also important to acknowledge the uncertainties in the CCC analysis: if gas prices turn out to be much lower than expected and the costs of new low carbon technologies are much higher than expected (which is a distinct possibility), a different conclusion could be reached. It would be unwise to assume that there will be substantial falls in UK gas prices in the short-to-medium term - whether from the development of UK shale gas (which is itself highly uncertain) or from a general downward shift in international prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e2654e4b0371c681fa02f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T15:23:16.724+01:00\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the thoughts of Dr Jeff Chapman, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.ccsassociation.org/\">Carbon Capture and Storage Association</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>We welcome the publication of the committee&rsquo;s report on how government should resolve the uncertainties within the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/maintaining-uk-energy-security--2/supporting-pages/electricity-market-reform\">EMR framework</a>. In particular, the committee&rsquo;s analysis shows that up to 3GW of CCS should be contracted for in the first EMR delivery plan to 2019 &ndash; this would imply that all current proposed CCS projects should be built, including the two in the current CCS competition, as well as those outside the competition.</p> <p>However, at present there is little detail about the process for the projects outside the competition and we are seriously concerned that without further clarity for these projects in the near future, the sponsoring companies will be unable to justify continued investment.</p> <p>These projects must be developed in parallel to the projects in the current CCS competition, to allow a seamless transition to the second phase of CCS projects which will create the beginnings of a CCS industry for the UK.</p> <p>We therefore strongly support the recommendation in the committee&rsquo;s report that government should publish commercialisation strategies for technologies such as CCS &ndash; to give much needed confidence to investors of those projects outside the competition and beyond.</p> <p>We implore government to take on board the recommendations in this report and publish an ambitious delivery plan under the EMR framework &ndash; clearly setting out the objectives for CCS beyond the current competition. This should include a commitment to offer contracts for differences to a number of CCS projects outside the competition, to begin operating from later this decade.</p> <p>CCS is a critical part of the UK&rsquo;s low-carbon agenda and represents a major investment in UK infrastructure, creating a significant number of jobs for the UK economy. However these benefits will only be realised with a steady and continuous roll-out of CCS beyond the current competition and we therefore need to ensure that all CCS projects are kept alive and taken forward.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e1aace4b0371c681fa018\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T14:49:52.057+01:00\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One section (pg23, <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1720_EMR_report_web.pdf\">pdf</a>) of the CCC's report is particularly interesting in that it breaks down why it believes (relying on P&ouml;yry's analysis, see my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/may/23/green-energy-cheaper-gas-bills#block-519e10a3e4b0e392888614da\">earlier comment</a>) costs will fall varyingly for the different low-carbon technologies:</p> <blockquote> <p>P&ouml;yry identify potential for the costs of all technologies to come down in future through a combination of learning in deployment and de-risking leading to reductions in the cost of capital. The less-mature technologies offer the biggest opportunities for cost reduction through both of these mechanisms.</p> <ul> <li><em>Onshore wind</em>. Potential cost reductions for onshore wind are limited as the technology is already mature. There may be small gains in the cost of capital once new market arrangements are tested and proven to work, and some projects involving repowering of existing sites are likely to be cheaper than entirely new projects.</li> <li><em>Biomass conversion</em>. We have recommended, in our Bioenergy Review, that long-term use of bioenergy in the power sector should be limited without carbon capture and storage, and that biomass capacity should be focused on conversion of existing coal plants, which is likely to be limited to the near term, given the current age of these assets. We therefore do not include cost estimates for further biomass conversions beyond 2020.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Nuclear</em>. P&ouml;yry identify significant scope for costs to fall after the first plant (e.g. to &pound;60-75/MWh by 2030). This primarily reflects the premium built into &lsquo;first of a kind plants&rsquo; in both construction costs and cost of capital, in turn reflecting the challenges in deploying new nuclear projects for the first time under the UK&rsquo;s current regulatory regime, even though this has been set up to minimise costs. It also captures both domestic and international learning effects.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Offshore wind</em>. P&ouml;yry assume significant cost reductions as the technology matures (e.g. to &pound;110/MWh in 2030 under central assumptions). This partly reflects learning in construction and operation. It also reflects a significant reduction in the cost of capital as the perceived risk associated with the technology declines as the industry matures and gains experience of deployment and the new market mechanisms (i.e. from the 12.4% currently assumed to 10.4% by 2020 and closer to 9% by 2030 in line with other established technologies). Both these effects rely on continued deployment in the UK, given UK-specific conditions and market arrangements.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Carbon Capture Storage</em>. P&ouml;yry assume that costs for commercial projects in the late 2020s could be reduced to under &pound;100/MWh. This would require a concerted and successful commercialisation programme, including measures to &lsquo;commoditise&rsquo; and de-risk transport and storage infrastructure. This could reduce required rates of return to 10%, whilst construction costs are also assumed to fall with learning and a scaling up from the early demonstration plants. These cost estimates are also reliant on effective leveraging of learning from both UK and international projects. These estimates suggest that all options have the potential to be competitive with unabated gas generation facing a carbon price in the 2020s (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).</li> </ul> <p>This assessment reinforces the portfolio investment approach, which is aimed at driving down the costs of low-carbon technologies such that these become increasingly competitive with gas-fired generation over time.</p> </blockquote> <p>The more eagle-eyed among you might have spotted that solar and marine energy are not referenced above. The report later explains why:</p> <blockquote> <p>The scenarios involve limited roll-out of other renewables (e.g. marine technologies, solar) given currently high costs and limited use of imported low-carbon electricity.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's also worth seeing how the report estimates the costs for these low-carbon technologies in 2030 compared to today.</p> <p>Here's how it sees \"current costs of low-carbon technologies, relative to unabated gas\"...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ab94a824-4f6f-4c43-b75c-6328ea09e8ea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369316548664/81239838-4af7-4507-a403-2e8ab2cac7b3-460x276.png\" alt=\"Current costs of low-carbon technologies, relative to unabated gas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Current costs of low-carbon technologies, relative to unabated gas Photograph: CCC</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And here's the graphic for \"Projected costs of low-carbon technologies (2030), relative to unabated gas\"...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1dd4cd06-d686-494f-9ffa-c0944cf8fafc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369316728029/9b301ba0-e2a8-40c5-9dfc-d71e7fc06cd2-460x276.png\" alt=\"Projected costs of low-carbon technologies (2030), relative to unabated gas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Projected costs of low-carbon technologies (2030), relative to unabated gas Photograph: CCC</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here's the all-important smallprint for that graphic:</p> <blockquote> <p>Costs for projects starting construction in 2030.

The UK should be sending out similarly positive signals, so that we can maintain Britain&rsquo;s global lead in the offshore wind, wave and tidal sectors, as well as maintaining our success in onshore wind which is the most cost effective way to generate large amounts of low carbon electricity to power our homes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e10a3e4b0e392888614da\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T13:50:44.283+01:00\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A niggle to note: the CCC report relies heavily on commissioned research by <a href=\"http://www.poyry.co.uk/\">P&ouml;yry</a>, a management consultancy that specialises in the energy sector.

The <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2269638/climate-committee-warns-dash-for-gas-more-costly-than-low-carbon-energy-mix\">article is paywalled</a>, but here's an extract:</p> <blockquote> <p>Speaking to&nbsp;<em>BusinessGreen</em>, CCC chief executive David Kennedy acknowledged some commentators have been advocating precisely that course of action, calling for the world to give up on tackling climate change, but he argued that such an outcome was hugely unlikely.</p> <p>\"We have a Climate Change Act that is in primary legislation and which the government is committed to - we are planning for a carbon constrained world,\" he said, adding that the European Commission was currently working on ambitious new emission targets for 2030 and the US and China were sending \"encouraging signs\" about their commitment to climate action. \"There is no reason to assume we will not still be in a carbon constrained world through the 2020s and 2030s\"...</p> <p>Kennedy explained that the \"dash for gas\" approach delivers significantly higher overall costs of between &pound;25bn and &pound;45bn, because it requires a high build rate of low carbon energy sources in the 2030s that are unlikely to have come down in cost because a supply chain will not have been developed during the 2020s.</p> <p>Significantly, the report assumes the UK will start to develop its own shale gas resources and models a series of scenarios based on high and low global gas prices. It finds that only the lowest gas price modelled makes the gas-focused strategy cost competitive with the portfolio approach, and even then the benefits are negligible.</p> <p>Kennedy revealed the central gas price scenario used for the report was 70p/therm, in line with the International Energy Agency's \"optimistic scenario\" for high levels of new gas supplies, while the low cost gas scenario assumes a price as low as 40p/therm, which he admits is far more optimistic than the vast majority of industry projections.</p> <p>\"We would not end up regretting having invested in the low carbon portfolio, and there is the potential for a very big upside depending on the gas price,\" he said, explaining that if gas or carbon prices exceed the central scenario the economic benefit of the portfolio approach could reach &pound;100bn.</p> <p>The report looks set to spark yet another row between the green and anti-green factions within the coalition. But while he refused to get drawn into the political implications of a report that points out the numerous flaws in what is thought to be Chancellor George Osborne's preferred energy strategy, Kennedy leaves no doubt as to which side of the current energy debate has the stronger evidence base on its side.</p> <p>\"The arguments [to date] have been ideological, rather than evidence based,\" he said. \"It's important we make decisions on these different investment pathways based on the evidence.\" Equally, he is adamant that there is \"no evidence\" to support media scare stories that energy bills will double as a result of decarbonisation, just as there is scant evidence to suggest shale gas will be a game changer on the scale that has been seen in America in the UK...</p> <p>[The report] is a gauntlet thrown down to both the current coalition and whoever forms the government after the next election. A challenge to base policy on the available evidence base, rather than anti-green ideology and blind optimism that global gas prices will plummet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e0c27e4b0e392888614d7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T13:31:36.300+01:00\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michelle Hubert, the <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/\">CBI'</a>s principal policy adviser on energy and climate change, has sent me her reaction:</p> <blockquote> <p>The report rightly highlights the importance of finding the most cost-effective route to building a low-carbon economy and the potential benefits on offer to businesses and consumers if we get this right.

Without it, the CCC suggests, the drive towards adopting an ever-increasing amount of low-carbon energy sources in the decades ahead will be greatly hampered. Here's the wording from the report's executive summary (pg 9, <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1720_EMR_report_web.pdf\">pdf</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>We recommend the following package of measures that the Government should put in place to improve conditions for investment:</p> <ul> <li>Set in legislation this Parliament a target to reduce the carbon intensity of power generation to 50 gCO2/kWh by 2030, with some flexibility to adjust this in the light of new information.</li> <li>Set out strategies to support the development of less-mature technologies through to competitive deployment.</li> <li>Extend to 2030 provisions for the funding of low-carbon technologies (i.e. &ldquo;the Levy Control Framework&rdquo;).</li> <li>Publish in the Delivery Plan the amount of capacity that the Government intends to contract over the period 2014/15-2018/19, and prices that it will pay for onshore and offshore wind.</li> <li>Set out options to support mobilisation of new sources of finance, including roles for the Green Investment Bank and Infrastructure UK.</li> </ul> <p>These measures would support investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies through the 2020s, which the report indicates would result in cost savings of &pound;25-45 billion, in present value terms under central case assumptions about gas and carbon prices, rising to over &pound;100 billion with high gas and carbon prices.<br />The alternative strategy would be to focus on investment in gas-fired generation in the 2020s, followed by investment in low-carbon technologies in the 2030s. This would result in cost savings only in the event that gas prices were to fall significantly, or with low carbon prices, and even then such savings would be limited.<br />Only if the world were to abandon attempts to limit the risk of dangerous climate change would there be significant cost savings from a strategy focused on investment in gas-fired generation.<br />The initial incremental cost to consumers of the recommended carbon-intensity target is around &pound;20 per year for the typical household in 2030 compared to 2020, following which potentially significant cost savings would ensue.<br />A failure to commit to this now can be justified only on the assumption of low gas prices. It would be a bet on an outcome that is the opposite of most expectations. Even if the proposition were to be true, and low gas prices were to ensue, investment in gas-fired generation through the 2020s would offer very limited cost savings. Such an approach would also lock out the much higher benefits from investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies in more likely scenarios.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519df7d3e4b0371c681f9ff1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T12:04:51.797+01:00\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nick Molho,&nbsp;head of energy and climate change policy at <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/press_centre/?uNewsID=6604\">WWF-UK</a>, who I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/may/23/green-energy-cheaper-gas-bills#block-519dec82e4b0371c681f9fe2\">quoted earlier</a>, has sent me some further thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The recommendations of the CCC on long-term volume and financial certainty for new low-carbon technologies are spot on. If implemented, they could play a key role in accelerating the cost reductions of those technologies. A key component of reducing the costs of new technologies is not only through learning and economies of scale but it is also by reducing investors&rsquo; perception of political risk.</p> <p>The Crown Estate found, for example, last year that for each 1% reduction in the costs of borrowing &ndash; a metric that is highly dependent on perception of risks &ndash; the costs of offshore wind were likely to go down by around 6%. So, stable policies that create a clear demand for low-carbon power in the long-term and provide stable financial support make sense in that they will have an important bearing in reducing risks for investors and, therefore, technological costs.</p> <p>When you also take into account the forecasts of organisations like the International Energy Agency that indicate that gas prices and gas imports are likely to continue rising in the EU over the next 20 years, with or without shale gas, the CCC have put a compelling case that moving early towards a low-carbon power sector makes strong economic and environmental sense.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519df645e4b0371c681f9fed\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T11:58:47.173+01:00\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever, <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org\">Carbon Brief</a> is quick off the mark with <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/05/climate-change-committee-report-on-emr\">its analysis</a>. Robin Webster makes some crucial points and observations, so here's a fulsome extract, which includes a quote given to Carbon Brief by David Kennedy, the CCC's chief executive:</p> <blockquote> <p>The CCC is scathing about the government's <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65654/7165-gas-generation-strategy.pdf\"> gas strategy</a>, launched last December. The gas strategy suggested three possible futures for UK energy policy - including a 'dash for gas' scenario where significantly more gas generation would be built. Publishing \"such widely varying scenarios for sector development\" has created confusion amongst investors, the committee says.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are some similarities between the gas strategy and the CCC's modelling. Both documents suggests that the country could reduce the power sector's emissions intensity to 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030 - and still hit its emissions targets.&nbsp;</p> <p>But in the CCC's report, this outcome is very much \"Plan B\". It accepts that energy policy is very uncertain and it is hard to make meaningful predictions. For example, nuclear power could <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/03/how-on-earth-will-we-pay-for-new-nuclear\">turn out to cost more</a> than the government expects; <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/04/policymakers-ccs-delays-could-cost-the-uk-%C2%A340-billion-a-year\"> carbon capture and storage</a> technology might not deliver; or <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/02/cost-of-offshore-wind\">offshore wind</a> might turn out to be more expensive than hoped.&nbsp;</p> <p>In these cases, the country might fail to meet the 50g target, and emissions intensity might be reduced to 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030. But crucially, under the CCC's assumptions, the less mature low carbon technologies would still have been developed. The country would have a wide diversity of low-carbon technologies to rely on, not just gas and nuclear:</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-76845714-f90d-4106-a038-d154c4f2df8b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369306464966/d72c406b-e3a1-43f7-8137-18cc6a7eccf3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 1.7a: 2030 scenarios under less favourable conditions - generation (TWh/yr)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Figure 1.7a: 2030 scenarios under less favourable conditions - generation (TWh/yr) Photograph: CCC/Redpoint/CCC calculations</figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The CCC contrasts the government's approach with its own, saying:</p> <p>\"...a scenario with high nuclear deployment, but low investment in CCS and offshore wind during the 2020s (e.g. as assumed in the government's emissions projections) could deliver a similar emissions intensity but would leave the UK overly reliant on a single low-carbon technology. This would imply unacceptable costs and risks of achieving the 2050 target and/or of very high electricity prices required to deploy uncommercialised low-carbon options at scale after 2030.\"</p> <p>As our teachers used to say: to fail to prepare is to prepare to fail.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that the report is based on a crucial assumption - that the UK government and governments worldwide will be committed to decarbonising in the future. Indeed, the CCC's prediction of savings in the UK is based on there being an effective carbon price.</p> <p>And in the UK, cutting emissions and reforming the electricity market continues to present a challenge to politicians focused on short-term energy bills, especially as the savings the CCC predicts depend on high renewable rollout - which will cost money.</p> <p>In fact, in the short term, the CCC estimates that subsidies for low-carbon technologies will add &pound;100 to consumer energy bills by 2020. The greatest economic benefits from investing in low carbon would come after 2030 - which, when the next election is in just two years, is a long time in politics.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chief executive of the CCC, David Kennedy, gave Carbon Brief his opinion:&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Some people might say this is about the 2030s and 40's, so who cares? But lot of us hope to alive then, and so will our kids our grandkids. It's the same argument as about national debt or pensions. Energy is the same, you have to think long term.

This extension of the time frame beyond 2020 will encourage the necessary investment at a very limited additional cost to the consumer, adding &pound;20 to the annual household energy bill in 2030 compared to 2020, while offering significant cost savings thereafter.<br />This conclusion has been reached after considering whether an alternative strategy of investing in gas-fired generation through the 2020s and delaying investment in low-carbon technologies to the 2030s would be more sensible. The detailed analysis shows that to invest in low-carbon technologies to 2020, then to focus on investment in gas in the 2020s, and to move back to investment in low-carbon generation in the 2030s simply doesn&rsquo;t stand up. Such an approach is likely to drive up costs, by up to &pound;100 billion in some scenarios.<br />It is therefore important to avoid these unnecessary costs by resolving present uncertainties. The government should state clearly that it intends to support investments in low-carbon technologies through the 2020s. We think that the best way to do this is to set in legislation this parliament a target to reduce 2030 carbon intensity to 50 gCO2/kWh. Industry has been clear that this would provide them with the confidence that they need to invest large amounts of money in project development and the supply chain.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519dec82e4b0371c681f9fe2\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T11:16:34.932+01:00\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a summary of the reaction to today's CCC report...</p> <p><strong>Ed Davey, the energy secretary, in the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/switch-to-lowcarbon-future-would-save-households-1600-8628138.html\">Independent</a></strong>: &ldquo;In the long term, low-carbon could be a much cheaper path to go. Our opponents don&rsquo;t want to admit that we really do care about people&rsquo;s bills, but actually I&rsquo;m the consumer&rsquo;s champion here. The real reason for high energy bills is high global gas prices. I can&rsquo;t control global gas prices but I can put a cushion between the high global gas price that people face and the bills consumers pay,&rdquo; in part by supporting low-carbon power generation, he added.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change\">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> spokesman</strong>: We agree with the CCC on both the need to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies, and the need to reduce our dependence on imported gas which is the main factor driving up household energy bills. We recently trebled government support for low-carbon technologies to &pound;7.6bn out to 2020, and we have introduced landmark legislation through the energy bill to incentivise &pound;110bn of investment in clean energy infrastructure, which has the potential to support 250,000 jobs in the energy sector. This July, we will set out the strike prices we will offer investors within our electricity market reform delivery plan, and prior to this will consult with a range of interested parties, as well as considering the CCC&rsquo;s recommendations.</p> <p><strong><strong>Tim Yeo MP</strong>, chair of the Commons' <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/ecc\">Energy and Climate Change Committee</a></strong>: This report raises serious concerns about the mixed messages the government has been sending on energy and climate change policy. The energy bill is supposed to deliver billions of pounds of investment in clean energy infrastructure by providing long term certainty and reducing capital costs, but the Treasury has undermined investor confidence by stripping the legislation of a clear carbon reduction target. If the government wants to secure the maximum economic benefits of its energy bill, it must listen to the advice of its own independent advisors and introduce a target to clean up the power sector by 2030. The decarbonisation amendment I have tabled on the energy bill will do just that. Unfortunately, the government seems prepared to gamble on gas prices going down instead. If fossil fuel prices were to rise due to growing global energy demand and when an inevitable international deal is struck to avoid the worst effects of climate change, this might may make gas even more expensive.</p> <p><strong>Nick Molho, head of energy and climate change policy at <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/press_centre/?uNewsID=6604\">WWF-UK</a></strong>: Like quitting smoking now for the benefit of your long-term health, this report shows that shifting early to a low-carbon power sector is a no-regrets policy. It's technically feasible, should deliver big savings to people's energy bills and create promising growth opportunities in areas like offshore wind where the UK is an industrial leader. In a world in which we&rsquo;re serious about preventing dangerous levels of climate change, this report is also clear that gas can only have a limited role to play. If we want to unlock the many benefits of low-carbon investment, the energy bill needs to give investors confidence that the UK is the place to invest. Stable financial support and a long-term decarbonisation target will be key to giving businesses the clarity they need.</p> <p><strong>Leila Deen, a <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a> energy campaigner</strong>: Every MP in British politics should take heed of this report, because in two weeks&rsquo; time they&rsquo;ll be making the biggest changes to the UK&rsquo;s energy system in a generation when they vote on the energy bill. The CCC&rsquo;s advice is clear - a clean energy system is better for business and better for consumers. George Osborne has ripped a 2030 decarbonisation target from the bill, but with hundreds of businesses and investors crying foul, it&rsquo;s up to Coalition MPs to vote it back in. Only that way can we ensure the UK is on a path to cleaner, safer, cheaper power.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519de081e4b0371c681f9fd2\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T10:26:17.730+01:00\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a>, which advises the UK government on meeting its emissions targets, has today <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/next-steps-on-electricity-market-reform-23-may-2013/\">published a report</a> outlining why investing in low-carbon technologies will, over the longer term, be more cost effective than gas.</p> <p>As Fiona Harvey in the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/23/renewable-energy-committee-climate-change\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The sooner the UK makes large investments in low-carbon generation &ndash; including offshore and onshore wind, nuclear power and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy\">energy</a> from waste &ndash; the cheaper it will be, according to David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC).</p> <p>The conclusions are likely to be controversial, as many MPs on the right of the Tory party have been clamouring for an end to onshore windfarms and reductions in renewable subsidies.</p> <p>They would prefer to see a new \"dash for gas\" that would require the UK to massively expand shale gas drilling and import tens of billions of pounds worth of fuel each year as North Sea reserves run down. They point to lower gas prices in the US that have resulted from the aggressive pursuit of shale resources.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report is published just a couple of weeks before MPs vote on the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/energy.html\">energy bill</a>, which will help to determine the UK's energy strategy in the years and decades ahead. The CCC's report is rare in that it looks out to far beyond 2030 in its forecasting, arguing that investment now in low-carbon energy will pay dividends by the next decade and beyond, unlike gas which suffers - and will continue to suffer - from unpredictable price volatility.</p> <p>Do the sums add up for low-carbon technologies? Can we really know what prices are likely to be decades ahead? Is paying more now for low-carbon energy a sound investment over the longer term, compared to making a \"dash for gas\"?</p> <p>Please leave your own thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too.

He's not impressed...</p><blockquote><p>So that's it then. The final shred of credibility of \"the greenest government ever\" has been doused in petrol and ignited with a casual flick of a gold-plated lighter. The appointment of Owen Paterson as environment secretary is a declaration of war on the environment, and another sign that the right of the party – fiercely opposed to anything that prevents business from doing as it wishes – has won.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.03pm:</span> Dr Mike Clarke, the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/\">RSPB</a>'s chief executive, has sent me this reaction:</p><blockquote><p>With the cabinet reshuffle predicated on the government's desire to boost the economy, we trust the new environment secretary Owen Paterson will be a strong champion of wildlife and the natural environment. Over the past two years the public has, through debates about forestry, planning, badgers and buzzards shown how they much care about the natural world. The challenge for the new secretary of state is to build on this public support to find ways to realise the ambitions in the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/natural/whitepaper/\">natural environment white paper</a>.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.11pm:</span> James Cooper, the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk\">Woodland Trust</a>'s head of government affairs, has <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.presscentre.com/News-Releases/Woodland-Trust-comment-on-Owen-Paterson-s-appointment-as-Secretary-of-State-for-Environment-Food-and-Rural-Affairs-c16.aspx\">posted this reaction online</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Owen Paterson comes with strong rural credentials which should mean he will become rapidly up to speed with the issues. He has shown a willingness to be outspoken in the past on a range of issues and we hope this translates into a robust championing of the natural environment against often ill-considered calls from elsewhere for relaxation of protections. Paterson lists trees among his interests and, naturally, we welcome that. One of the most important issues in his in-tray is the government response to the Independent Panel on Forestry's report on the future of England's forests. The report, published in July, offered a clear sense of direction widely supported across the sector and included the crucial recommendation to increase woodland cover to 15% by 2060. The ball is now very much in government's court and it needs to match the leadership provided by the panel. This provides an excellent early opportunity for Owen Paterson to be bold. By doing so, he can show he understands the potential of the natural environment to provide value for money by delivering across several agendas simultaneously.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.41pm:</span> Here are the thoughts of Jennifer Webber, director of external affairs at <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/\">RenewableUK</a>, the trade body for the wind and marine energy industries, to the news that John Hayes has replaced Charles Hendry at Decc:</p><blockquote><p>Mr Hayes brings a wealth of experience from his previous role as Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning. We know that he already appreciates the importance of providing the right training for the skilled workforce of the future. Tens of thousands of those workers will be in the green energy sector, so Mr Hayes' experience at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will serve him in good stead as Energy Minister, and we look forward to working with him.<br />His predecessor Charles Hendry made an outstanding contribution to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. He was instrumental in the setting up of the Offshore Wind Cost Reduction Task Force, which published a key report in June showing how the cost of offshore wind can be driven down by more than 30% in the next seven years.<br />Mr Hendry also played a key role in the particularly challenging task of drafting the Energy Bill. He worked closely on the intricate details of this key piece of legislation which will determine the financial support framework for the energy industry for years to come. His successor will need to acquaint himself with this brief as swiftly as possible, as Electricity Market Reform must proceed without delay, so that future investment in wind and marine energy is not put at risk. RenewableUK will be engaging with Mr Hayes and his team to ensure that he fully understands the perspective of the wind and marine energy industries on these crucial issues.</p></blockquote><p>For background, it is worth noting that John Hayes has been critical of wind power in his Norfolk constituency. Here's <a href=\"http://81.29.73.156/~eeegrdev99/news/info.php?refnum=702&amp;startnum=1746.5\">an article from 2004</a> in which he hits out at \"highly questionable guidance\" of the wind \"trade lobby\". And <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2005-07-07a.141.1&amp;s=wind+speaker:10265#g156.1\">here's a speech</a> he gave in the Commons in 2005:</p><blockquote><p>Can we, for heaven's sake, consider the relative impact that the imposition of turbines has on the surrounding environment?...We must invest in renewables, but not in a way that is damaging to the quality of life and the local environment of the people who have those industrial structures close by.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.57pm:</span> There appears to be some confusion over whether Owen Paterson is a climate sceptic or not. I can't yet find anything on the record in which he has stated his position on this topic. Both the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520174/Owen-Paterson-becomes-new-Environment-Secretary.html\">Telegraph</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ruthless-david-cameron-shuffles-to-the-right-8105058.html\">Independent</a> are describing him as a climate sceptic, but this appears to stem from remarks made by Lord Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/22/chris-huhne-lawson-think-tank\">prominent climate sceptic</a>, during an interview on Sky News yesterday lunchtime. I asked Lawson this morning to clarify what he said in response to this question from <a href=\"http://blogs.news.sky.com/profile/Adam%20Boulton\">Sky's Adam Boulton</a>: \"Do you like Paterson because he's a bit of a climate change sceptic like you?\"</p><p>Lawson told me:</p><blockquote><p>When Boulton asked the question what I in fact replied was \"He is a man of reason and common sense\".</p></blockquote><p>There had been reports that he had responded in the affirmative with: \"Yes, he is a man of reason and common sense.\" It would appear, then, that we will need to wait until Paterson is himself asked the direct question.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.01pm:</span> Here are the thoughts of Joss Garman from <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Support for clean energy and action on climate change sits firmly in the centre ground of our country's politics, and our politicians know it. If these new ministers start sacrificing our much loved countryside and reject opportunities in new green industries in favour of fracking rigs, roads and runways, they surely know they will pay a political price.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.05pm:</span> Here's the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geoffreylean/100179301/reshuffle-environment-from-the-nurse-to-the-lion/\">analysis of Geoffrey Lean</a>, the veteran environmental correspondent now with the Telegraph:</p><blockquote><p>All this suggests a lively time ahead. Green groups might even be quietly looking forward to it, since they thrive -and add membership and income – when in conflict with government (and have often languished when, as over the decade or so, governments have largely agreed with them). But it may well lead to increased strains within the coalition, as the Liberal Democrats increasingly, if belatedly, look to green issues as a key way of differentiating themselves from the Tories, – and, in particular with energy secretary Ed Davey, a rising star, who has the greenest background of any member of the Cabinet. And it may make it even more difficult for the Prime Minister to say he has fulfilled his pledge of leading \"the greenest government ever\".</p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.12pm:</span> The Scottish National Party is, predictably, <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2012/sep/reshuffle-shows-true-tory-colours-green-issues\">unimpressed</a>. Mike Weir, its energy and climate change spokesperson, said:</p><blockquote><p>This reshuffle removes any last hint of green from the true blue Tory cabinet. The days when David Cameron promised the 'greenest government ever' are now a distant memory. The appointment of an environment secretary who is against wind farms and energy subsidies will be a cause for concern for the vital renewables industry.<br />Renewables is not just about tackling climate change – it's about attracting investment and creating jobs. The renewables industry now meets 35 per cent of Scotland's annual demand for electricity and directly employs more than 11,000 people across the country. The UK government has already created uncertainty over funding for onshore wind, and remains wedded to the discredited and expensive nuclear power industry. Regressive measures from an increasingly right-wing Tory led government must not be allowed to hinder the continued growth of this vital industry.<br />This reshuffle shows the UK government has its priorities all wrong. Instead of pandering to the right of their party, they should be supporting the Scottish government's efforts to invest in a clean, green energy future. Instead of debating a third runway at congested Heathrow, they should be encouraging a modal shift from plane to train by committing to high speed rail to Scotland, not Birmingham.\"<br />The UK government reshuffle shows Cameron's attempt at a green rinse has worn off and their true Tory colours are coming through.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.45pm:</span> David Norman, <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF</a>'s director of campaigns, has sent me this reaction:</p><blockquote><p>The coalition needs to avoid own-goals that could undermine its claim to be the 'greenest government ever'. WWF enthusiastically applauded early decisions such as ruling out a third runway at Heathrow and establishing a green investment bank, which ministers are rightly proud of. However, the reshuffle has done little to defuse speculation over a possible government U-turn on airport capacity. Ministers should make clear that this was a principled and evidence-based decision that will stand, not one that might be cast aside at the next manifesto-writing opportunity.<br />There are big challenges ahead, notably around electricity market reform and support for the green economy. The green investment bank needs to be properly capitalised and allowed to borrow to be truly effective. A recent <a href=\"http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea_p.aspx?id=6629\">Green Alliance report</a> said that whilst the general economy will only return to 2007 levels by 2014 at the earliest, the green economy will have grown by 40% in that same period. New and existing ministers need to unequivocally back the green economy and challenge the view that there is any dichotomy between green and growth. Electricity market reform is likewise a critical test of whether the government can provide the policy certainly that investors need to deliver a secure, decarbonised energy sector cost-effectively.<br />The true impact of the reshuffle will be felt when new ministers are in post and engaged with their briefs, and it is perhaps too early to say what effects the changes will have on the government's green credentials. However, when as powerful a voice as the <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/\">CBI</a> is arguing that the \"so-called \"choice\" between going green or going for growth is a false one\", and that policy certainty is urgently needed, the government needs to listen closely.\" </p></blockquote><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.51pm:</span> Benny Peiser, director of the <a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.org/\">Global Warming Policy Foundation</a>, Lord Lawson's climate sceptic thinktank, has a <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/forum/britain-can-finally-make-the-dash-gas-paterson\">piece in today's City AM</a> welcoming Owen Paterson's appointment as the new environment secretary:</p><blockquote><p>In the past, Paterson has proposed an end to all energy subsidies and a speedy development of domestic shale gas reserves. His endorsement of shale exploration is particularly pertinent, since DEFRA is responsible for the Environment Agency, which is in charge of regulating and policing shale gas ventures.<br />Most crucially, the government intends to publish a new Economy Bill in the next few days, detailing a major deregulation of the planning system. Paterson will be responsible for the deregulation of environmental assessments, allowing fast-tracked developments.<br />In light of Britain's struggling economy, it is becoming increasingly evident that the passion for green control and command policies is coming to its predictable end. Saving jobs and the economy is now the uppermost priority for Britain and most other European countries.<br />Restricting shale gas is not saving the planet and it's impoverishing Britain's families and companies. Paterson must act fast.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.03pm:</span> Andrew Pendleton, Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, says elements of the reshuffle are \"worrying\": </p><blockquote><p>The government's pledge to be the greenest ever has been considerably undermined by many of the actions and policies it has introduced since coming to power. And with a chancellor who appears to see the environment as a barrier to growth and decisions to be made on energy, aviation, housing and planning, the next few months will be significant not just for this government's eco-credentials, but for the long-term well-being of future generations and the environment.<br />The reshuffle is significant - and the removal of Justine Greening who is opposed to expansion at Heathrow is worrying - and we certainly hope that the new ministerial teams will stand up for the environment. But the most crucial element is whether David Cameron and senior Liberal Democrats are willing and able to reign in the chancellor.<br />The green economy is one area that is experiencing growth - at around four per cent a year. But George Osborne appears to be extremely reluctant to back this thriving sector. The chancellor has even been criticised by the CBI over his lack of support for green business and his failure to recognise the key role it could play in reviving the economy.<br />Until the government wakes up to the fact that a strong economy and environmental protection are two sides of the same coin, its pledge to be the greenest ever will fail.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.12pm:</span> During prime minister's questions earlier in the Commons, David Cameron indicated that a consultation on the expansion of Heathrow will be announced soon. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19484126\">BBC reported</a> him saying:</p><blockquote><p>\"These very large infrastructure projects are extremely difficult for individual governments to take and to deliver. What we need to do is build a process that hopefully has cross-party support so we can look carefully at this issue and deliver changes that will address the problems of capacity we will have in future years and address the issue of the hub status in the UK. I am hoping to make an announcement on this over the coming days...but this won't happen unless parties sign up to a process that can deliver.\"<br />Asked by Labour MP John McDonnell whether he would rule out sanctioning a new runway while he was prime minister, Mr Cameron said he would \"not be breaking my manifesto pledge\".</p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.23pm:</span> Dr Jeremy Biggs, director of <a href=\"http://www.pondconservation.org.uk/\">Pond Conservation</a>: The Water Habitats Trust, has this to say to Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary:</p><blockquote><p>The biggest issue facing our freshwaters is the all pervasive impact of water pollution - and the virtual elimination of unpolluted water from large tracts of the country. This is barely on people's radar as a result of constant PR-led repetition of the mantra 'rivers have never been better' - but these improvements are very modest, and flat-lining. In fact 75% of ponds, rivers and lakes are failing to reach minimum legal standards in England and Wales, and freshwater biodiversity is perilously at risk, mainly because of pollution. The strongest driver for protection comes from European legislation that we are supposed to be implementing - but in an anti-European 'growth-or-bust' agenda there seems only the outside chance that our freshwaters will be in better condition in 10 years time than they are now.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.09pm:</span> Anti-badger cull protesters are seemingly targeting Owen Paterson's office with telephone calls, according to a <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/owen-paterson-cant-make-the-call/\">posting</a> on Stop The Cull's website:</p><blockquote><p>We have already had feedback that the secretary is getting VERY annoyed:<br />\"Not another odd ball are you! What good do you think it does for you and your friends to harass someone with so many important responsibilities? You're making it very difficult for him to do his job.\"</p></blockquote><p>I'm with Paterson's secretary on this. It seems to be a particularly irresponsible way to get your views across.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.11pm:</span> Juliet Davenport, CEO and founder of <a href=\"http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/\">Good Energy</a>, the \"UK's leading 100% renewable electricity supplier\", said:</p><blockquote><p>Charles Hendry earned the respect of many in the renewables industry for taking a balanced and objective approach to defining the coalition's energy policy, putting at its heart the principle that a more renewable future is key to reducing the UK's reliance on the imported fossil fuels that are pushing up people's energy bills. Renewables are the only game in town that can really deliver that, so it's vital that John Hayes picks up where Charles left off and continues that work.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.14pm:</span> Patrick Wintour, the Guardian's political editor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/05/cross-party-heathrow-airport-talks\">has more</a> on the exchanges between Labour's Ed Miliband and David Cameron earlier today at prime minister's questions:</p><blockquote><p>Ed Miliband, when in the Labour government, had led opposition to a third runway, but was overruled by Gordon Brown.<br />All parties are trying to balance the needs of the UK economy, Britain's legally enforceable carbon commitments and the demands of powerful west London voters.<br />At prime minister's questions, Miliband dismissed Tuesday's cabinet reshuffle, saying the top team was \"the same old faces, the same old policies\", adding it was \"a no-change reshuffle\". He added if Cameron really wanted to cut through the dither, there was no place like home.<br />He reeled off statistics to show that previous government pledges to build new roads and social housing had come to nothing. Labour pushed out a dossier claiming major planning decisions are taking longer than under Labour.<br />But the PM hit back, saying the government was \"strong and united\", contrasting coalition unity with the alleged disputes between the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and Miliband.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.23pm:</span> Natalie Bennett, the newly elected leader of the Green Party, has <a href=\"http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2012/09/04/green-party-new-leader,-natalie-bennett,-talks-about-the-cabinet-reshuffle/\">commented on the reshuffle</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There's no sign of a government U-turn towards the investment that we urgently need to create jobs and provide the homes, public transport and sustainable energy infrastructure necessary to meet community needs and build a Britain fit for the low-carbon future...<br />There are also individual moves that are cause for concern. The shifting of Justine Greening out of transport, after only 326 days in the job, makes Patrick McLoughlin Cameron's fifth transport minister, which can be taken as a sign of the government's inability to make sensible policy in this area.<br />It is a bad sign that a third runway at Heathrow is indeed back on the government's agenda, as reports have been suggesting.<br />The aviation industry depends on huge public subsidies. The government seems happy to keep spending public money on increasing CO2 emissions in an industry that's slanted towards serving the wealthy, while making the lives of millions a misery through noise and air pollution.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.44pm:</span> The Evening Standard <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/exclusive-dithering-cameron-puts-off-heathrow-decision-8106543.html\">is reporting</a> that it understands that Sir Howard Davies will head an independent commission to decide Heathrow's future:</p><blockquote><p>The Evening Standard has learned that former business chief Sir Howard Davies will be asked to head the commission and recommend in summer 2015 whether a third runway or a new airport is needed...<br />No 10 would not say who would lead the commission, but the Standard understands that it will be Sir Howard, who was head of the Confederation of British Industry and is a former deputy governor of the Bank of England.<br />Sources predict that if a deal is struck, both main parties are likely to say in their 2015 manifestos that they will assess the recommendations of the Davies panel. A similar formula paved the way for university fees to go up in 2010 without a pre-election row.<br />A transport insider said: \"It will be up to the airlines industry and Boris Johnson to make their case to the commission.\" An interim report may be published before the election, but there will be no decision until afterwards.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 21 --><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395690968\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/5/120905CameronCleggHeathrow-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120905CameronCleggHeathrow/120905CameronCleggHeathrow.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/5/120905CameronCleggHeathrow_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/5/120905CameronCleggHeathrow_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/5/120905CameronCleggHeathrow-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.49pm:</span> Here's the Guardian's video of David Cameron and Nick Clegg responding to questions about Heathrow's future today, in light of the reshuffle:</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.03pm:</span> <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a> has just issued this response to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/05/reshuffle-coalition-greenest-government-ever#block-20\">reports</a> that Sir Howard Davies will head the commission into Heathrow's future:</p><blockquote><p>Responding to news this afternoon that Lord Lawson's former adviser, Sir Howard Davies, is to head the commission looking at expanding Heathrow, John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said:<br />\"David Cameron promised Londoners no ifs, no buts, no third runway at Heathrow, and no U turn on that promise.<br />\"The aviation industry lost the debate on the third runway and, as William Hague said this week, the government could only make this sort of totemic u-turn if the facts had changed, and in this case they haven't.<br />\"Once you consider the noise, pollution, community destruction and climate change impact of new runways, no genuinely independent commission could come to any other conclusion than Hague's.\"<br />\"If Heathrow wants to free up more slots for long haul then it can stop expanding services to Manchester and other cities easily reached by rail.

Paterson was reported in May this year in Conservative Home, a political blog for supporters of the Conservative Party, to be in favor of ending energy subsidies and the fast-track exploitation of shale gas in the UK...<br />Meanwhile, at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), Charles Hendry has been replaced by John Hayes – who has previously campaigned against wind farms in his constituency.<br />Trade body Oil &amp; Gas UK issued a statement Wednesday in which it said that it was looking forward to the continuing commitment of the new ministers in ensuring fit-for-purpose regulation and a business environment that \"promotes investment in the UK's oil and gas resource\".</p></blockquote><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.51pm:</span> Paul King, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.ukgbc.org/\">UK Green Building Council</a>, said:</p><blockquote><p>With Mark Prisk taking over as housing minister in yesterday's reshuffle, it will be interesting to see how he responds to the challenges posed by the chancellor's recent comments about possible further upheaval to the planning regulations.<br />'Hacking back red tape' makes an attractive headline, but in the case of planning policy, it could actually be completely counter-productive. Relaxing planning regulations simply isn't a silver bullet to deliver homes - not least because the availability of finance is clearly a major issue here. It would be sad to see a weakening of our aspirations to develop high-quality, sustainable communities, especially when it's highly unlikely slashing our planning framework even further would actually address the root of the problem.<br />As well as planning-related issues, Prisk will also have to reinvigorate the zero carbon homes policy, after his predecessor Grant Shapps' complete failure to produce a definition for zero carbon or maintain the ambitions of the original policy during his time as Housing Minister.<br />In terms of Owen Paterson's appointment as the new secretary of state for environment, we would hope that given recent figures from the CBI show that around one third of growth over the last year can be attributed to the green economy, Paterson will champion the importance of green growth – not growth at any cost – across Whitehall.<br />It is critical that the government acknowledges the key role a transition to a green economy could play in our recovery from recession.

And I look forward to working with Parliamentary colleagues to put the Coalition's forthcoming Energy Bill into law.\"<br />However, green businesses and NGOs will remain concerned that the appointments of both Hayes and Paterson give Osborne two more allies in influential positions as he pursues his plans to establish the UK as a \"gas hub\", regardless of fears such as strategy will breach the country's carbon targets.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.22pm:</span> </p><h2>My verdict</h2><p> I have never really bought this \"greenest government ever\" line pushed by the current incumbent at Number 10, but this week's reshuffle leaves me even less convinced. It is patently obvious that Cameron's new appointments at Defra and Decc, in particular, are aimed at appeasing the vocal right-wing elements of his party who are ideologically opposed to environmental regulations, as well as anti-free market interventions such as renewable energy subsidies and alike. Add that to their slavish linking of increased airport capacity to economic growth and you have a pretty clear understanding of where much of the Conservative party now stands when it comes to issues such as reducing carbon emissions. Namely, aiding economic growth will always trump any environmental concerns. The presence of the Liberal Democrats has, until now, diluted such sentiments within the coalition, but it would appear that the parties are now already making an effort to mark themselves apart on environmental issues ahead of the next election.</p>","headline":"Can the government still be the 'greenest ever' after the reshuffle?","trailText":"<p>Will the reshuffle impact on the government's green credentials?

The idea that the government - or anyone, for that matter - knows with precision what energy bills will be like in 2020 is hard to entertain. This puts considerable strain on the trustworthiness of the green deal's 'golden rule'.</p> <p>Will the forthcoming advertising blitz by the government, which hopes to highlight the green deal's merits to a much wider audience, actually work? Personally, I think the scheme - despite making sense on paper - goes against many people's instincts when it comes to undertaking expensive home improvements. They want to see results that are upfront and obvious. Being told by an energy advisor - who you've had to pay &pound;100 - that you might save &pound;33 on your bills each year by 2020 is not something that is likely to connect with many people.</p> <p>This is a great shame, as the UK has some of the most energy inefficient housing stock in the developed world. All of these improvements need to be done urgently, not just to reduce energy consumption but to help tackle the rising cost of energy bills.</p> <p>Perhaps I'm absorbing too much of the negative reaction to today's launch? I don't want to be cynical about it: I want to see schemes such as this help householders undertake energy efficiency measures - I will shortly be investigating how the scheme might help me better insulate my own home - but I can't see this scheme being widely adopted in the short-term. It will likely take months, even years, before most people hear of it, let alone seriously consider it. And in the mean time, let's hope the government can address some of the concerns raise by the critics today - not least that the proposed interest rate and terms for the loan don't have much in the way of market appeal.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51069599b579b4cc7f5750b7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, Martin Lewis, the personal finance journalist and broadcaster who founded the hugely successful <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">MoneySavingExpert</a> website, has just tweeted...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MartinSLewis/status/295911255942782977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>On the Green Deal we're doing full analysis similar to my student fee mythbusting guide (as its VERY similar) published (i hope) a week Wed</p>&mdash; Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinSLewis/status/295911255942782977\">January 28, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The MoneySavingExpert website is also hosting a <a href=\"http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?p=58944451#post58944451\">green deal forum</a> for its readers to discuss the scheme.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-510694d6b579b4cc7f5750b6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greg Barker uses a not-so-eco metaphor to thank his staff &hellip;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregBarkerMP/status/295911265581285377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>As the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23GreenDeal\">#GreenDeal</a> springs into life, a huge THANK YOU to my really terrific team at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23DECC\">#DECC</a> who have worked so hard to get it off the runway!</p>&mdash; Greg Barker (@GregBarkerMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregBarkerMP/status/295911265581285377\">January 28, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51069451b579b4cc7f5750b5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/author/isabel-hardman/\">Isabel Hardman</a> on the Spectator's <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/01/grey-launch-day-for-green-deal/\">Coffee House blog</a> notes the omission of Marks &amp; Spencer from the scheme:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Green Deal isn&rsquo;t quite the big all-singing all-dancing deal the government envisaged.

Rates will be comparable to the best high street rates for long-term unsecured loans. But whilst these are accessible to barely half the population, TGDFC will lend to over 80%.</p> <p>Green deal providers will determine their own all-in package to consumers. However, on the basis of the finance agreements being put in place, TGDFC are now publishing the interest rate and charges for finance to green deal providers. TGDFC's initial interest rate will be 6.96% per annum. Each green deal plan will have a set up charge of &pound;63 and annual operating charge of &pound;20 payable by providers who may choose to add this to the overall cost of finance to the household, depending on the size and length of the green deal plan.</p> <p>Because of the fixed costs of setting up and administering these loans, the more energy efficiency measures a household takes out over the lifetime of the product, the cheaper the all-in annual cost. So, if providers pass on all charges, someone doing the basics for &pound;1,500 (on a 25 year deal) would pay a maximum all-in cost of 9.34%. But if that person takes out the full package of measures suitable for them, including solid wall insulation, loft insulation and other improvements totalling &pound;5,000, they would only pay 7.67% &ndash; all funded by the expected savings on energy bills</p> <p>The most effective large scale, energy efficiency measures such cavity or solid wall insulation, can be financed over 10-25 years at interest rates of 7.96% to 7.67%. The \"golden rule\" is designed to ensure that expected savings on bills should be at least as big as the total repayments, including any interest rate.

Here's Neil Schofield, head of external and governmental affairs at <a href=\"http://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/homeowner\">Worcester, Bosch Group</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What homeowners need to wake up and realise is, they are throwing money away by running inefficient boilers and poorly insulated homes. A boiler, which is commonly seen as a distress purchase, should now be viewed as a long-term, cost-effective solution for rising energy prices. With news that fuel bills will double by the end of the decade, there has never been a better time to take steps to ensure our homes are as energy efficient as possible.</p> <p>We believe this latest announcement is extremely reassuring for householders. Not only does it emphasise the importance the government has placed on the issue of increasing the efficiency of the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;4.5m band G gas-fired boilers, it also offers a solution to help homeowners save money on the ever-rising energy bills.</p> <p>For the boiler industry alone approximately 5,000 installations take place on a daily basis, so the opportunity for the industry to enhance the collective heating efficiency of UK homes is clear to see. The green deal is the &lsquo;main show in town&rsquo; and we believe this new initiative will make a real impact,&nbsp;by both significantly reducing carbon emissions and securing affordable long term energy prices for homeowners.</p> <p>From today, households in England and Wales will be able to complete 45 different types of improvements currently available under the green deal, helping consumers warm up their homes and pay for some or all of the improvements over time through their electricity bill.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5106882bb579b4cc7f5750ad\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Economist has a <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/01/green-deal\">blog post by \"A.B.\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Moves to transform the energy efficiency of Britain&rsquo;s housing stock are worth applauding, but some aspects of the green deal will leave potential customers feeling a little queasy. Some will wonder whether in the current climate the government should be encouraging its electors to take on debt, even for environmentally beneficial ends. And it is unclear what effect the deal will have on the property market: some would-be buyers will not want to purchase properties burdened with large loans.</p> <p>The fact that the &pound;100-or-so cost of the assessors&rsquo; services will in many cases have to be paid up front will also put customers off. The government hopes to incentivise people to join the green deal by offering early participants money back. It has put &pound;125m into a cashback scheme, which is available on a first-come-first-served basis. The first &pound;40m of that will be given out per energy-efficiency measure according to a sliding scale (&pound;250 for cavity wall insulation, for example, and &pound;50 for draught-proofing). After that the rates are likely to reduce. Perhaps, as suggested by Labour&rsquo;s Alan Whitehead in his <a href=\"http://alansenergyblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/cashfront-vs-cashback-a-modest-proposal/\">blog</a>, the money could be more wisely diverted towards funding the assessments.</p> <p>And finally, the punitive interest rates will ensure that a lot of useful household improvement works simply will not qualify under the golden rule. When he was secretary of state for energy and climate change, Chris Huhne called the green deal \"the most ambitious energy-saving plan ever put forward&rdquo;. As it lurches into action this week, he may be relieved to be no longer involved.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51067bf0b579b4cc7f5750a5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of it duplicates what's already been said here, but Carbon Brief has produced a green deal \"<a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/01/green-deal-news-roundup\">news roundup</a>\".</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5106747795cb80127a45244e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Guardian Money's Rupert Jones has put together a \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/jan/28/green-deal-home-improvement\">handy guide</a> [that] will help you decide whether the government's energy-saving initiative is right for your household\".</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51066fe395cb80127a45244b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sorry, another cheesy video for you.

Hundreds of&nbsp;green deal participants are already registered and ready to go and many more businesses will be keen to become involved. Public awareness of the scheme is currently low but the&nbsp;green deal has been exempted from the Government marketing freeze and a campaign to raise its profile is imminent. Coupled with this, the Government has committed to spend &pound;125 million cash back on a first come first saved basis to incentivise early adopters.</p> <p>Another significant factor that will drive take-up of the&nbsp;green deal is the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). Under ECO the big six energy companies are to make an estimated &pound;1.3 billion a year available to subsidise energy efficiency measures for low income households and hard-to-treat properties. The ECO will work alongside the green deal. In addition to individuals, local authorities and social housing providers will be particularly keen to take advantage of the new subsidy to improve the energy efficiency of their housing stock.</p> <p>There is no denying that the&nbsp;green deal presents opportunities across the board for businesses, householders, landlords and the public sector.</p> <p><strong>Toby Darbyshire, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.engensa.com/\">Engensa</a>, the \"UK&rsquo;s fastest-growing provider of residential solar systems\":</strong> Engensa believes that the green deal has failed the public and the energy efficiency in a series of respects including</p> <p>&nbsp;1. Complex application and administration process. Bureaucracy adds needless extra time and cost not encountered with existing private contracts</p> <p>2. Loan period of 25 years. Engensa&rsquo;s experience is that that consumers don&rsquo;t want such long repayment periods.</p> <p>3. Inflated interest rate of 9.26%. This is significantly higher than that already available in the marketplace and without the onerous conditions of the green deal</p> <p>4. Restricted installer list. The consumer may not be able to choose the supplier that is right for them</p> <p>5. Loan is held by property and repayments tied to a named power supplier. As the loan is not held by the individual alone Engensa believes this increases difficulty in selling properties and so will slow the housing market further.</p> <p>6. The green deal makes no explicit provision for encouraging energy saving efforts by landlords in the booming by-to-let private rented sector and so fails to encourage energy efficiency in a growing area. As the loan is held by property and repayments tied to a named power this further discourages landlords form investing under the scheme.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5106667795cb80127a452443\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reader reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever, thanks for the comments below.

The only way it will appeal is if the repayments plus normal fuel usage add up to less than what they are currently paying on their fuel bills. I also understand that certain providers may levy an early repayment charge. But why wouldn't you want to try &amp; pay it off early and therefore benefit from the lower bills?

Worse still, the loan is attached to the property so it is likely that when it comes to selling the property most buyers will demand the price be reduced by the cost of the loan.</p> <p>Green deal throws up other hurdles: householders must pay a &pound;100 plus for a survey: that's a hefty surcharge to install a boiler. There is the &pound;125m government giveaway in the form of cashbacks, such as &pound;270 for a boiler and &pound;650 for solid wall insulation and those installers and merchants quick of the mark may benefit. But &pound;125m is small beer against what is needed to stimulate the housing refurbishment market.</p> <p>For merchants, the major downside is the way the green deal concentrates the supply of materials and installations in the hands of a few large providers that deny the end-buyer influence over what is installed and by whom.</p> <p>As it stands, builders' merchants and others in the industry are unlikely to see much of lift in sales following the green deal.

Here are the researchers' key findings:</p> <blockquote> <p>* The biggest motivating factor in the decision to renovate is to improve domestic life, with households facing competing priorities and those needing to extend or adapt space at home, being more likely to consider renovations.<br />* Up to a third of decisions to renovate are triggered by specific events &ndash; the most common being when something in the home needs fixing or replacing &ndash; such as a boiler or window.<br />* For homeowners planning to renovate, the green deal is an attractive option. Homeowners planning to spend &pound;5,000 on insulation and a boiler upgrade are more than twice as likely to consider using the green deal than not.<br />* A strong and focused &lsquo;value proposition&rsquo; is essential to support renovators. Contractor reliability, and avoiding hassle and disruption to domestic life, are the most important factors. Making it easy to find out and decide about renovating is relevant in some cases, as are warranties, but less so.<br />*&nbsp;Importantly, the&nbsp;green deal may also be used to expand the scope of homeowners&rsquo; renovations plans.

Here's a roundup ...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow climate change minister, on the news that the basic rate of interest on any loan will be at least 6.96%, but could be as high as 9.34%: </strong>This is extremely disappointing news. The whole point of the green deal is that households are meant to save money on their energy bills &ndash; but with rip-off interest rates, hidden charges and penalty payments the green deal will end up costing people more than they save. With sky high interest rates like these it&rsquo;s hard to see how the&nbsp;green deal will be anything other than a bad deal for the public.</p> <p><strong>Paul Davies, partner at <a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/\">PwC</a>:</strong> It's easy to get distracted by the headlines or expect too much too soon. The reality is this has the potential to be a truly transformational programme, kick starting a much needed upgrade of Britain's housing stock, and help the economy on the way. It could also make one of the most significant contributions to our 2020 carbon reduction commitments.</p> <p>As this is a long-term approach, I wouldn't expect everyone to come flocking to the idea straight away. Many people will still wait until they can fit it around other home improvements or moving house.</p> <p>Rising energy prices means fuel bills are only going in one direction. Keeping our energy bills affordable means we need to tackle energy efficiency on a large scale, for the long term. The green deal allows households to install these measures with no upfront cost. The Green Deal Finance Company's lending policy has also made this affordable, and accessible to over 80% of the population.</p> <p>With&nbsp;green deal repayments linked to your home, not you personally, we could find that as adoption builds, people's expectations of lower carbon, higher energy efficiency being built into the bricks and mortar of a home will be changed, whether your home is big or small, and built last year, or last century.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong><strong>Richard Lloyd</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>executive director</strong> at <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/\">Which?</a>: </strong>Rising energy prices are one of consumers&rsquo; top financial concerns so we support measures to make homes more energy efficient and save people money on their bills but we want to make sure consumers are aware of all the pros and cons before taking out financing through the green deal. The&nbsp;green deal might work for some people but, as with any financial product, whether it&rsquo;s a good deal for you will depend upon your personal and financial circumstances. Overall, people should tread carefully, check the small print and shop around.</p> <p>[Which? has also put together this <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/energy/creating-an-energy-saving-home/guides/the-green-deal-explained/what-is-the-green-deal/\">detailed guide on the green deal</a>.]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/james-blog/2238903/the-green-deal-is-a-good-deal-but-it-could-have-been-a-great-deal\">James Murray</a>, editor of Business Green:</strong> For all its imperfections, the&nbsp;green deal remains one of the most important and potentially transformative environmental programmes introduced by the coalition government.</p> <p>Ministers were right to realise the only way to deliver a national scale upgrade of our appallingly inefficient building stock is to switch from a grant scheme that could never be sufficiently scaled to a financing model that still promises to deliver households and businesses net savings.</p> <p>The rates of interest may be higher than people would have liked, but for some households and small businesses they will still represent a good deal, particularly when the government's initial cashback offer is taken into account.</p> <p><strong>Ed Matthew, head of the <a href=\"http://www.energybillrevolution.org/\">Energy Bill Revolution</a>, the fuel poverty campaign:</strong> The government&rsquo;s flagship energy efficiency policies, the&nbsp;green deal and energy company obligation, will not stop fuel poverty rocketing in the face of high gas prices. The prime minister must get a grip on this growing crisis, and take a much more ambitious approach to tacking fuel poverty. We call on him to use money from the carbon tax to super-insulate this country&rsquo;s homes. This will provide households with five times more subsidy to insulate their homes and not add a penny more to energy bills. It is enough to eliminate fuel poverty and in time cut bills for everyone. It is the just and fair solution.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/27/green-deal-benefits-tory-friends\">John Vidal</a>, the Guardian's environment editor:</strong> I don't trust it. It smacks of the worst kind of market economics. The words \"green\" and \"deal\" have been so cynically abused by government, business and financiers in the last 10 years that I can only think it's another clever instrument dreamed up by the Tories to profit City financiers and their chums in the giant energy companies &ndash; the three groups who have fleeced us rotten with their austerity measures, mis-selling and profiteering.</p> <p>The financial side scares me; but the hidden agenda may be worse. It appears to be to help the corporates take over what used to be known as home improvements. Behind the cosy language of reducing bills, keeping granny warm and helping the poor a massive bureaucracy has been erected, whose effect will be to keep out ordinary tradesman, co-ops and small renewable-energy companies. We are told this is to protect homeowners from sharks and cowboy builders, but it seems designed to ensure only large installation and energy companies profit from the anticipated market.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/01/appraising-the-green-deal\">Robin Webster </a>at Carbon Brief:</strong> Getting the&nbsp;green deal up and running is clearly an epic task. The complications around financing the scheme, and the challenge of upgrading the UK's leaky housing stock are intimidating.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ministers talk confidently of a programme that is going to run in the long-term, providing businesses with the certainty they need to spend money training staff. The media, meanwhile, appear to be on the lookout for holes in the scheme.</p> <p>Any such faults could have a big impact on consumer energy bills. As DECC's <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/policy-impacts-on-prices-and-bills\">website outlines</a>, the department projects that its energy efficiency policies will bring down consumer bills relative to what they would have been if the measures weren't in place.</p> <p>But that depends on the&nbsp;green deal being a success. For the government, the&nbsp;green deal is a crucial part of the argument that policies will protect consumers from energy bill price hikes. But no take-up would mean no limiting effect on energy bills. We'll wait and see.</p> <p><strong>Angela Knight, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/\">Energy UK</a>:</strong> Energy UK fully supports the&nbsp;green deal and we as an industry will help the government and providers of the&nbsp;green deal in making it a success. It is very welcome that customers are now being reached and being encouraged to make their homes warmer by taking out green deals. Over the long term, this programme will help customers both upgrade their home and manage their energy consumption.</p> <p>Energy UK believes that the key to the success of the green deal will be customer engagement and that is why we are supporting government by holding regional roadshows this year promoting energy efficiency measures. We are also gearing up for a major programme of help for difficult to treat homes and customers who are particularly vulnerable; the energy company obligation.</p> <p><strong>Alan Milstein, chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.rpsa.org.uk/\">Residential Property Surveyors Association</a>:</strong> For many consumers, taking on a green deal loan may not be the most cost effective mechanism to fund any green improvements to their property and it will be important that consumers can access advice on the full range of financing mechanisms available to them. With early repayment penalties and the uncertainty surrounding how having a&nbsp;green deal loan attached to your property will impact on the future saleability of the property, for many homeowners it may be advisable to look at alternative ways to fund any energy efficiency measures, which they plan to introduce.</p> <p><strong>John Alker, director of policy at the <a href=\"http://www.ukgbc.org/\">UK Green Building Council</a>:</strong> There has been criticisms about the lack of financial guarantees. But where do you get guaranteed returns there these days? Pensions may go down as well as up, as do house prices. The only real surefire guarantee is that fossil-based energy prices must go up and therefore energy efficiency will pay in the long term. There seems to be complaining about complexity &ndash; but checks and balances are vital to protect consumers. Confidence is important. There's only one group that will do more to scupper an energy efficiency revolution than our politicians, and that's the media. Let&rsquo;s not kill the scheme before it&rsquo;s even begun &ndash; this is too important for point scoring. We&rsquo;re not naive, the&nbsp;green deal is no panacea &ndash; it&rsquo;s just one way to fund energy efficiency improvements. There is a whole industry to be built here &ndash; jobs, spending, energy demand reduction and security, which could be more valuable to the UK than the Olympics &ndash; we should get behind it.</p> <p><strong>Liz Male, chairman of <a href=\"http://www.trustmark.org.uk/\">TrustMark</a>, the government-endorsed quality mark for tradesmen:</strong> Our warning to homeowners, many of whom will not yet fully understand the full details of what&nbsp;green deal is all about, is that not all building work or other home improvements and repairs will be covered by a&nbsp;green deal plan and its consumer protection safeguards. Homeowners must be very clear with their&nbsp;green deal provider about what is or isn&rsquo;t included. Many homes will need essential repairs before any energy saving measures can be safely or effectively installed. Our advice to all customers is to check the credentials of any&nbsp;green deal firm, don&rsquo;t be tempted to ask an installer to do extra property repair work just because they are in your home anyway, and always insist on using a TrustMark-registered tradesman for any home repair, maintenance or improvement work. Our green deal leaflet is free to download at <a href=\"http://www.trustmark.org.uk/green-deal/\">www.trustmark.org.uk/green-deal/</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/CME/about/staff/t-j-dixon.aspx\">Prof Tim Dixon</a>, chair in sustainable futures in the built environment at the University of Reading&rsquo;s School of Construction Management and Engineering:</strong> More flexibility needs to be given to homeowners. Penalising those who pay back early under the deal is unfair and this should be amended under the Consumer Credit Act, as the government plans to do. Guaranteed \"independent\" assessments of actual energy use, rather than average energy, should be used as the basis for a \"personalised\" energy assessment. The Green Investment Bank also needs a more central role to enable better overall risk management of the scheme at lower, more attractive rates of interest.</p> <p>More permanent and wide-ranging incentives are needed such as differential stamp duty, council tax rebates, and tax breaks, along with clearer guidance on how to join the scheme. A national \"Low Carbon Cities Network\" would mean increased focus on city-wide financial packages which could help a range of towns and cities, linked with City Deals. However this requires a much more strategic approach to low carbon transition in the built environment so that energy efficiency measures at scale are incentivised and not prevented by contradictory planning and building regulations. It is also critical that more detailed guidance on how the scheme fits in with the requirement to &lsquo;let&rsquo; more energy efficient properties by 2016 and 2018.</p> <p>Much more work needs to be done on the&nbsp;green deal before the scheme becomes an effective way of improving energy efficiency. We will need to retrofit one house per minute until 2050 if we are to meet our national carbon emissions targets. So scaling up retrofit with financing that provides real incentives is key.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51064a85b579b4cc7f57508c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those still struggling to get their heads round how the green deal actually works - that's lots of us, it seems - here's the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hate-rising-energy-costs-green-deal-with-it\">government's own explainer</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Firstly, a green deal assessor will come to your home, talk to you about your energy use and see if you could benefit from making energy efficiency improvements. Your assessor will recommend improvements that are appropriate for your property and indicate whether they are expected to pay for themselves through reduced energy bills. Green deal providers will then quote for the recommended improvements. You can get as many quotes as you like, and you don&rsquo;t have to choose all of the recommendations made to you.</p> <p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a green deal provider, they will write up a green deal plan. The plan is a contract between you and the provider &ndash; it sets out the work that will be done and the repayments, including the fixed interest rate. Once you&rsquo;ve agreed to a green deal plan, your provider will arrange for the improvements to be made to your home by a&nbsp;green deal installer. You can then start to enjoy a more energy efficient home. Your green deal repayments will be automatically added to the electricity bill for the home.</p> <p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures\">www.gov.uk/greendeal</a></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51064921b579b4cc7f57508b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Adam Vaughan has put together this short video explaining some of the challenges facing the green deal...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2013/jan/25/green-deal-energy-bills-video?intcmp=122\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                                data-video-name=\"Will the green deal cut UK households' energy bills? - video\"                                > <iframe src=\"http://gu-embedded-video.appspot.com/?u=/environment/video/2013/jan/25/green-deal-energy-bills-video\" overflow:hidden scrolling=\"no\" width=\"460\" height=\"397\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5106452295cb80127a452426\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-28T17:08:21.785Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government's long-awaited flagship \"green deal\" home insulation programme <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hate-rising-energy-costs-green-deal-with-it\">launches today</a>.</p> <p>The scheme is intended to help finance - through government loans paid off incrementally via energy bills - otherwise unaffordable energy efficiency improvements, such as cavity-wall insulation, double-glazing, and loft-lagging.</p> <p>But the scheme has attracted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/27/green-deal-unlikely-deliver-promises\">lots of advance criticism</a>, in particular from those claiming the scheme is far from guaranteed to help households achieve lower energy bills, or that it could make homes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/jan/27/green-deal-home-hard-sell\">harder to sell</a>.

As has been pointed out repeatedly by the Met Office and many climate scientists, this is tantamount to picking the sweetest of cherries. The rate of decadal rise in average global temperatures has clearly slowed over the past decade or so, compared to the previous couple of decades, but to say it has \"stopped\" altogether seems to be a misleading statistical sleight of hand.</p> <p>It also strikes me as complacent, or even reckless, to assume that any slowing is proof that global warming is nothing to worry about. As many scientists in the field point out, there are several likely causes - both natural and anthropogenic variables - that could be masking or absorbing the so-called \"missing heat\", not least the oceans and/or soot released by the burning of coal in fast-industrialising nations such as China. To assume global warming has been falsified is, in my view, a very cavalier, wrong-headed display of long-term risk analysis.</p> <p>My reaction to the \"controversy\" triggered by the Met Office's latest decadal forecast is less focused on the news about a minor downward adjustment (again, the idea that it somehow shows global warming has \"stopped\" seems a particularly wayward interpretation of what the forecast actually states), but more on the fact that the Met Office should have press-released it on the day (Christmas Eve) it was published on its website. Instead, it gave the impression that it wished to \"bury\" the news, which, in turn, was predictably seized upon by its critics. In contrast, it should have been a story about how a newly improved modelling system had been used to produce an updated forecast, one which showed a decline in the predicted rate of warming over the near-term, but, nonetheless, a likely continuation of the decadal warming trend.</p> <p><em>P.S.

He begins by highlighting the \"big error bar\" in the new forecast:</p> <blockquote> <p>Atmospheric warming has certainly slowed greatly in the past decade. The Met Office says this appears to be due to natural cycles that are counteracting the warming effect of greenhouse gases. After incorporating new analysis of natural cycles into its latest model of atmospheric and ocean circulation, <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/decadal-fc\">it has concluded </a>that we are in for a few more years of little change.</p> <p>Having calculated annual global temperatures for the next five years, its best guess is that they will be, on average, 0.43&nbsp;&deg;C higher than the average for 1970 to 2000. That's down from its previous prediction of a 0.54&nbsp;&deg;C rise. If the new prediction proves right, then 2017 will barely be warmer than most years in the past decade.</p> <p>The forecast comes with a big error bar, however. The average warming for the next five years could be as much as 0.59&nbsp;&deg;C, or as little as 0.28&nbsp;&deg;C.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pearce goes on to highlight how \"oceans are the sleeping giant of climate change\":</p> <blockquote> <p>They act as a huge heat sink: 90 per cent of the heat generated by accumulating greenhouse gases <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news_archives/SydLevitus_WarmingOceans.html\">is absorbed by the oceans</a>. How fast this happens is variable, depending on ocean currents and other fluctuations.</p> <p>Scientists have known for a long time that in El Ni&ntilde;o years, when warm water spreads out across the equatorial Pacific, heat leaves the ocean for the atmosphere. But there are also longer-term cycles. The biggest cycles are known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Recently, both have been causing the oceans to absorb more heat, shutting off atmospheric warming...</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote> <p>So press reports that global warming is at a standstill are not true, even in the short term. Right now the oceans are taking up almost all the extra heat. That is most unlikely to persist.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ed7557b5798da9a21a2a4f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T14:56:35.924Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/richard-betts\">Richard Betts</a>, head of the climate impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre, has <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/20494695\">posted a comment</a> below to help clear up any possible confusion caused by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jan/09/global-warming-met-office-paused?commentpage=2#block-50ed4c93b5798da9a21a2a25\">BBC article I quoted</a> at the beginning of this Eco Audit:</p> <blockquote> <p>Please note that, as @bbcbias correctly states, the 0.43C warming is relative to 1971-2000, *not* this year.

Media outlets around the world have conflated 'surface temperatures' and 'global warming'. The fact is that heat that goes into melting ice, or the thermal expansion of the oceans, is as much a factor in climate change and a threat to our lives as heat going into raised surface temperatures. A pause in the latter means a surge in the former, as the earth's energy balance (heat received minus heat radiated) is still way too high, and getting higher.</p> <p>It is certainly true that climate scientists are having real difficulty predicting where heat is going to go - underestimating the amount being soaked up by the arctic icecap, overestimating the amount going into atmospheric warming. If there was rational coverage of the issue, this wouldn't cause any upset - the error bars were always there, and the firm predictions have been fulfilled (even though surface temperatures have sprung some surprises, the Met Office's expectation of two record breaking years between 2010 and 2015 is still well on course.</p> <p>But we urgently need the media to get these subtleties right in order to allow scientists to be straight with us, and not muttering and mumbling as they hear the lynch mob gathering.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ed66ef95cb949e60e1e097\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T14:56:35.924Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the same day that the Met Office confirmed it had adjusted its forecast, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/08/hottest-on-record-2012-america\">National Climatic Data Center</a> in the US confirmed that 2012 had been the hottest year on record across the 48 contiguous states - a full degree Fahrenheit hotter than the 1998 record.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/08/hottest-on-record-2012-america\">Suzanne Goldenberg's news story</a> for the Guardian.</p> <p>And here's a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2013/jan/09/america-hottest-year-record-state-map\">state-by-state map</a> showing the temperature records in more detail.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ed657bb5798da9a21a2a3c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T14:56:35.924Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting update has just been added to <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/01/why-the-met-office%E2%80%99s-revised-forecast-still-doesn%E2%80%99t-show-global-warming-has-stopped\">Roz Pidcock's post</a> at Carbon Brief:</p> <blockquote> <p>A sentence in the Met Office's <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/decadal-fc\"> revised global temperature forecast </a>reads \"The warmest year in the 160-year Met Office Hadley Centre global temperature record in 1998, with a temperature of 0.40&deg;C above long-term average\".

This includes a comprehensive set of improvements based on the latest scientific understanding.</p> <p>HadGEM3&nbsp;has been thoroughly tested and has more accurately reproduced temperature variations over the past few decades, suggesting it shows greater skill than was available from previous decadal forecast systems.</p> </blockquote> <p>An older <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/climate-models/hadgem3\">Met Office webpage</a> has some more detail about HadGEM3:</p> <blockquote> <p>HadGEM3 stands for the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3. The HadGEM3 family of models comprises a range of specific model configurations incorporating different levels of complexity but with a common physical framework. The HadGEM3 family includes a coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration, with or without a vertical extension in the atmosphere to include a well-resolved stratosphere, and an Earth-System configuration which includes dynamic vegetation, ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry.</p> <p>One of the main changes in the HadGEM3 family of models compared with previous versions is the inclusion of the <a href=\"http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/\">NEMO</a> ocean modelling framework, which is also used in the Met Office's ocean forecasting system, and <a href=\"http://oceans11.lanl.gov/trac/CICE\">CICE</a>, the Los Alamos sea ice model.

In fact, consistent with rising greenhouse gases, heat is continuing to build up beneath the ocean surface:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/climate-science-highlights/284-warming-over-the-last-decade-hidden-below-ocean-surface\">http://www.ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/climate-science-highlights/284-warming-over-the-last-decade-hidden-below-ocean-surface</a></p> <p>This indicates that changes in ocean circulation are in part responsible for the recent slower rate of surface warming. The way the ocean distributes the extra energy trapped by rising greenhouse gases is critical in determining the new Met Office forecasts of global surface temperature over the coming decade and is an area of active research.</p> <p>These decadal forecasts are very much experimental &ndash; they are at the cutting edge of the science and are technically very challenging. The Met Office are being open and transparent by making the forecasts available to allow a proper validation to occur. The Met Office is one of about 10 groups performing these type of forecasts worldwide and all predict a warming over the coming decade. Nothing in their data leads me to think that global warming due to human influence has stopped, or is irrelevant. It hasn&rsquo;t, and it isn't.</p> <p><strong>Prof Myles Allen</strong><strong>, head of the climate dynamics group at the University of Oxford: </strong>Comparing the expected temperature for 2013-2017 with a single exceptionally warm year (1998), as some reports have done, is just daft. 1998 was around 0.2 degrees warmer than the 1996-2000 average, largely thanks to a massive, once-a-century El Nino event. The IPCC predicted a warming of 0.1-0.2 degrees per decade due to human influence back in 2000. That means the one-off impact of that El Nino event was equivalent to about 20 years of the expected background warming trend So, unsurprisingly, 20 years later, expected temperatures have risen so that an average year is now as warm as that exceptionally hot year.</p> <p>That said, a lot of people (not the IPCC) were claiming, in the run-up to the Copenhagen 2009 conference, that &lsquo;warming was accelerating and it is all worse than we thought&rsquo;. What has happened since then has demonstrated that it is foolish to extrapolate short-term climate trends. We did see unexpectedly fast warming from the mid-1990s to the early-2000s, but the IPCC, quite correctly, did not suggest this was evidence for acceleration.&nbsp;</p> <p>While every new year brings in welcome new data to help us rule out the more extreme (good and bad) scenarios for the future, it would be equally silly to interpret what has happened since the early-2000s as evidence that the warming has stopped.</p> <p><strong>Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, director, Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London: </strong>The current news item that the Met Office now predicts no global warming in the period up to 2017 is based on the latest 5-year forecast run with their new climate model. Such forecasts are at the frontiers of the subject and form part of a research programme in this area in the Met Office and elsewhere, but should not be considered to be predictions.</p> <p>One interpretation of the forecasts is for little warming from 1998 until 2017. This is consistent with a multi-decadal fluctuation in temperature that presently opposes the continued upward trend. However the two supported one another during the rapid warming in the 1990s and can be expected to do this again in the future, leading to another period of rapid warming. The forecast results also suggest that half the years in the period to 2017 would be expected to give new record global temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Prof Chris Rapley, professor of climate science at University College London: </strong>I despair of the way data such as this is translated as &lsquo;global warming has stopped&rsquo;! Global mean temperatures - whether measured or predicted - are not the issue. What matters is the energy balance of the planet and the changes that an energy imbalance will drive in the climate system - as well as the consequences for humans.</p> <p>90% of the energy imbalance enters the ocean and is not visible to the global mean surface temperature value. The continuing rise in sea level demonstrates ongoing energy accumulation in the ocean (as well as a contribution from melting land ice).</p> <p>Even if the global mean temperature were to remain unchanged, if the geographic patterns of temperature and rainfall change, the consequences will still be potentially severe. We only need to look at what is going on in Australia at this very moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ed5a4595cb949e60e1e07e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T14:56:35.924Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Comment</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a snapshot of some of the commentary that has been published...</p> <p>Mark Lynas in the Times (and <a href=\"http://www.marklynas.org/2013/01/global-warming-does-exist/\">reposted on his blog</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>This was the story that the scientists &ldquo;tried to bury&rdquo;; yet more evidence that global warming is at a standstill &mdash; or so it seemed to climate sceptics.</p> <p>The reality about the Met Office&rsquo;s new decadal forecast is more prosaic, and also more complicated: it has indeed issued some predictions for how global temperatures might change between now and 2017, but these are not like long-range weather forecasts. They are experimental projections assessing the probabilities of different temperature outcomes averaged out over the whole globe.</p> <p>Nor is it true that these show a downgrading of global warming. Although five years is a short time period for assessing a changing climate, it is still likely that the planet will continue to warm and that new temperature records will be set. The Met Office also make clear that warming is driven by increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, not natural fluctuations.</p> </blockquote> <p>David Whitehouse on the <a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.org/met-office-forecasts-global-temperature-rise/\">Global Warming Policy Foundation website</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>If the latest Met Office prediction is correct, and it accords far more closely with the observed data than previous predictions, then it will prove to be a lesson in humility. It will show that the previous predictions that were given so confidently as advice to the UK government and so unquestioningly accepted by the media, were wrong, and that the so-called sceptics who were derided for questioning them were actually on the right track.</p> </blockquote> <p>Roz Pidcock on the <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/01/why-the-met-office%E2%80%99s-revised-forecast-still-doesn%E2%80%99t-show-global-warming-has-stopped\">Carbon Brief website</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>To put the new forecast in context with current global temperatures, 1998 was the warmest year on record - according to the Met Office Hadley Centre global temperature record, with a global temperature of 0.40 degrees above the long term average. This is 0.03 degrees lower than the best estimate for temperature rise by 2017 given in the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/decadal-fc\"> new forecast</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Paul Hudson, a BBC weather presenter, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulhudson/2013/01/met-office-scale-back-global-w.shtml\">on his blog</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The new projection, if correct, would mean there will have been little additional warming for two decades despite rising greenhouse gases. It's bound to raise questions about the robustness and reliability of computer simulations that governments around the world are using in order to determine policies aimed at combating global warming.</p> <p>The Met Office says natural cycles have caused the recent slowdown in warming, including perhaps changes in the suns activity, and ocean currents. And mainstream climate scientists, who are in a majority, say that when the natural cooling factors change again, temperatures will be driven up further by greenhouse gases.</p> <p>But climate sceptics, who have long argued that natural processes are either underestimated, or not properly understood, will not be surprised at this scaling back of expected warming.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ed55e095cb949e60e1e07d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T14:56:35.924Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Media coverage</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Various outlets have reported on the Met Office's announcement.

Climate sceptic bloggers soon <a href=\"http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/major-change-in-uk-met-office-global-warming-forecast/\">picked it up</a> and on 7 January Roger Harrabin, the BBC's environment analyst, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RHarrabin/status/288395490540806144\">tweeted</a> that the Met Office had confirmed to him that it had cut its warming projection for the period up to 2017 by 20%. He followed it up yesterday with a brief item on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which, in turn, was later fleshed out by David Shukman, the BBC's science editor, in an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20947224\">article on the BBC News website </a>[<em>the article was amended by the BBC on 10 January to correct the second sentence; the quote below reflects that change which stresses the projected rise is marked against the long-term average as opposed to present day</em>]:</p> <blockquote> <p>The UK Met Office has revised one of its forecasts for how much the world may warm in the next few years. It says that the average temperature is&nbsp;likely to be 0.43 C above the long-term average by 2017 - as opposed to an earlier forecast that suggested a warming of 0.54C.</p> <p>The explanation is that a new kind of computer model using different parameters has been used. The Met Office stresses that the work is experimental and that it still stands by its longer-term projections. These forecast significant warming over the course of this century.</p> <p>The forecasts are all based on a comparison with the average global temperature over the period 1971-2000. The earlier model had projected that the period 2012-16 would be 0.54C above that long-term average - within a range of uncertainty from 0.36-0.72C. By contrast the new model, known as HadGEM3, gives a rise about one-fifth lower than that of 0.43C - within a range of 0.28-0.59.</p> </blockquote> <p>The news has been seized upon by climate sceptics who were already arguing that global warming had \"stopped\" since the record breaking year of 1998 and that this new development further undermines both climate science itself as well as any policy response to rising temperatures. Climate scientists have responded saying that to draw such a conclusion is misleading.</p> <p>Please leave your own thoughts below.

I'm not against it per se - I believe it can be part of the UK's energy mix, if it helps us to relinquish coal - but I do think we need to proceed with caution.</p> <p>I am, therefore, pleased to see in today's announcement by the UK government that in allowing the resumption of test drilling in Lancashire it can only do so with tight oversight and regulation. It appears obvious that we are still many years away from reaching the stage where shale gas is exploited commercially in the UK - and even when, or if, that moment arrives it will unlikely ever be on the scale seen in the US. Those that try to directly compare the US situation to the UK are, in large part, misinforming this important debate. There appear to be far more differences than similarities, in my view.</p> <p>An important next step after the excitement and anger that has greeted today's new is to establish much more information about precisely how much shale gas is recoverable. Until we do so, this debate will continue to be hindered by a fug of contradiction and confusion. And then we must digest the all-important report commissioned today by Decc that will examine the full carbon life-cycle of shale gas. What the government does with that information will present a far bigger decision than it has made today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ca0ddd95cbcfe457e3ddf0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/29/shale-gas-fracking-green-carbon#block-14\">referenced back in May</a> when I last examined shale gas in the Eco Audit, it's worth recalling the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/communication/news-archive/2011/shale-gas-expansion-would-jeopardise-climate-commitments\">report on shale gas</a> published by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in January 2011 and updated late last year:</p> <blockquote> <p>Irrespective of whether UK shale gas substitutes for coal, renewables or imported gas, the industry's latest reserve estimates for just one licence area could account for up to 15% of the UK's emissions budget through to 2050. Therefore, emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen accord and low carbon transition plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel. Moreover, any significant and early development of the industry is likely to prove either economically unwise or risk jeopardising the UK's international reputation on climate change. Against such a quantifiable and stark evaluation, it is difficult to conclude other than the UK needs to invest in very low carbon energy supply if it is to both abide by its international obligations and support economically sustainable technologies.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ca099b95cbcfe457e3ddec\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has just posted a blog headlined: \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/dec/13/shale-gas-fracking-davey\">This fracking fantasy is the delusion of fossil fuel addiction</a>\":</p> <blockquote> <p>This is nothing more than the delusion of addiction. Like all addictions, our fossil fuel craving tempts us to ignore inconvenient truths that threaten our next fix. The simple reality for shale gas in Europe is that no serious, independent authority, from the International Energy Agency down, thinks fracking will provide <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/28/shale-gas-fracking-uk-carbon-energy\">enough gas to dent its price in Europe</a>. As the government's own advisers set out today, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/13/gas-energy-bills-renewables\">over-reliance on gas exposes consumers to far higher hikes</a>in bills.</p> <p>Those memorably dubbed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/09/shale-gas-frackheads-dubious-dream\">frack-heads by Andrew Rawnsley</a> tend to ignore <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a> but the prime minister did not. Instead, he prescribed the equivalent of a drug user dealing with a wild high by swallowing a fistful of downers. If the gas revolution did come to pass, Cameron said, then capturing and burying the emissions would deal with climate change. Yet fitting that expensive technology in order to burn \"cheap\" gas is like happily getting addicted to heroin because you can check into rehab later.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ca082c95cbcfe457e3ddea\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lawrencecarter1\">Lawrence Carter</a>, a Greenpeace climate campaigner, has <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/12/coalitions-support-fracking-based-ideology-not-evidence\">written a piece for the New Statesman</a> chiding the government - particularly George Osborne - for basing its pro-fracking energy policy on \"ideology rather than evidence\":</p> <blockquote> <p>So how likely is it that we&rsquo;ll enjoy a US style fracking revolution here? Not very, say experts.

Deutsche Bank, for example, concluded that &ldquo;those waiting for a shale gas &lsquo;revolution&rsquo; outside the US will likely be disappointed, in terms of both price and the speed at which high-volume production can be achieved&rdquo;. While the IEA have outlined how European shale gas will be 50 per cent more expensive to extract.</p> <p>Yet Osborne is betting the farm, and the UK&rsquo;s energy future, on fracking bringing costs down enough to make it economic to run almost half our power supply off gas...</p> <p>Precisely why Osborne has chosen to ignore the facts in order to pursue his dash for gas is for others to speculate. But for consumers up and down the UK, not to mention our attempts to tackle the urgent threat of climate change, it would be infinitely more reassuring if our energy policy was based on evidence rather than ideology.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ca053295cbcfe457e3dde6\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cuadrilla's reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cuadrilla, the private company given permission today to resume its fracking exploration in Lancashire, has, unsurprisingly, <a href=\"http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/news/cuadrilla-news/article/decc-announcement-marks-turning-point-for-uk-energy/\">welcomed the news</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Today&rsquo;s news is a turning point for the country&rsquo;s energy future. Shale gas has the potential to create jobs, generate tax revenues, reduce our reliance on imported gas, and improve our balance of payments,&rdquo; said Francis Egan, CEO of Cuadrilla Resources. &ldquo;Our exploration has shown that under Lancashire there is a belt of gas-filled shale over one mile thick. Today&rsquo;s decision will allow continued exploration and testing of the UK&rsquo;s very significant shale resources in a way that fulfils the highest environmental and community standards.</p> <p>Cuadrilla is pleased that Decc has recognized the major improvements it has made. The company is ready to move ahead with its plans, involving the hydraulic fracturing and flow testing of a number of wells in Lancashire in 2013. Before these further exploration and testing plans can proceed, Cuadrilla will work closely with Decc and its representatives, Lancashire County Council, the Environment Agency, the HSE, the local communities and other relevant parties to obtain regulatory approvals and planning permission.</p> <p>In cooperation with Decc, Cuadrilla has already taken a number of steps to further reduce environmental risk. Key among these is an advanced system for seismic monitoring that allows Cuadrilla and DECC to closely monitor and regulate hydraulic fracturing activity.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323981504578176704285107828.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Wall Street Journal</a> also has an interview with Cuadrilla's Francis Egan:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. Egan said that Cuadrilla, which obtained a license to explore in Lancashire in 2008, but had to halt fracking last year following minor earthquakes in the area, is spending \"several million pounds\" on advanced systems for seismic monitoring.</p> <p>It must also get approval from local authorities, a process that is likely to take several months, Mr. Egan said. Cuadrilla is expected to start fracking in the first half of next year in two or three wells, he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9ffcbb579d49737370f4f\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Price of natural gas</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There's lots of talk about how the shale gas \"revolution\" has caused natural gas prices in the US to plummet in recent years - and how it might/might not do the same in the UK.

A statement just released by Lilly Morse, a <a href=\"http://frack-off.org.uk/\">Frack Off</a> campaigner:</p> <blockquote> <p>The long expected announcement that the government will allow fracking companies to continue attempts at exploitation of unconventional gas is the start of a major battle over what sort of world we will leave to our children. The government and industry&rsquo;s promises of cheap, abundant gas are deluded. In the US the gas bubble has already burst with fracking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Drilling has ground to a halt and gas prices have doubled since the beginning of the year. The governments strategy of relying on fracking to fuel a new wave of gas fired power stations is utterly insane. Fracking is dirty, destructive and extremely expensive, and could never deliver the quantities of gas envisaged. In the last year and a half, a growing number of communities have begun organising to oppose fracking. Those communities can now clearly see that if they do not win this fight they will be sacrificed for the profits of vested interests. The evidence from the US and Australia that fracking destroys water supplies, air quality, ecosystems, and people&rsquo;s health has been mounting for years, and is now too strong to ignore. Waiting for even more impacts to be discovered is not an option.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9fc2e95cbcfe457e3ddde\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dissent in the shires (namely, key constituencies for the Conservative party) is already surfacing at the news of fracking being allowed to resume. Here's <a href=\"http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/fracking-concerns-remain-in-west-sussex-as-process-set-to-resume-in-uk-1-4583927\">some reaction in Sussex</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Vanessa Vine, a Balcombe resident, of Frack Free Sussex (FFS), fears for the ecological future around the site as it is near the London to Brighton railway line, the River Ouse, Ardingly Reservoir, and a Grade II listed viaduct.</p> <p>&ldquo;The threat is not only to our seismic security, but puts in jeopardy our wild ecology, our farmland and thereby our health, through industrialisation of our landscape and resultant contamination of soil, air and groundwater,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;It beggars belief that our legislators appear set to allow hydraulic fracturing to be carried out.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Paul Miner, senior planning officer at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Before commercial scale extraction happens, there must be a full and transparent planning process. The government doesn&rsquo;t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level. If fracking is to happen, it must be with the support of local communities, who are most at risk if things go wrong, and without damaging the countryside.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9f79195cbcfe457e3ddd5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=About_us\">UK Energy Research Centre</a> (UKERC), which \"carries out world-class research into sustainable future energy systems\", has put out a <a href=\"http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=2450\">press release</a> containing reaction to Davey's announcement. It says the announcement \"should not be interpreted as a green light for wide spread commercial development of shale gas in the UK\":</p> <blockquote> <p>UKERC gas expert Professor Michael Bradshaw says: \"Only an exploratory drilling programme can provide the information needed to arrive at a better assessment of the reserve base, but the US experience suggests that even that will provide limited understanding. It is only by extensive drilling that commercial levels of production can be guaranteed. Any further decisions must assess the commercial viability of shale gas in the UK, against the regulatory costs and tax regime, the environmental impacts (both direct in relation to the drilling activity and indirect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions) and the wider societal acceptance of the industry. In short, shale gas will remain a conditional resource in the UK for some-time to come.\"</p> <p>Christophe McGlade helped conduct a UKERC review into shale gas resources, he reinforces this view saying: \"Estimates of technically recoverable resources are significantly more useful than the much more speculative and rather less helpful estimates of gas in place. Drilling will also aid estimation of the potential for economic recovery of these resources. Exploratory drilling will hence reduce the uncertainties that currently exist over the size of the UK resource base and allow a more evidence based discussion on the potential role of shale gas in the UK energy system.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9f47b95cbcfe457e3ddd1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Professor Robert Mair, chair of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering review of shale gas <a href=\"http://t.co/MwI19DFJ\">published earlier this year</a>, has commented on today's announcement:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are pleased to see the government recognise the importance of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/29/shale-gas-fracking-expanded-regulated?intcmp=122\">joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report</a> on the geological and environmental risks of shale gas extraction in the UK. We welcomed the opportunity to discuss our recommendations with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency recently and commend their commitment to implementing the recommendations set out in our report. Our report concluded that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation. It is now up to the government, regulatory bodies and operators to ensure that these responsibilities are met.&nbsp;</p> <p>Safeguarding well integrity is at the heart of ensuring that risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively. Our report highlighted the need for continued monitoring by independent experts to ensure that each well is designed, constructed and operated in a safe and responsible manner. We strongly encourage both the government and the operators to implement a properly independent examination and onsite inspection programme so that the public can have confidence in the process.</p> <p>The decision by Ed Davey to commission a study of the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be welcomed. There are few reliable estimates of the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction and potential methane leakages during the extraction process have been highlighted as a concern, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas. The findings of this study will be important in deciding the future of large scale extraction of shale gas in the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the time the review was published, <a href=\"http://t.co/MwI19DFJ\">I wrote an article</a> asking why it had failed to investigate the potential climate impact of exploiting shale gas reserves. I still find the omission rather mystifying, given its obvious significance.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9eefc95cbcfe457e3ddc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Extent of shale gas in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you want a better sense of where other than Lancashire shale gas could be fracked in the UK, it's worth taking a look at these <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmenergy/795/795we02.htm\">maps and charts</a> produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change last year. (The British Geological Survey has a <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/howMuch.html\">handy page</a> on all this, too.)</p> <p>When I spoke to the BGS earlier this week, it said that it is currently only producing an estimate of the gas potentially recoverable in the Bowland Shales. This geological formation spreads from underneath Lancashire out to the eastern Irish sea and across to the western section of the North Sea. The BGS believes that it is \"thickest\" under the Irish Sea, but, to date, fracking is only being considered onshore.</p> <p>The BGS also admitted to me that its previous reserve estimates (<a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/introduction.html\">as much as 150bn cubic metres</a>) had been \"back of the fag packet\" in comparison to the report it is preparing for Decc at the moment. It is worth noting, though, its conclusion when it produced its 2010 estimate (<a href=\"http://og.decc.gov.uk/assets/og/bo/onshore-paper/UK-onshore-shalegas.pdf\">pdf</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>Even if one assumes that the American shale gas producing analogies are valid, many of the operating conditions are different in the UK. In the UK, land owners do not own mineral rights, so there is less incentive to support development, and local authorities must grant planning consent. The US has relatively permissive environmental regulations, low population densities, tax incentives, existing infrastructure, well developed supply chains and access to technology. Cumulatively, these factors mean that it is far from certain that the conditions that underpin shale gas production in North America will be replicable in the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>The BGS also told me that it is possibly better to look at how shale gas is being exploited in Poland, rather than the US: \"It's a window into where the UK might be in 5-6 years.\"</p> <p>Here's a video of Ed Hough, a BGS geologist, talking about shale gas in the UK...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gylj_52uOfg\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gylj_52uOfg?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>And if you really want to, er, drill down into this subject, here's a 40-minute presentation about shale gas in the UK given in June by <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/staff/profiles/3109.html\">Prof Mike Stephenson</a>, the BGS's head of energy...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qKMeto4ju8\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-qKMeto4ju8?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9de9eb579d49737370f39\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The International Energy Agency is not due to launch its \"<a href=\"http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/events/event/name,33544,en.html\">Medium-Term Coal Market Report-2012</a>\" until next Tuesday. (Yes, don't tell me: you all had it in your diaries already). However, a <a href=\"http://www.environmental-expert.com/news/iea-to-launch-medium-term-coal-market-report-on-18-december-337545\">press release</a> giving a taster of the report has already surfaced online:</p> <blockquote> <p>The international coal market is experiencing dynamic changes. In 2011, China alone accounted for more than three-quarters of incremental coal production, while domestic consumption was more than three times that of global trade. Low gas prices associated with the <a href=\"http://www.environmental-expert.com/articles/keyword-shale-gas-17498\">shale gas</a> revolution caused a marked decrease in coal use in the United States, the world&rsquo;s second-largest consumer. This led US thermal coal producers to seek other markets, which resulted in an oversupply of coal in Europe and a significant gas-to-coal switch.</p> </blockquote> <p>Is the IEA report really going to argue that the US shale gas \"revolution\" (a term David Cameron was keen to adopt this week when discussing the UK's shale gas prospects) has, somewhat perversely, led to an <em>increase</em> in coal use in Europe?! If so, that would be an unfortunate - and unforeseen - side effect.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9da0895cbcfe457e3ddb9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael Liebreich, CEO of <a href=\"http://about.bnef.com/\">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>, published some <a href=\"http://about.bnef.com/2012/10/31/bnef-chief-executive-michael-liebreich-vip-comment-uk-energy-policy-a-time-of-consequences/\">interesting analysis</a> on shale gas at the end of October and, in particular, its likely impact on UK energy prices:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no reason to believe that it will push gas prices down in the UK in the same way as they have recently in the U.S. Shale gas has been an astonishing success story there, within a few years shifting the country from being a long-term gas importer to a potential exporter, and pushing prices down from $6-11 per mmBtu to as low as $1.73 in April. There are caveats. The U.S. gas price has rebounded by over 90 percent from its lows, and is now around $3.50 per mmBtu. Some wells can make money at very low prices, though most cannot. As Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp.&rsquo;s chief executive, recently said of the U.S. shale gas miracle: &ldquo;We are all losing our shirts today. You know, we&rsquo;re making no money. It&rsquo;s all in the red.&rdquo; </p> <p>The fact is that shale gas operators in the US need a gas price of around $5 per mmBtu in order to justify continuing to drill, frack and build pipelines. All analysts expect the U.S. natural gas price to rise to $5 or $6 per mmBtu. Bloomberg New Energy Finance&rsquo;s own predictions are for a price of $5.50 by end-2015. And that is in the US, where conditions are ideal for shale gas: great geology, low population density, an existing pipeline network, a fragmented regulatory environment, landowners with sub-surface mineral rights and a liquid market for rigs and drilling services. Given conditions in the U.K., it is hard to see shale gas coming to market at much below $8 per mmBtu &ndash; around the same as the wholesale prices that have been driving up utility bills in recent years. </p> </blockquote> <p>He continues:</p> <blockquote> <p>In order to replace the decline of UK Continental Shelf gas production through 2030 &ndash; before starting to replace any coal or nuclear power &ndash; you would need 2,400 fracked wells. Assume 10 wells per pad, and that is 240 pads. Each one is an industrial development in the countryside, and this number would extend over an area the size of Lancashire. In terms of production per well, at its peak, one fracked well can produce enough gas to match the output of 50 onshore or 15 offshore wind turbines. However, the decline curve of a fracked well is so steep that within two years, each well could replace as few as four onshore or one offshore turbine (and yes, these figures are adjusted for the efficiency of gas generation and the intermittency of wind).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9d3c695cbcfe457e3ddb3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's Ed Davey making his Commons statement earlier on the resumption of fracking...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/dec/13/fracking-suspension-lifted-uk-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                                data-video-name=\"Fracking suspension lifted in UK - video\"                                > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/dec/13/fracking-suspension-lifted-uk-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/dec/13/fracking-suspension-lifted-uk-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>And here's the BBC News channel discussing the news with Mark Wallace of the Institute of Directors, who says the \"government has made the right decision\"...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGDJZv0RL1Y\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HGDJZv0RL1Y?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9d079b579d49737370f33\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over on the Guardian's Comment is Free, a Debate of the Day has just launched. Much like this Eco Audit, it is asking: \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas\">Fracking for shale gas: the right way forward?</a>\". It features Mark Lynas, the environmental author, and David Santillo, senior scientist for Greenpeace. Here's a taster...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Lynas:</strong> Gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but because coal is currently cheaper than gas the UK's carbon emissions are higher than they need to be. Shale gas could reverse this situation as it has in the US, where coal is in decline and emissions are falling. In the longer term, however, gas-fired power stations should be required to capture their emissions through carbon capture and storage technologies.</p> <p><strong>Santillo:</strong> It appears that the greenhouse gas \"footprint\" of shale gas may be significantly greater than for conventional gas and has even be claimed by some to be worse than coal. Greenpeace is therefore opposed to the exploitation of unconventional gas reserves until the impacts are fully investigated, understood, addressed and regulated. We call for significant more effort to be put into understanding the full impacts of fracking.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9cf3a95cbcfe457e3ddb0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Activism</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is becoming clear that any company seeking to frack for shale gas in the UK will be met with resistance from local campaigners and environmental groups. This seems to be reflected in a recent report (<a href=\"http://www.controlrisks.com/Oversized%20assets/shale_gas_whitepaper.pdf\">pdf</a>) on \"anti-fracking activisim\" published by Control Risks, an \"independent, global risk consultancy specialising in helping organisations manage political, integrity and security risks in complex and hostile environments\". On pg 15 of the report it describes the risk in the UK as \"significant\". It describes \"significant\" as meaning:</p> <blockquote> <p>Activist groups are well-organised and actively network internationally. Campaigns are directed specifically against unconventional gas development. Social activism poses considerable political risks and moderate operational and security risks to unconventional gas development.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, I've just been sent this note by the <a href=\"http://fuelpovertyaction.org.uk/\">Fuel Poverty Action</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Shame on Ed Davey for caving in to the Big Six energy companies and George Osborne. People across the UK will suffer at the hands of Davey's spinelessness. Fracking means higher fuel bills, earthquakes and cancer, as well as spelling disaster for the climate. In contrast, renewables are clean, safe and would save the average household &pound;500 off their fuel bills over the coming decades.

It doesn't seem to be sold on the idea that fracking automatically leads to cheaper energy bills (nor that it would help the UK meet its carbon targets):</p> <blockquote> <p>The value of a low-carbon portfolio will depend on future gas prices, which are not expected to fall in the UK, and carbon prices, which are expected to rise:<br />&bull; The International Energy Agency&rsquo;s projections for European gas prices in the 2020s suggest that these would be in line with DECC&rsquo;s central scenario (i.e. slightly higher than currently and broadly flat from 2020, at around 70 p/therm) under a world with significant utilisation of unconventional (e.g. shale) gas resources (Figure 5.1). If the extraction of unconventional gas is more limited, then costs would rise to 2030 (i.e. to reach around 85 p/therm in 2030).<br />&bull; The Government&rsquo;s carbon price underpin implies an acceleration in carbon prices in the 2020s (i.e. this is set to rise from &pound;32/tCO2 in 2020 to &pound;76/tCO2 in 2030. Beyond this, the Government&rsquo;s carbon values assume rising carbon costs to around &pound;200/tCO2 in 2050, whilst global carbon price modelling suggests significantly higher prices are also possible (e.g. modelling for the Committee by UCL suggests that carbon prices in 2050 could reach around &pound;500/tCO2 even with an active global carbon market taking advantage of trading opportunities to minimise global abatement costs, see Figure 5.2).</p> </blockquote> <p>(Go to pg 55 of the <a href=\"http://hmccc.s3.amazonaws.com/ENERGYbill12/1672_CCC_Energy-Bills_bookmarked.pdf\">PDF of the report</a> for the figures referenced above.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9c135b579d49737370f24\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-12341993-a6f5-4fc2-9087-15b240ef56bb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354805762804/a539eca7-6042-43f6-8241-58ac0c47ccbf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks to the media in a wooly hat\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Boris Johnson speaks to the media in a woolly hat.

Plenty of interest and debate already...</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/20025517\">DoctorChris</a>: The critical issue will be how much fugitive methane escapes when the gas is produced, and how much CO2 will be released when the gas is burned. Shale gas from fracking should have to pay for any climate change impacts that these cause, at about &pound;60 per tonne for the CO2, and perhaps 20 times that for any methane released.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/2742894\">londonlandlord</a>: If the country starts capturing the global warming gas carbon dioxide from coal power plants and injecting it underground, there is a potential for a larger quakes given the amount of the heat-trapping gas that would have to be buried That's an issue that needs more study. When are we going to hear \"concerns\" about the above?</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/3578530\">EnviroCapitalist</a>: It seems to have taken an awful long time to reach this decision. Britain is going to be reliant on gas for a long time to come. This is even more the case if there is a substantial investment in renewables, which will need substantial backup capacity. Even the technical people at FoE and Greenpeace accept this - though their political people don't mention this. The only way to escape gas would be to go all out for nuclear power, which isn't going to happen. At the same time, Britian is currently producing 40% of its electricity from coal. Replacing this with gas is an instant environmental win. Replacing this with local gas is an instant economic win. We also use a lot of gas for heating - heating with anything else is a long way off. Better that our gas is locally produced gas rather than Russian gas or Qatari gas. Yes, standards of production need to be high and verified. Caudrilla say all the right things on their website, but this will need to be verified. The gas won't be very cheap, but that is because of the work needed to extract it - which means jobs.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9b81f95cbcfe457e3dd8c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I've spotted some details within the various statements and documents released by Decc that are likely to further fuel the debate over fracking in the UK. For example, here are a few snippets from Davey's statement that caught my eye:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So far as Cuadrilla&rsquo;s current exploration programme in Lancashire is concerned, the remedial action level for the traffic light system (that is, the &ldquo;red light&rdquo;) will be set at magnitude 0.5 (far below a perceptible surface event, but larger than the expected level generated by the fracturing of the rock). I consider that this is an appropriately precautionary approach. We received representations in our consultation that this is too cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that Cuadrilla <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-19334578\">caused a 2.3 magnitude tremor</a> during its previous wave of test drilling (and it <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_047/pn12_047.aspx\">lobbied for a 1.7 limit</a>), how will this new 0.5 \"red light\" affect its forthcoming exploration?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Other concerns which have been expressed are not to do with the current phase of exploration work but with the implications of a possible future move to production operations, if the exploration is successful. It is by no means certain that any such operations will ever be proposed, but if they were, a different set of considerations would arise...</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a big reminder by Davey that he has only granted the resumption of exploration, not production. A big difference. In other words, there are still <em>many</em> hurdles to clear before the UK sees fracking on the scale currently seen in the US.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So far as the use of chemicals is concerned, the environment agencies take a risk-based approach to the regulation of the use of chemicals in shale gas fracking activities. The hazard potential of all substances proposed to be injected into the ground will be assessed and the use of substances hazardous to groundwater will not be permitted. The identity of all substances proposed for injection, and the agency&rsquo;s conclusions on their hazard potential, will be publicly available.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the US, the secrecy by some companies about the chemicals they use during fracking has caused considerable disquiet and distrust. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the UK government will insist such information is made public.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Concern has also been expressed about the quantities of water used in fracking, or the disposal of waste water from the process. The water used may of course be obtained from licensed suppliers, but if directly abstracted by the operators, requires a licence from the environment agency. Licences will only be given where the agency is satisfied that a sustainable supply is obtainable.</p> <p>Equally, disposal of waste water is subject to scrutiny by the agencies and will require a permit. The waste water from the operations in Lancashire has been found to contain low levels of radioactivity. A case-specific radiological assessment is required in support of any application for a permit for the disposal of radioactive waste. The agency will critically review any such assessment, and will only issue a permit if satisfied.</p> </blockquote> <p>Expect the issue of water contamination to be a key battleground for environmentalists and local communities keen to stop fracking.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>DECC has come to the conclusion that Cuadrilla&rsquo;s response to the occurrence of the tremors demonstrated some weaknesses in its management of environmental risks. This conclusion has been discussed with the company, and they have in consequence reinforced their overall management structure, including by assigning to one board member specific responsibility for health and safety measures, and by reinforcing technical skills within the operational team. The effectiveness of these changes, and the resulting revised structure, is at present being reviewed for Cuadrilla by external consultants.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davey is clearly indicating that Cuadrilla has been placed on the naughty step and will be watched very closely indeed by regulators. One further slip up by Cuadrilla could be disastrous for the prospects of fracking in the UK.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I intend to commission a study into the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions. This will consider the available evidence on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from shale gas exploitation, and the need for further research. I have invited Professor David Mackay, my Department&rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser and Dr Tim Stone, the Expert Chair of the Office of Nuclear Development to undertake this work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Arguably, this is the key environmental question hanging over fracking. This study should have, perhaps, been commissioned <em>before</em> the green-light was given by Davey, but, nonetheless, plenty of attention and scrutiny will be give to the Mackay and Stone report when it is published.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are also taking steps to prepare the way for any future production phase, though this is likely to be some years away. We have commissioned more detailed work on the shale gas resources of Great Britain from the British Geological Survey (BGS) and this will be published early next year. I emphasise that this will provide only an estimate of the resource, the gas in the ground, and not the reserves, the amount of gas which can in practice be produced economically from that resource. Until more exploration work has been done, a significant number of wells fracked and production patterns established over time, it will not be possible to make any meaningful estimate of likely economically recoverable resources of shale gas in the United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <p>Again, another key part of Davey's statement. There is currently lots of noise being generated, particularly by shale gas enthusiasts, about the \"game-changing\" amounts of it under the ground waiting to be exploited. But it is little more than optimistic guesswork, at present. Until Decc publishes the BGS report in, as I've been told, January, treat any firm statements about the quantity and quality of \"gas in place\" and \"recoverable reserves\" (there's a huge difference between the two) with extreme caution. And even then, the BGS is telling me that its report will still be an estimate based, in part, on Cuadrilla's \"gas content\" figures from its 2-3 test rigs. The BGS admits it needs data from dozens, if not hundreds, of wells to make a more accurate estimate.</p> <p>Finally, I haven't had a chance to fully go through this Q&amp;A on fracking (<a href=\"http://og.decc.gov.uk/assets/og/ep/onshore/7268-sg-qa.pdf\">pdf</a>) posted by Decc, but I did spot this on pg 31:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Why would the UK exploit shale gas when it is clearly not aligned to</em> <em>managing global warming?</em><br />Shale gas production would in the first place replace declining offshore gas production and reduce reliance on external supplies. Beyond that point, use of gas could displace use of coal in generation, with a positive effect on GHG reduction (provided fugitive emissions are subject to proper controls as outlined above).</p> <p><em>Investment in shale gas must be at the expense of investment in renewables?</em><br />It is too early to say whether shale gas will be able to contribute significantly to our sources of gas supplies for the future. But the recently published gas generation strategy confirms that the government sees a significant role for gas into the future; while continuing development of renewable supply will be essential to meeting our targets for renewables and wider climate change goals.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't know about you, but I find these answers far too vague to be reassuring.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9af9bb579d49737370f0c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reaction to Davey's announcement is arriving at a furious pace. I will try to include as much as I can as the day continues, but here's a taster:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/staff/profiles/1516.html\">Dr Nick Riley</a>, head of science policy (Europe) at the British Geological Survey:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Drilling and testing for shale gas will allow Britain to assess whether we have an economic resource and how it can be accessed with minimum impact to the environment. Gas is the greenest of the fossil fuels and may have a role in reducing carbon emissions in countries which are dependent on coal for electricity generation, but shale gas also has high emissions from all the energy used in drilling and fracking. If gas power generation is connected with carbon capture and storage the convenience of home grown gas can be combined with very low emissions to help keep Britain within its emissions targets.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/people?cw_xml=person.html&amp;indv=470\">Prof Stuart Haszeldine</a>, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK undoubtedly has some shale gas resource and, if the relevant environmental regulations and monitoring are enforced, this can be a lower carbon source of fossil energy than imported gas. Fracking is well established in the subsurface industry, and monitoring should greatly reduce the risk of earth tremor. High quality well casing and sealing of drilling fluids and gas production from surrounding aquifers is equally important, as is control of fugitive emissions. However, I expect the rollout of shale gas in the UK to be a lot slower than the Treasury hope for, and not to control the price of domestic gas supplies.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>M&oacute;nica Cristina, spokeswoman of <a href=\"http://www.shalegas-europe.eu/en/\">Shale Gas Europe</a>:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome unreservedly this momentous decision which has potential to create jobs and enhance energy security in Europe. While there continues to be intense speculation around risks, there is now substantial scientific evidence to support the UK government&rsquo;s decision. In June 2012 the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering concluded that the health, safety and environmental risks associated with the technique can be effectively managed. There are significant potential opportunities, as the British Geological Survey estimates UK shale gas resources maybe 50 per cent larger than conventional gas resources. Today&rsquo;s announcement follows the European Parliament&rsquo;s rejection of a Europe-wide moratorium on shale gas development on 21 November 2012. It highlights that the UK is ready to move forward with the sustainable development of its domestic natural gas resources following a thorough review of its impact. The UK now has the opportunity to further secure its gas supply, boost jobs and economic activity while reducing CO2 emissions when replacing higher carbon content fuels.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Andy Atkins, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Giving the green light to fracking for shale gas will send shock waves across the UK. Communities up and down the country will be disturbed by this reckless decision which threatens to contaminate our air and water and undermine national climate targets. George Osborne&rsquo;s short-sighted dash for gas will leave the country dependent on dirty fossil fuels &ndash; MPs must stand up for a safe and affordable future by insisting on clean British energy from the wind, waves and sun.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Ben Caldecott, head of policy, <a href=\"http://www.climatechangecapital.com/home.aspx\">Climate Change Capital</a>:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fracking will continue to generate significant local opposition, which will undermine long term political support and the investment case for a UK shale gas expansion. This is fortunate, as it's clear from the latest Committee on Climate Change findings that another dash for gas will expose us to higher and more volatile fuel prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c9acc3b579d49737370f0a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Before we start in earnest, here are the essential links that have been uploaded onto Decc's website this morning following Davey's announcement...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_shale/wms_shale.aspx\">Written Ministerial Statement by Edward Davey: Exploration for Shale Gas</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/oil_gas/shale_gas/shale_gas.aspx\">Update 13 Dec 2012 - New controls on seismic risks permit a resumption of shale gas exploration</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://og.decc.gov.uk/assets/og/ep/onshore/7269-government-response-sg-report-.pdf\">Government response to Royal Academy of Engineers and Royal Society report on &ldquo;Shale Gas Extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing&rdquo;</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://og.decc.gov.uk/assets/og/ep/onshore/7268-sg-qa.pdf\">Synopsis of main questions raised in responses to DECC consultation on mitigation of seismic risks from hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, with government responses</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50c99cf0b579d49737370eff\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T17:47:26.498Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ed-davey\">Ed Davey</a>, the energy secretary, has set out this morning why he is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas-green-light\">allowing the resumption of fracking</a> for shale gas in UK. <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_shale/wms_shale.aspx\">He said</a> that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/shale-gas\">fracking</a> - or hydraulic fracturing - can only resume with new safeguards to address the risk of seismic activity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having carefully reviewed the evidence with the aid of independent experts, and with the aid of an authoritative review of the scientific and engineering evidence on shale gas extraction conducted by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society, I have concluded that appropriate controls are available to mitigate the risks of undesirable seismic activity. Those new controls will be required by my Department for all future shale gas wells. On that basis, I am in principle prepared to consent to new fracking proposals for shale gas, where all other necessary permissions and consents are in place.</p> <p>This opens the way to a resumption of work on exploration for shale gas, though I stress the importance of the other regulatory consents, and planning permission, which are also necessary for these activities, and which must be in place before my Department will consider consent to individual operations. In practice, it will be well into next year before any new exploration work has all the necessary consents to proceed.

It has some concerns, though:</p><blockquote><p>A bright future for unconventional gas is far from assured: numerous hurdles need to be overcome, not least the social and environmental concerns associated with its extraction. Producing unconventional gas is an intensive industrial process, generally imposing a larger environmental footprint than conventional gas development. More wells are often needed and techniques such as hydraulic fracturing are usually required to boost the flow of gas from the well. The scale of development can have major implications for local communities, land use and water resources. Serious hazards, including the potential for air pollution and for contamination of surface and groundwater, must be successfully addressed. Greenhouse-gas emissions must be minimised both at the point of production and throughout the entire natural gas supply chain. Improperly addressed, these concerns threaten to curb, if not halt, the development of unconventional resources. The technologies and know-how exist for unconventional gas to be produced in a way that satisfactorily meets these challenges, but a continuous drive from governments and industry to improve performance is required if public confidence is to be maintained or earned.</p></blockquote><p>The IEA has developed a set of \"golden rules\" it believes will help the unconventional gas sector earn itself a \"social licence to operate\". Most of the rules focus on minimising any local environmental impacts, but what of the wider issue of the carbon emissions resulting from extracting and burning a fossil fuel such as gas?</p><p>Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, a major investor in the gas sector, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/29/shale-gas-coal-climate-investor\">said today</a> that the industry is not doing enough to tackle \"fugitive methane\" leaks which are currently cancelling out any carbon savings shale gas might offer over coal.</p><p>But what are your views? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.10pm:</span> <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF-UK</a> is quick out of the traps having already responded to the IEA report:</p><blockquote><p>The report explicitly points out that \"natural gas cannot on its own provide the answer to the challenge of climate change\". Responding, Keith Allott head of Climate Change at WWF-UK said:</p><p>\"A golden age for gas is clearly very far from a golden age for the planet. Buried in the depths of this report is the bombshell that a global dash for unconventional gas will condemn us to warming of at least 3.5C. Those who claim that shale gas is some sort of wonder fuel that can that tackle climate change are seriously misleading the public – the reality is that it is a dangerous distraction from energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. In a country like the UK it is important to recognise that there is not even a short term benefit to the availability of shale gas. Dirty coal was on its way out before shale gas turned up and the prospect of a dash for gas now appears to be the biggest threat to meeting UK carbon targets.\" </p><p>The IEA's report contains two scenarios entitled the 'Golden Rules Case' and 'Low Unconventional Gas'. In both scenarios the projection for long-term increase in the global mean temperature is significantly above 2C. Whilst emissions are very slightly lower in the IEA's Golden Rules Case', the IEA point out that any gains from replacement of coal with gas are counteracted by higher demand and less investment in low carbon fuels:</p><p>\"At the global level, there are two major effects of the Golden Rules Case on CO2 emissions, which counteract one another. Lower natural gas prices mean that, in some instances, gas displaces the use of more carbon-intensive fuels, oil and coal, pushing down emissions. At the same time, lower natural gas prices lead to slightly higher overall consumption of energy and, in some instances, to displacement of lower-carbon fuels, such as renewable energy sources and nuclear power. Overall, the projections in the Golden Rules Case involve only a small net shift in anticipated levels of greenhouse-gas emissions.\"</p></blockquote><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.18pm:</span> Earlier this week, the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9290026/Fracking-is-not-the-answer-to-energy-crisis-UK-Minister-admits-as-he-orders-shale-gas-survey.html\">Daily Telegraph reported</a> that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ed-davey\">Ed Davey</a>, the UK's energy and climate secretary, had \"accused those on the right of the Tory party of making out the UK could rely on shale gas in order to undermine investment in alternatives such as offshore wind\":</p><blockquote><p>\"The right wing of tory party are trying to make out shale gas is the answer but I'm afraid the evidence does not bear it out,\" he said.<br />However, he did make clear that shale gas could still be useful to the UK, providing up to 10 per cent of energy needs, and is expected to give fracking the go-ahead in the next few weeks following a consultation which has just ended. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.25pm:</span> Here are the thoughts of Tony Bosworth, <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>'s energy campaigner:</p><blockquote><p>Drilling for shale and other unconventional gas would put the world on course for catastrophic climate change - incomprehensible when we have clean energy solutions at our fingertips like wind and solar power. Our changing climate is already leaving millions hungry, destroying wildlife and costing our own economy billions - more fossil fuels will just make that worse. There's no guarantee the IEA's golden rules will eliminate the risk of earthquakes and water pollution - no wonder people are worried. The energy secretary knows shale gas is not the answer to our energy woes. He must convince the government to cut energy waste and listen to the public who want more of their electricity to be powered by our sun, wind and water.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.56pm:</span> Last year, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/22/chris-huhne-lawson-think-tank?intcmp=239\">Lord Lawson's climate sceptic thinktank</a> which routinely highlights the merits of shale gas, <a href=\"http://thegwpf.org/press-releases/2938-new-report-shale-gas-shock-challenges-climate-and-energy-policies.html\">asked Matt Ridley</a> to examine the \"likely implications\" a shale gas \"revolution\" would have on international climate policy. Ridley concluded (<a href=\"http://thegwpf.org/images/stories/gwpf-reports/Shale-Gas_4_May_11.pdf\">pdf</a>):</p><blockquote><p>Few of the low-carbon alternatives are ready to take up the challenge on a scale that can make a difference. Nuclear is too slow and costly to build; wind cannot provide sufficient volume of power or reliability; solar is too expensive; biofuel comes at the expense of hunger and high carbon dioxide emissions. All except nuclear (and to a lesser extent solar) require unacceptably vast land grabs...However, switching as much power generation from coal to gas as possible, and as much transport fuel from oil to gas as possible, would produce rapid and dramatic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions...If Europe and the wider world are bent on cutting carbon emissions, they would be foolish to ignore the claims of shale gas, at least until superior versions of nuclear or solar power are developed later in the century. Fortunately, this strategy is also the most affordable.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.12pm:</span> Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16356654\">@TimProbert</a> below the line for linking to his \"<a href=\"http://millicentmedia.com/2012/05/29/top-ten-takeaways-from-uk-shale-gas-summit/\">Top ten takeaways</a>\" from the recent <a href=\"http://www.smi-online.co.uk/event_media/overview.asp?is=5&amp;ref=3947\">SMi Shale Gas Environmental Summit</a> in London. It's certainly worth a read. I found point 7 particularly interesting:</p><blockquote><p>7. Fugitive methane emissions are estimated at 4%, which could make shale gas more environmentally damaging than coal, says UCL energy professor</p><p>Studies suggest fugitive emissions may total 4% of total gas captured from fracking, higher than conventional gas, says UCL's Paul Ekins. \"You only need fugitive emissions of 3-9% for gas to be equivalent to emissions from coal in power stations. Unless you can be very sure that these fugitive emissions won't occur then the carbon benefits of substituting coal generation with gas might be seriously undermined.\"</p></blockquote><p>I have tried to reach <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/people/?school=energy&amp;upi=PEKIN72\">Prof Ekins</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy\">UCL Energy Institute</a> for further comment, but he is currently away.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.20pm:</span> Jim Footner, head of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace UK</a>'s climate and energy campaign, says:</p><blockquote><p>This report admits that gambling on gas will drive up bills and send climate change out of control. Studies have shown that shale gas can be worse for the climate than coal, and this report offers no proven solutions. As the IEA itself admits, the only way to tackle climate change is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. This would also cut our reliance on all forms of gas and so stabilise bills.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.43pm:</span> For me, this is the key part of the IEA report (page 91 of the <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/goldenrules/WEO2012_GoldenRulesReport.pdf\">pdf</a>) when it comes to discussing how a \"dash for gas\" would impact on greenhouse gas emissions. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/29/shale-gas-fracking-green-carbon#block-2\">WWF has also spotted</a>, it seems to accept a temperature rise of more than 3.5C in the long term - without carbon capture and storage. (A very big \"if\", as the technology currently stands.) It also makes the important point that a dash for gas in Europe might not lead to significant carbon savings, if any, but in places such as China, where coal is king, a switch to gas could have a \"substantial\" impact on CO2 emissions:</p><blockquote><p>The Golden Rules Case puts CO2 emissions on a long-term trajectory consistent with stabilising the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions at around 650 parts per million, a trajectory consistent with a probable temperature rise of more than 3.5 degrees Celsius (°C) in the long term, well above the widely accepted 2°C target. This finding reinforces a central conclusion from the WEO special report on a Golden Age of Gas (IEA, 2011b), that, while a greater role for natural gas in the global energy mix does bring environmental benefits where it substitutes for other fossil fuels, natural gas cannot on its own provide the answer to the challenge of climate change. This conclusion could be changed by widespread application of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, which could reduce considerably the emissions from the consumption of gas (and other fossil fuels); but this is not assumed in the period to 2035. At country level, the impact of the Golden Rules Case on greenhouse-gas emissions from gas depends to a large degree on the structure of domestic fuel use, in particular for power generation. In countries where the average greenhouse-gas intensity of power generation is already close to that of natural gas, as for example in Europe, the addition of extra natural gas to the fuel mix has relatively little impact on the overall emissions trajectory. By contrast, in countries heavily reliant upon coal for electricity generation, such as China, the increased availability of natural gas has a more substantial impact on CO2 emissions. Such increased use of gas also reduces emissions of other pollutants; compared with burning coal, combustion of natural gas results in lower emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and<br />gas also emits almost no particulate matter. Local emissions of particulate matter and NOX are the main causes of low air quality – a particularly important consideration for emerging economies seeking to provide energy for fast-growing urban areas.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.44pm:</span> </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leohickman\">leohickman</a> Following your live blog.

However, with other policies in place, gas in general, and shale gas in particular, can have a role as a transitional fuel that is consistent with required emissions reductions. To ensure that this occurs, Policy Exchange recently called on the EU to extend its emissions cap through to at least 2035. This would give long term certainty to investors, allowing the market to decide which technology has the most potential to deliver emission reductions at the cheapest cost.<br />If due to shale or other technological developments, gas prices are lower than previously anticipated, using gas rather than more expensive alternatives to generate electricity would free up resources. Carbon emissions from electricity, capped by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, would be the same under either approach. This could allow governments to be more ambitious about carbon reduction, or invest in effective low carbon innovation support – research, development and demonstration, and early stage deployment of a range of low carbon technologies with global potential.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.55pm:</span> Carbon Brief, a \"project of the Energy Strategy Centre\", which \"fact-checks stories about climate and energy\", has produced a <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/05/qa-on-fugitive-emissions-from-fracking\">timely Q&amp;A</a> on \"fugitive emissions\" released by the extraction of shale gas.

Therefore, emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK Government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen Accord and Low Carbon Transition Plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel. Moreover, any significant and early development of the industry is likely to prove either economically unwise or risk jeopardising the UK's international reputation on climate change. Against such a quantifiable and stark evaluation, it is difficult to conclude other than the UK needs to invest in very low carbon energy supply if it is to both abide by its international obligations and support economically sustainable technologies.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.27pm:</span> Craig Mackenzie, head of sustainability at <a href=\"http://www.swip.com/pages/default.aspx\">Scottish Widows Investment Partnership</a> (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/29/shale-gas-fracking-green-carbon#block-1\">see 12.59pm</a>), has sent me this:</p><blockquote><p>My statistic of the year so far is the fact that coal power generation in the US has fallen by 19% and gas power generation is up by 38% (US Energy Information Administration). Cheap and abundant shale gas, with the helping hand of new air pollution standards is shutting down coal in the US - and doing so extremely quickly. The switch in one year is roughly the same size as the total US wind generation. If this keeps happening, and if the gas industry deals with the fugitive methane problem which SWIP identified in our recent report (<a href=\"http://www.swip.com/sites/docs/SiteCollectionDocuments/SWIP%20Document%20Test%20Folder/May-2012-Sustainability-Research-Note.pdf\">pdf</a>), then shale gas could bring a substantial short-term climate benefit.<br />Even more interesting, it is possible that the coal-gas switch could start to happen in China - host to the world's biggest shale gas resource - where 80% of electric power comes from coal generation. This could have an even bigger climate benefit.<br />While it would be best for the climate if the world did a switch direct from coal to zero carbon power. We need to ask how likely this is - given the costs and the politics. If we cannot have this ideal scenario, then temporary coal-gas switching could be better for the climate than the alternative: keeping burning coal.<br />While a coal-gas switch might be a pragmatic short-term option in the<br />US and maybe China (the world's two biggest carbon emitters), this doesn't mean that shale gas makes climate sense everywhere. In the EU - given political support for strong climate policy - we should be discussing how we start to phase out of gas (or add CCS), not how we ramp up long-term production.<br />Even in the US and China we need to be careful - while a coal-gas switch makes climate sense a wind-gas switch certainly doesn't. And without ongoing subsidy - or preferably carbon taxes - there is a risk that this is what we will get. Also, even in the US and China, we need to switch the gas off (or attach CCS) within a couple of decades or so. So we need to start planning for this.<br />But. If it is true - as the new US data seems to indicate - that gas can topple king coal faster than any alternative currently available, then this is a climate benefit worth having - if only for a decade or two.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.46pm:</span> Earlier, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/29/shale-gas-fracking-green-carbon#block-6\">I mentioned</a> that I had unsuccessfully tried to reach Prof Ekins at the UCL Energy Institute. However, <a href=\"http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy/people/students/christophe-mcglade\">Christophe McGlade</a>, one of his PhD students, has responded. </p><blockquote><p>The range of 3-9% [for fugitive emissions] is quite large and critically depends on the global warming potential (GWP) assumed for methane. The IEA has a nice representation of this in figure 1.5 on page 40 of its report.  Some groups have argued for a GWP factor of 25 (the GWP of methane over a 100 year time frame) and others a factor closer to 100 (over a 20 year time frame). Proponents of the shorter time frame argue that it is the next 20 years that will be crucial for tackling climate change.<br />There is also a large debate raging over the fugitive emissions of shale gas production stimulated by recent papers from <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/c338g7j559580172/\">Howarth et al. at Cornell</a>. The first of these papers met with a lot of criticism from industry and a variety of other groups carried out their own review (such as <a href=\"http://www.longfinance.net/programmes/london-accord.html?id=407\">Deutsche Bank</a>). Another recent, independent, report on gas emissions was released by the NOAA in a paper in Nature (<a href=\"http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2012/02/Petron_Colorado_Front_Range_2011.pdf\">http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2012/02/Petron_Colorado_Front_Range_2011.pdf</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/air-sampling-reveals-high-emissions-from-gas-field-1.9982\">http://www.nature.com/news/air-sampling-reveals-high-emissions-from-gas-field-1.9982</a>) which also suggested a figure of around 4% methane being released. Given the levels of criticism of Howarth et al. this was a surprising new piece of research and puts gas production onto a similar footing as coal. There is an urgent need into more (unpartisan) studies into this area.<br />In the UK, just as important as fugitive emissions however is the long term implications of tying into a (shale) gas filled future. In order to have any hope of reaching the legally binding climate change targets, a carbon neutral electricity system is essential. A quick back of the envelope calculations suggests that immediately switching all UK coal power plants to gas will save around 58 million tonnes CO2, not a small amount, but only around 23% of the required reductions needed in energy system CO2 levels by 2030 and only 12% of the required 2050 reductions.<br />The technical aspects of carbon capture and storage (CCS) mean that gas with CCS cannot be used as back up to renewables and so if gas is to play any part of the future electricity system, it can either be as gas with CCS or, burning unabated, as simple back up to renewables. If the latter of these, then the number of gas power plants required will be a lot lower or those that have been constructed will have to run at very low capacity levels. Some of the research we have done here as part of the UK Energy Research Centre using the MARKAL energy systems suggests that gas can have a part to play in a future decarbonised electricity system, but any unabated gas will only be able to run 10% of the time. This is the danger in rushing into another dash for gas.<br />This is not to say that gas use will not be useful in other regions as any increases in gas supply in regions like China could lead to potential new coal plants being switched to gas plants. Shale gas could therefore be useful for helping to meet climate targets in regions such as these, but probably not in the UK.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.07pm:</span> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/damiancarrington\">Damian Carrington</a>, the Guardian's head of environment, reminds me that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/03/shale-gas-game-changer-fracking\">Deutsche Bank published another report last year</a> (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/29/shale-gas-fracking-green-carbon#block-16\">see 3.46pm</a>) that poured cold water over the idea the the UK will see a shale gas revolution, as witnessed in the US. Not least, because of the tougher planning and environmental regulations that come from living on a densely populated island.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.12pm:</span> Fiona Harvey's news story about the IEA report will soon be live on the Guardian website. Here's a teaser:</p><blockquote><p>On current trends, according to the IEA, the world is set for far more global warming than the 2C that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. \"A golden age for gas is not necessarily a golden age for the climate,\" warned [Fatih Birol, chief economist for the IEA]...<br />Gas produces only about half of the carbon emissions of coal when burnt, which has led some industry lobbyists to attempt to rebrand it as a \"clean\" or \"low-carbon\" fuel. But its effect on the climate is less clear cut than the direct comparison with coal would suggest. <br />In the US, gas-fired power stations have taken over in some areas from coal-fired power, which reduced the nominal carbon emissions from US power stations. But that does not necessarily equate to a global cut in emissions. Last year, the consumption of coal in Europe rose by 6%, according to Birol, which was a result of an excess of cheap coal on the market because of less consumption in the US, while the price on carbon emissions under the EU's emissions trading scheme – supposed to discourage coal – was too low to have any effect. That rise in coal consumption will have increased emissions in the EU, though the data has not yet been fully collected.<br />This example shows that gas can simply displace emissions rather than cut them altogether, according to Birol. \"Gas cannot solve climate change – we need renewable energy,\" he told the Guardian.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.43pm:</span> </p><h2>My verdict</h2><p> There's no hiding from the fact that shale gas is a fossil fuel. Both the extraction process, and the burning of it as a fuel, emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But there is some logic - albeit garlanded with caveats - that replacing coal and oil with shale gas could lead to a significant reduction in overall emissions. This is currently the story coming out of the US, where the shale gas revolution is well under way. And in fast-developing countries such as China, where coal is king, a direct transfer to gas would be a very<br />positive development. Shale gas certainly has potential as a \"bridging fuel\", buying us perhaps a couple more decades to work out - both technically and politically - a viable way to genuinely and rapidly decarbonise the global economy.</p><p>However, those pesky caveats can't be suppressed for long. The principal danger is that a \"dash for gas\" will suck investment and momentum away from the fledgling renewables sector. Cheap, abundant gas might also trigger the \"rebound effect\" - people will likely just burn more of the stuff, thereby quickly cancelling out any carbon savings. There also seems to be far too much confidence that carbon capture and storage will ride in to save the day, when the technology is still a very long way off from being proven.</p><p>As will be the case with minimising shale gas's localised environmental impacts, such as water pollution and earth tremors, politicians and regulators will need to be strong-willed and beady-eyed if they are to ensure it delivers any genuine environmental benefits.</p>","headline":"How green is shale gas?","trailText":"<p>The rise of 'fracking' means the IEA is hailing a 'golden age for gas'.

EJF is dismayed that, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the threats posed by neonicotinoids and recommendations from the EU's own&nbsp;Food Safety Authority, the EU member states rejected the proposal to restrict their use. Such restrictions would have signified a landmark decision by European governments to stand up for nature and biodiversity in the face of pressure from pesticide manufacturers.

However, in their role as pollinators of wild flowers and other flowering plants, bees play an even more important, albeit less quantifiable, role as keystone indicator species. In short, their ecological value to our planet's biodiversity is immeasurable.&nbsp;<br />Given the importance of bees, both economically and ecologically, I cannot understand our government's stance on neonicotinoids. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that this group of pesticides is contributing to bee decline - and if I had anything to do with the decision making I certainly wouldn't be waiting for 'unequivocal scientific evidence' to this effect before invoking the precautionary principle. There is too much at stake!<br />We cannot afford to wait for the results of further research. We need to act now by banning neonicotinoids, reducing pesticide use in general and mobilising the nation to plant millions of acres of pollen and nectar rich flowers. A world without bees is unimaginable, but if we DO succeed in getting it right for bees, we get it right for all life on earth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142ff03b5799f28f712f6e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the thoughts of Paul de Zylva, Friends of the Earth's \"<a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/what_we_do/bee_cause_david_cameron_petition_39395.html?utm_expid=4681116-13\">Bee Cause</a>\" campaigner:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bees contribute over &pound;500 million a year to the economy just by doing what they do naturally - pollinating crops. To replace this free service would cost at least &pound;1.8bn (<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/beesreport.pdf\">pdf</a>). Farmers would need to collect pollen and pollinate by hand. That cost will show up in food prices. This figure puts a hard economic value on the benefits they provide.</p> <p>But bees pollinate bluebells, lime trees, hawthorn and many more of the flowers and plants that enrich our natural world and lives - so &pound;1.8bn is at once a fairly reasonable estimate on the worth of one part of what they provide and a laughable indictment of the way we seek to put a price on something whose value is intrinsic, irreplaceable and probably priceless.</p> <p>So if we allow bee numbers to decline further - due to pesticides, loss of habitat, poorly planned developments, and lack of people actually examining what's going on with pollinators - then it will have a cost to our economy, but our whole world will be poorer.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is huge public interest and concern about the plight of our bees, not just honey bees. Leading home and garden retailers have already removed pesticide linked to bee decline. Minsters must stop dithering on this crucial issue and take action too. They should back European Commission proposals to restrict neonicotinoid pesticides &ndash; and introduce a Bee Action Plan to tackle all the threats bees face.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142fd7fb5799f28f712f6df\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Luke Gibbs, a spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/Pages/home.aspx\">Syngenta</a>, which manufactures a neonic called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamethoxam\">Thiamethoxam</a>, has sent me this statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>Syngenta strongly agrees that bees play an enormously important role in agriculture and are critical for life. But we do not believe that neonicotinoid pesticides are playing a role in bee population decline.</p> <p>Whilst we recognize that this issue is both emotive and often divisive, those who want to blame pesticide companies miss a powerful truth: our business depends upon healthy ecosystems and biodiversity. We advise farmers year after year about good agronomic practice and stewardship of their land - for example see our Operation Pollinator project &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.operationpollinator.com\">www.operationpollinator.com</a> &ndash; now in its tenth year. Damaging farmland by reducing biodiversity and harming ecosystems would simply be bad business for farmers and for us.</p> <p>Through all the mounting fury of the claims about bees and pesticides there is no hard evidence from the field which shows that neonicotinoids damage bee health, or that banning them will improve things for bees. In fact the only evidence against these pesticides is completely theoretical and based on incorrect assumptions about what might happen in the field. If we applied a similar approach to managing risk in our everyday lives it&rsquo;s doubtful any of us would leave the house for fear of what might happen.</p> <p>In contrast, there is plenty of evidence from independent field studies and monitoring, much of it undertaken by governments in Europe and around the world, that proves these pesticides can be, and are, used safely without damaging bee health. Much of this research has been described as &lsquo;best in class&rsquo; but because of the narrow mandate set for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) bee review by the European Commission the authority did not take it into account in its recent assessment. For these reasons we believe EFSA&rsquo;s assessment to be incomplete and not a sound basis for the European Commission to propose action.</p> <p>Interestingly, the European Commission also seems to believe that pesticides are unlikely to play a role in bee decline. In data presented in recent weeks by lead officials from DG SANCO to a group in the European Parliament it was highlighted that beekeepers identified at least eight factors relating to bee and colony health that they considered more significant than pesticides, including disease, viruses and loss of habitat. In addition, the data presented also highlighted that a number of laboratories surveyed by the European Commission had also indicated that pesticides play a negligible role in bee decline.</p> <p>Those who focus on banning neonicotinoids create the impression that this will solve the bee health problem. It will not. There is now a real danger of polarizing the debate to such an extent that we will fail to bring together all the knowledge and expertise we need to solve this problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's a video recently produced by Syngenta examining, what it believes, would be the consequences of a neonic ban...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNyJ3qaebgg\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kNyJ3qaebgg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In addition, here's a recent interview Syngenta recorded with John Atkin, its chief operating officer, in which he blames the decline of bees squarely on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor\">varroa mite</a>...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJHZsqSJku4\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CJHZsqSJku4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142fbbc95cb3037f5c827db\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.sbes.stir.ac.uk/people/goulson/\">David Goulson</a>, a professor of biological sciences and bee expert at the University of Stirling's <a href=\"http://www.sbes.stir.ac.uk/\">Institute of Biological &amp; Environmental Sciences</a>, has sent me this comment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bees pollinate about 1,500 different crops worldwide, including most fruit and vegetables; imagine a world without apples, strawberries, blueberries, runner beans, courgettes, tomatoes and many, many more.

The majority of plants worldwide are pollinated by bees, so natural ecosystems from the flower-rich chalk downland of England to the rainforests of the Amazon depend on them.

More than half of the world&rsquo;s diet of fat and oil comes from oilseeds such as cotton, rape, sunflower, coconut, groundnut and oil palm. Even though some of these have special pollinators belonging to other types of insects, these plants all depend on, or benefit from bee pollination to some extent. In addition, many food crops and forage for cattle are grown from seeds of insect-pollinated plants. The great value of bees as pollinators has been known for many years, but unfortunately, this knowledge is not widely appreciated and understood.<br />The value of bee pollination in Western Europe is estimated to be 30-50 times the value of honey and wax harvests in this region. In Africa, bee pollination is sometimes estimated to be 100 times the value of the honey harvest, depending on the type of crop.<br />In a country like Denmark, about 3,000 tonnes of honey is harvested every year. It has a value of 60 million DKK or about &euro;7.6 million. However, the value of oilseeds, fruits and berries created by the pollination work of bees is estimated to be between 1,600 and 3,000 million DKK, equivalent to &euro;200 and &euro;400 million.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142f5ec95cb3037f5c827d6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a recent TEDx lecture by <a href=\"http://www.hannahnordhaus.com/\">Hannah Nordhaus</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.hannahnordhaus.com/book/\">The Beekeeper's Lament: How One Man and Half a Billion Honey Bees Help Feed America</a>...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Wachq3IQo\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/X9Wachq3IQo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142f4fcb5799f28f712f6da\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a joint statement from Steve Trent, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.ejfoundation.org/bees\">Environmental Justice Foundation</a> (EJF), and Keith Tyrell, director of the <a href=\"http://www.pan-uk.org/\">Pesticide Action Network UK</a> (PAN UK):</p> <blockquote> <p>Since the use of neonicotinoid pesticides exploded, bee populations have been declining at an alarming rate. Neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used pesticides in the world. They are systemic so the poison travels into pollen and nectar, and each time a bee makes contact with contaminated pollen it receives a dose of neurotoxin hundreds of times more toxic than any other insecticide on the market. Repeated doses affect bee behaviour and can have catastrophic effects on bee colonies.</p> <p>Despite growing scientific evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides are contributing to the decline in bee populations, the pesticide industry has succeeded in sowing confusion and uncertainty. Scaremongering tactics have been deployed, suggesting potential economic losses if these substances are banned. Bees and other insect pollinators play a vital role in food security and livelihoods, as well as being an integral part of natural ecosystems. The costs of losing them would far outweigh the price of altering farming to avoid the most dangerous uses of neonicotinoids.</p> <p>Today&rsquo;s European vote to potentially restrict the use of neonicotinoid pesticides represents a major opportunity to protect the UK&rsquo;s invaluable pollinators. It is a moment for real and meaningful action to be taken to halt the worrying decline in bee populations, which has far-reaching consequences for the UK&rsquo;s environment and economy. It is vital that the UK government supports the measures being proposed and does not choose to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence of the threat these chemicals pose.</p> <p>EJF and PAN UK are campaigning together to end the use of neonicotinoids. We are encouraging the government to adopt a Pollinator Action Plan to protect all bees and pollinators. We hope through raising awareness of the intrinsic value of bees and pollinators, we can promote positive public action to save them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142f30db5799f28f712f6d8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dr Julian Little, who works on Bayer's \"<a href=\"http://beecare.bayer.com/the-bayer-beecare-program.html\">Bee Care Program</a>\" (Bayer is one of the leading manufacturers of neonics), has sent me his response to the question of placing a valuation on bees:</p> <blockquote> <p>Talking to beekeepers, both amateur and professional, and bee scientists, it is clear that the value of bees is many and varied. Bayer has been a bee care company for over 25 years finding new solutions to treat the real cause of poor bee health, namely the Varroa mite. This nasty parasite not only sucks the blood out of the bee, but also injects a wide variety of viruses, the result of which can reduce the life of a bee by up to 50%. We know if we deal with this problem, you end up with healthy bees from the experience of Australia. Despite an agricultural system similar to that of the UK, including the widespread use of systemic insecticides, Australia has the healthiest bees on the planet, to the point where Australian bees are exported widely, especially to the US - the reason for this is clear: the Varroa mite has yet to reach its shores. <br /> In addition to their role in the production of honey, the value of bees is of course as important pollinators. Whilst their&nbsp;importance&nbsp;relative to other pollinating insects, such as bumble bees and solitary bees, is the subject of much discussion, they are very effective in situations where insect pollination is required - in the case of orchards, for example, and their value in almond and citrus production is extremely valuable and beekeepers and their bees command a large premium in the US. <br /> They are also very important in situations where normal pollination does not happen, for example, in the production of hybrid crops. Bayer CropScience is THE major user of commercial bee hives in Canada, in the production of hybrid oilseed rape, or canola. We simply could not be the major supplier of high quality seeds to farmers without the help of beekeepers and the health of their bees is extremely important to us. <br /> Of course, we are sensitive to concerns around the use of specific insecticides, the neonicotinoids, and we recognise that those concerns have to be addressed. Nevertheless, these products have a long history of safe use in the UK. They are used to coat crop seeds such that pests do not eat the crop as it germinates and in the early stages of seedling growth. Our concern is that the loss of such seed treatments would not stop farmers having to control the pests and the diseases that they spread, if they want to produce high quality affordable food. In the absence of neonicotinoid seed treatments, farmers would have to apply more foliar sprays, more often; is that what environmentalists really want? <br /> Bayer will continue to search for treatments for Varroa control - we think that that will have a significant positive impact on bees; blaming the nearest chemical will not. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142f00195cb3037f5c827ce\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association</a>, has sent me this statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>Honey bees and the often forgotten massive number of wild pollinators have huge value to us and the functioning of the natural environment. It is estimated that pollinating insects add some &pound;430m to the British economy by pollinating crops. Yet, as has been widely publicised, they are in trouble. One of the major culprits has been found to be the neonicotinoid pesticide group of systemic insecticides. The evidence is so strong that European member states are set to vote on whether to temporarily ban a number of them today. We are dismayed that the UK government is planning to vote against this ban and we and others have been strongly urging them to rethink their position.</p> <p>So what else can be done to protect pollinators? A synthesis of 39 studies on 23 crops around the world <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12082/abstract\">published earlier this week</a> in the journal<em> Ecology Letters</em> confirms that wild bees are more abundant in diversified systems such as organic farms. Organic farmers are already proving that it's perfectly possible to farm without using harmful systemic insecticides like neonicotinoids. It seems almost too obvious to mention, but perhaps worth a reminder that we can all help value bees by supporting organic farmers and choosing to eat organic food.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142eef3b5799f28f712f6d3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple of weeks ago the Guardian&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/03/pesticides-ban-editorial\">published an editorial</a> on the subject of bees and neonics:</p> <blockquote> <p>The manufacturers, claiming commercial confidentiality, are reluctant to share details of formula, concentration and data from regulatory trials. But <a href=\"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/Pages/home.aspx\">Syngenta</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bayer.co.uk/scripts/pages/en/index.php\">Bayer</a> recently assured MPs on the environmental audit committee that a ban would do more harm than good because it would mean more spraying. Their claim is that neonicotinoids, even if they are implicated, are not the biggest cause of decline in pollinator populations. They point not just to the lethal <a href=\"http://www.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef608.asp\">varroa mite</a> but to the loss and quality of habitat. Independent scientists disagree. They believe that, even at low levels, the chemicals cause neurological damage to insects, undermining their resilience and leaving them less likely to breed successfully. In the interests of conservation, scientists told <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/c668-iii/c66801.htm\">the same committee</a> that neonicotinoids should be, if not banned, then at least restricted...</p> <p>British <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/farming\">farming</a> and environment ministers prefer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/mar/01/bees-pesticide-neonicotinoids\">the status quo</a>. They look like getting left behind: already some garden centres are withdrawing neonicotinoid-based pesticides. The science may not yet be conclusive.

My bees could easily starve during this cold spell, for example. So it is disingenuous for campaign groups to promise concerned citizens that they could save bees from extinction if they help to ban neonics. Nevertheless, the scientific consensus is that unusually large bee losses are caused by a combination of parasites, poor nutrition and pesticides. If we eliminate one of the assailants across Europe it won't be a panacea. Any ban would have to go hand in hand with improving varroa control, addressing the junk food diet that monoculture agriculture delivers bees, and reintroduction of hedgerows and wildflowers to provide habitat and food for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/feb/28/wild-bees-pollinators-crop-yields\">wild bees</a>. But if we are prepared to do that, then let's bring in a precautionary two-year ban until the correct tests are done to prove once and for all the harm, or not, that neonics are causing our precious bee colonies.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142eba395cb3037f5c827cc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/boris.baer\">Prof Boris Baer</a>, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/\">Centre for Integrative Bee Research</a> at the University of Western Australia, has sent me his thoughts on the \"value of bees\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Bees have always played an important role for humans, as the social lifestyle of many bees inspired men and women to reflect on our own societies and influenced philosophical and political thinkers in their search to define the individuals rights and obligations within a society. However, as we all know, there were also more pragmatic reasons to look for bees. They provided important products such as honey or wax. At some point in history, humans became fully aware of the most important good they get from bees, pollination. Or in short: Bees = food. As a consequence, humans started to keep a number of bee species and domesticated them &ndash; and one species, the European honeybee eventually joined the settlers when conquering the world.</p> <p>Today, more than 80 crops of agricultural interest depend on bee pollination or about a third of what you eat requires a bee pollination event. However, industrialisation within the agricultural sector has brought dramatic changes for bees. Beekeeping has become a large-scale business, some Apiarists keep thousands to tens of thousands of colonies and earn money by renting them to farmers that need crop pollination. For this, bees need to be transported over thousands of kilometers and are confronted with new and rather hostile environments: Crop monocultures that need heavy protection through pesticides to ensure maximal harvest. Our growing global population of humans struggles to produce sufficient amounts of food under increasingly more difficult conditions such as global climate change.</p> <p>Is it surprising then that we are loosing bees as pollinators? Probably not, but a full awareness of their decline, value and importance for food production and ecosystem stability is just beginning to emerge, and becomes increasingly more recognized beyond beekeeper and academic borders. The horror of what could await us is nicely pictured in a recent movie &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/?page_id=121\">More than Honey</a>&rdquo; where trees in some regions of China need to be hand pollinated after the disappearance of bee pollinators. What we need is the recognition that bees cannot be treated as another industrially produced commodity. As such they might teach us another critical lesson: That there are indeed <em>Limits of Growth</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Baer also sent me his thoughts on placing a financial value on bees:</p> <blockquote> <p>Putting dollar values on goods and services is unfortunately the main driver of decision makers these days. Whether they make sense or can be accurately calculated is questionable, but I don't think we have any choice really. I actually had several discussions with people from economics how to calculate an appropriate pollination value, because, here in Australia, bees and pollination services are still a public good (i.e. there are a lot of feral bees around). Consequently this is given for granted and consequently is not a considered as a cost variable by stake holders.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5142e6f495cb3037f5c827c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T18:04:13.571Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Eco Audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today, European officials are set to vote on a proposal that would see a group of insecticides known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid\">neonicotinoids,</a> which have been implicated in the decline of bees, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/31/eu-proposes-ban-insecticides-bee\">largely outlawed across the continent</a>.</p> <p>The move would be <a href=\"http://www.avaaz.org/en/hours_to_save_the_bees/?slideshow\">warmly welcomed by environmentalists</a> who have long argued that \"neonics\" should be banned.
