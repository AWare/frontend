In the 1970s, a collection of designs was discovered behind the organ of All Saints church in Windsor, many of which featured the work of Hardy. Although three of the drawings were kept in the church, until Stuart Tunstall and his fellow churchgoer Don Church embarked on a search for the building’s foundation stone, it was believed that none of the designs had been realised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7ab8f7193e32bae87d3c3fa12f779b0eddf36275\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab8f7193e32bae87d3c3fa12f779b0eddf36275/0_0_2592_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"First pillar, discovered behind the walls of All Saints Church in Windsor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first pillar of the Hardy reredos, illuminated behind panelling by torchlight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Tunstall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I said, ‘Let’s have a root around with a torch’, and he said, ‘I’ve always wondered why the panelling behind the altar sticks out a bit’,” said Tunstall. “I lay down, and shone my iPhone torch up the back. I didn’t see a foundation stone, but I saw a carved motive and a decorative panel.”</p> <p>Tunstall realised the design on the altar-stone resembled a design hanging at the back of the church – the one, he said, that had been designed by Hardy. “The discovery shows it did exist, but that it had been covered over some time in the 1920s,” he said. “It’s every little boy and little girl’s dream, to discover hidden treasure.”</p> <p>Tunstall gave a presentation about the finding to the Thomas Hardy Society’s conference earlier this month. “They were extremely excited,” he said. “It appears to be completely undamaged and there’s absolutely no doubt about the designs [being Hardy’s work]. The only issue I needed to be clear about was if Hardy came up with the designs himself or if he, as a gothic draughtsman, was drawing what others had instructed him to draw. But the view of the experts is that he was involved in designing it.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://campaign.justgiving.com/charity/new-windsorpcc/thomashardyaltarpiece\">All Saints is now looking to raise £9,000</a> in order to take away the panelling and restore the altarpiece. The church called the ornamental fixture – known as a reredos – magnificent, and said in its JustGiving appeal that “once made visible again, the Hardy reredos will be of great interest to the thousands of Hardy devotees around the world, will put our church on the tourist map of Windsor, and will restore this outstanding example of Victorian gothic religious art to the sight of all who worship at or use this fine building”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/thomas-hardy-tess-of-the-durbervilles-bones-found-at-prison\">Bones found at prison may belong to real-life Tess of the d'Urbervilles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The church’s rector, Reverend Ainsley Swift, said: “It’s got to be done really carefully – the wooden panelling is from the 1920s and 30s and has some fine woodwork detail on it, so we’re not allowed to just rip it out. But the joiners have managed to remove certain panels and it looks very impressive … I’ve been here for 18 years and nobody knew it existed.”</p>","wordcount":"512","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-22T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v3n8","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb7430021d33aafd4ad85e754f74705955fe750/108_793_2154_1292/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/thomashardy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Thomas Hardy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomashardy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/thomashardy","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/architecture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Architecture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/architecture","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Art and design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/design","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/design","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/design","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alison Flood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"flood"}],"elements":[{"id":"eeb7430021d33aafd4ad85e754f74705955fe750","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb7430021d33aafd4ad85e754f74705955fe750/0_336_2448_2448/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Thomas Hardy’s altarpiece design for All Saints church in Windsor.","caption":"Rood the obscure ...

I still consider myself an activist,” he says. “I tell people all the time if you see something that is not fair, not right, and not just, then you have a moral obligation to do something about it – to get in the way, to get in trouble.”</p> <p>Most recently, Lewis got in the way during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/house-democrats-stage-sit-vote-gun-control\">a June sit-in to protest congressional inaction on gun control</a> after the mass shooting that left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">49 dead in an Orlando nightclub</a>. That time, the protest ended without confrontation. For Lewis, that makes it an outlier. The 75-year-old has been arrested more than 40 times in is life, and five times since he was elected to Congress nearly 30 years ago. Lewis added with pride: “I’ll probably get arrested again.”</p> <p>Many of those arrests are depicted in the more than 500 pages of illustrated civil rights history depicted in March, which released its final instalment earlier this month. Book three picks up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/mar/07/sarah-collins-rudolph-birmingham-bombing-video\">the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church</a> in Birmingham in 1963, and ends with the 1965 signing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/29/civil-rights-act-us-politics-democrats-south\">the Civil Rights Act</a> by President Lyndon Johnson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2015/dec/01/rosa-parks-60th-anniversary-bus-seat-civil-rights-pictures\">Rosa Parks: 60th anniversary of a historic day in Alabama – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The series, first released in 2013, covers virtually every major civil rights moment of the 1950s and 1960s, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/31/rosa-parks-100-american-rebel-justice\">Rosa Parks’ arrest</a> on a Montgomery city bus to the 1965 Bloody Sunday attack by police and deputized white civilians on protesters in Selma. That episode left Lewis with scars on his head that are still visible. </p> <p>The medium of a graphic novel might seem counterintuitive for such heavy subject matter. It was certainly without precedent as a publication by a sitting congressman. But in fact, a little-known and sparingly pressed comic, the 1956 publication Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story, served as an integral part of Lewis’s early civil rights education in the principles and practices of non-violence. “It became like our Bible, our guide. It influenced so many of us,” Lewis says.</p> <p>The comic told the story of how black Montgomery citizens organized and used nonviolent resistance to protest and ultimately overturn Jim Crow segregation on buses in Montgomery and throughout the state of Alabama. Published by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a faith-based nonviolent action fellowship, the 14-page illustrated account of the Montgomery bus boycott has remained popular with activists around the globe for decades. It played a <a href=\"http://wamu.org/news/11/08/24/mlk_comic_book_helped_inspire_arab_spring.php\">major inspirational role in the 2011 Arab spring protests in Egypt</a>, for example.</p> <p>The congressman’s fond memories of the work are much of the reason why, when one of his staffers raised the idea of a graphic novel portrayal of Lewis’s stories from the movement, he was willing to at least give it some thought.</p> <p>“Finally, he said: OK, I’ll do it, but only if you write it with me,” said Andrew Aydin, a coauthor of the book. </p> <p>Aydin, a lifelong comics fan, said when Lewis first told him about The Montgomery Story, he was immediately hooked. “I’ll never forget going home that night and looking it up on the internet, reading about it, and just being absolutely fascinated with the idea of a comic book playing a meaningful role in the civil rights movement.”</p> <p>The idea for the series came on the day of Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, with the congressman telling some of his stories from the movement to visitors in his office. “All I could think is: I shouldn’t be the only one witnessing this,” Aydin said. “So part of it was finding a way to show everyone else what I saw that day.” To date, the books have been adopted by schools in more than 40 states, including in large districts like New York City, and have also been used by more than a dozen college “common reading” programs.</p> <p>Lewis said he saw the value in retelling the story of the civil rights movement as, essentially, an illustrated collection of memoirs because of the format’s accessibility to audiences of different ages. “When I first moved to Atlanta, I used to attend Dr Martin Luther King Sr’s church, and sometimes his son [King Jr] would be preaching. And Daddy King, as we called him, would say: ‘Make it plain, son, make it plain,’” Lewis recounted. Producing March “in the form of a graphic novel is making it plain and making it simple”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/black-lives-matter-release-policy-statement\">Coalition of activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter outline policy agenda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By making it plain, Lewis and Aydin are confident that the book can have a significant and sustained impact on a new generation of activists and protesters. “These smart, gifted young people are picking up where we left off,” Lewis said of the Black Lives Matter movement, praising the numerous nonviolent marches and acts of civil disobedience it has initiated. But March is also a cautionary tale. “Don’t make the same mistakes that we made. Stay focused,” Lewis said. “Never hate, never become bitter, never become hostile.” And on this point, Lewis believes modern activists would do well to copy the discipline and preparation of his generation.</p> <p>“We had so called ‘do’s and don’ts’, and we lived by those. The day the first mass arrest occurred in Nashville, Tennessee, every single student arrested, all 89 of us, had a copy on them,” Lewis said, adding: “Discipline is everything.” The “don’ts” included not to “strike back nor curse if abused”. The “dos” included to “remember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Love and nonviolence is the way.”</p> <p>And for Lewis, while the names and faces, and the exact contours of racial oppression, have certainly changed over the past half-century, the strategy has not. Lewis added: “Our struggle is not a struggle for a few days for a few days, a few weeks, a few months or a few years – it is a struggle of a lifetime.”</p>","wordcount":"1071","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-19T13:00:35Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qfcf","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3857c854cafc21d12db783fb25872d9e799873/0_103_5616_3370/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/comics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Comics and graphic novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/comics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/comics","references":[]},{"id":"world/civil-rights-movement","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Civil rights movement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/civil-rights-movement","references":[],"description":" Latest news and comment on civil rights movement"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/martin-luther-king","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Martin Luther King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"US Arts and Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Interviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jamiles-lartey","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Jamiles Lartey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiles-lartey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamiles-lartey","references":[],"bio":"<p>Jamiles Lartey is a reporter for Guardian US.

As the text landed in bookshops around the world, accusations began flying as readers debated whether the two young characters – Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter – were an example of “queerbaiting”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/04/ghostbusters-star-trek-beyond-gay-characters\">From Ghostbusters to Star Trek Beyond: Gay characters are there, but only just</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_baiting\">Queerbaiting</a> is a term that exists mostly in fan communities, and refers to the writers or creators of a world (whether of a movie franchise, a book series, or a TV show) using injections of homoeroticism and romance to draw an audience seeking LGBTQ representation, while not alienating a wider audience who may not want to see a gay relationship depicted. Think of the term “bromance” – a dynamic that employs romantic tropes, all the while not actually fulfilling them.</p> <p>Accusations of queerbaiting are more commonly directed towards television than books: TV shows such as House, Supernatural and Rizzoli &amp; Isles have all been singled out, while recent depictions of “confirmed bachelors” Sherlock Holmes and John Watson have also been accused of dabbling in manipulative homoeroticism.</p> <p>In the case of Harry Potter and the Possible Example of Queerbaiting, the accusation stems from the play’s portrayal of male friendship. Albus and Scorpius become very close friends from the beginning of their first year at Hogwarts. Both shy and shunned and neither much like their famous fathers, their friendship becomes critical. Albus and Scorpius make a fuss out of hugging (“We said we wouldn’t do that!”) in a manner resembling the common trope “Hot Gay Hugging”: a hilarious title for the less-than-funny absence of casual intimacy allowed between homosexual characters. Hetero couples get to kiss, the gays are limited to a (hot gay) hug. And Albus and Scorpius do go for it, with all the awkwardness you’d expect from two English lads.</p> <p>To be fair to the fans, Albus and Scorpius’s friendship in this story does seem to have a different inflection this time: they are intensely codependent and their intimacy is at one point compared to the doomed romance between Severus Snape and Lily Potter. When it was published, the script sent fans into a frenzy of discussion online. Believers have affectionately (or defiantly?) dubbed the couple “Scorbus”, while <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/2016/07/31/its-time-to-talk-about-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/\">a piece on Tor.com was rather more cautious</a>: “I’m all for depictions of strong friendships that define people, but Albus and Scorpius don’t read like Harry and Ron,” wrote <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/author/emily-asher-perrin/\">Emily Asher-Perrin</a>. Daily Dot writer Gavia Baker-Whitelaw, rather more bluntly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hello_Tailor/status/760137977691594752\">tweeted</a> an alternative title:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hello_Tailor/status/760137977691594752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Harry Potter and the Curse of Heteronomativity</p>&mdash; Gavia Baker-Whitelaw (@Hello_Tailor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hello_Tailor/status/760137977691594752\">August 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As someone who is not part of fan fiction communities myself, it is a little hard to find a way into this argument. But speaking to some in fandom, it seems people are holding Rowling personally accountable for the lack of romance because she has engaged with fan theories in the past. She has even retrospectively confirmed some – including Harry’s son Albus being sorted into Slytherin, and his becoming friends with Scorpius. Since Rowling <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7053982.stm\">outed Albus Dumbledore as a gay man</a> – retrospectively, once the books were finished and the character dead – readers have been impatient to see a gay character introduced in Harry Potter’s world.</p> <p>Some Scorbus got in well ahead of the Cursed Child: there is a cornucopia of Scorbus fan fiction online, with some stories dating back to years before the play was even announced. Because of this, some commentators are suspicious that the appetite for a Scorbus romance was not unknown to those catering to it.</p> <p>“The writers of the Cursed Child intentionally included this fan theory to draw us in, but decided to change it just enough so that they wouldn’t have to admit that they made two 11-year-olds gay,” Jameson Ortiz, an LGBTQ campaigner and Harry Potter fan, told me. “It’s queerbaiting because they knew exactly who they were reeling in and why, but still decided to leave out the main attraction for all the fans they hooked, choosing instead, like so many others, to set up the gay romance, hint at it constantly, make it believable and deep and perfect, and then force it out of the story.”</p> <p>Put aside sexuality for just one moment – regardless of whether you are gay or not, it is extremely important to see portrayals of deep, emotional, non-sexual romantic male friendships in popular culture. Currently, there are very few on offer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/04/jack-urwin-we-dont-need-to-be-the-men-our-grandfathers-were\">Toxic masculinity</a>, a social condition that dictates men must act a certain way in order to be acceptably manly, has damaged portrayals of male friendships on TV, in our films, on the page. Pop culture too often settles for stereotypes: men talk about sports, boast about sex, and don’t touch one another. Any emotional or physical closeness is brushed away as “gay” in a pejorative sense. Because of what we see, its no wonder there is a sense of insecurity and shame about physical intimacy of any sort between men – sexual or not. The lack of representation of even casual intimacy between men may be one of the reasons fans so desperately wish these male characters into romantic relationships – leading to accusations of queerbaiting when they don’t see their fantasy officially told. This isn’t to say that queerbaiting isn’t real – but there’s a reason why we see closeness between men as almost intrinsically gay. And that is a problem in itself.</p> <p>So while The Cursed Child is criticised for queerbaiting, it should be celebrated for what it<em> does</em> do on the page: portray a loving relationship between two boys, who may or may not be in love. Because that achievement, while maybe not as progressive as some may want, is still progress.</p>","wordcount":"952","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-22T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qang","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/855249a0f34572c29fe016b320f29faffda0d531/0_917_2882_1729/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/harrypotter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Harry Potter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/harrypotter","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"stage/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webTitle":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child","references":[]},{"id":"books/jkrowling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"JK Rowling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jkrowling","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Sexuality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"855249a0f34572c29fe016b320f29faffda0d531","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/855249a0f34572c29fe016b320f29faffda0d531/0_917_2882_1729/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Anthony Boyle (Scorpius Malfoy) and Sam Clemmett (Albus Potter) in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.","caption":"The curse of heteronormativity?

Its publisher, Candlewick, which had intended to release the novel on 9 August but has delayed it following the controversy, said it is told “largely in street dialect” by the Mexican-American Charlton-Trujillo, author of the award-winning Fat Angie.</p> <p>Charlton-Trujillo <a href=\"http://booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=8227716&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\">said in an interview</a> that “right from the jump, I could hear the music of T’s world that hadn’t existed in YA before. Slang can become dated quick, so I had a unique opportunity to incorporate some slang along with a new vernacular.”</p> <p>When We Was Fierce initially drew glowing pre-publication reviews from book magazines including Kirkus, <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ee-charlton-trujillo/when-we-was-fierce/\">which called it</a> a “compassionate, forceful look at the heartbreak and choices these black boys and men face at the lethal intersection of poverty and gang culture”, and Publishers Weekly, <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7636-7937-8\">which said it</a> was a “heartbreaking and powerful modern American story”.</p> <p>But others were less positive. Jennifer Baker, founder of the Minorities in Publishing podcast and part of We Need Diverse Books, called When We Was Fierce’s “constructed Ebonics … deeply offensive and extremely hard to read without having to reread, not for interest but for comprehension.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://campbele.wordpress.com/2016/07/24/guest-review-when-we-was-fierce/\">In a review on librarian Edith Campbell’s blog</a>, Baker said that “the narration in Fierce shows a blatant disregard and lazy vocabulary creation that’s continually insulting in the hopes that it’s avant garde” and slammed the novel’s references to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that “it feels like a carrot dangled to make the characters seem more real, but for those of us living this life and this fear in real time it’s another flippant element in a text rife with insult and lack of awareness”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://campbele.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/review-when-we-was-fierce/\">Campbell’s own review</a> said that “every major reviewer who embraced this book was impressed by the language Charlton-Trujillo <em>made up</em> for the contemporary characters in the book”, but asked: “Who makes up language when portraying real people living in a contemporary society? Just how entitled is that?”</p> <p>Charlton-Trujillo has said that the novel draws from her own experience as an outsider, as well as from her experiences mentoring young African American men and working with at-risk children across America. In an “<a href=\"http://www.candlewick.com/book_files/0763679372.ban.1.pdf\">note from the author</a>” on the Candlewick’s website, she writes: “Empowering at-risk youth to harness their narratives through writing in traditional and alternative schools, libraries, after-school programmes and juvenile detention centres showed me there is a deep need for a book like When We Was Fierce – one about making choices and having hard conversations.”</p> <p>“But it had to be something new, reimagined, more poetry than prose. The story … is a work of heightened-reality fiction, a story of four boys experiencing life as outsiders, told by someone who has spent her life as one. It is my hope that young people will connect with this book and that it may, even in some small way, make things better for them.”</p> <p>But Candlewick has now announced that the novel has been postponed. “After discussion between the author, her agent and Candlewick about the dramatic contrast between the pre-publication reviews, as compared to many of the social media and blog responses to When We Was Fierce, we decided together to take some time for further reflection and thus postponed publication,” <a href=\"http://www.slj.com/2016/08/diversity/when-we-was-fierce-pulled-as-demand-grows-for-more-ownvoices-stories/\">the publisher told School Library Journal</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/04/childrens-author-sorry-racial-insensitivity-smiling-slaves-emily-jenkins-a-fine-dessert\">Children's author sorry for 'racial insensitivity' in picture book showing smiling slaves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The delay follows the decision to pull a children’s picture book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/scholastic-george-washington-book-slave-controversy\">A Birthday Cake for George Washington</a>, earlier this year after it was criticised for the “dangerously rosy impression of the relationship between slaves and slave owners” it gave.

dream","byline":"Simon Mayo","body":"<p>Blame is the first novel I’ve written without the prop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/periodic-table\">the periodic table</a>. For my children’s series, Itch, whenever I needed inspiration for a plot twist, a vicious poison or a cunning escape, I could find it in <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/periodictable/pre16/develop/mendeleev.htm\">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>’s iconic arrangement of the elements. But that was before and this is after.</p> <p>Blame is set in the future and focuses on Ant and Mattie, a sister and brother who live in prison with their foster parents. They are “heritage criminals”, locked up in Spike, the family annexe of the new prison HMP London. Heritage crime decrees that we are responsible for any unpunished crimes committed by our parents and grandparents. It is a nightmarish, reactionary – and very popular – charge.</p> <p>I blame Michael Morpurgo for Blame. When he was compiling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/01/michael-morpurgo-only-remembered-first-world-war-memories\">Only Remembered</a>, a book of first world war stories, I contributed a chapter about my great uncle, Stanley Killingback, who was killed in 1916. It was a short piece, only a few hundred words, but I was writing for one of our greatest authors so each one needed to count. I sent it off and believed that was that. But – and please don’t snort in derision – that night I had a dream. I was in a queue, waiting to be admitted to prison. It had been discovered that my great uncle had been a deserter (he wasn’t), a crime that had gone unpunished, meaning I had to pay the price. Everyone in line with me was similarly convicted. It was a haunting, oppressive image and it lingered long into the day. My wife said I should write it down and so I did. Blame is the result.</p> <p>Blame is set in a post-EU world. A terrifying recession has ripped its way through most countries and everyone is looking for someone to blame. Many heritage criminals have had a good life, having “got away with it” without paying back to society what they owe. Locking up families has proved popular – everywhere except for Germany, which refuses to play the blame game again. So, for the resistance groups in Blame, German becomes the language of freedom. My prison is full of slang, some invented, some real. (There is enough to fill a glossary at the beginning of the book.)</p> <p>Some things change in the course of a writing a book, others stay the same. Ant (real name Abigail Norton Turner) was always clear to me. She was always biracial, she always had a shaved head, always had goose tattoos. She was always tricksy, angry and fierce but she was also loyal, brave and passionate. Her anger was righteous, a cold fury that could terrify at 20 paces. She might annoy you, she might scare you but you would definitely want Ant on your side.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ant screamed – a wailing banshee howl that made the whole platform stop and look. Those who could see her backed off as far as possible, and she screamed again. As this shriek was delivered to a near-silent station, the effect was dramatic.</p> <p>A path cleared for her and she ran, taking the steps in enormous leaps. Where new crowds threatened her progress, she screamed again. Steps, escalator, sprint, Ant flew towards the Piccadilly line. In the enclosed walkways that linked the underground system, her yells and threats bounced off the tiled walls.</p> <p>The platform was busy with the usual number of construction workers – all with their tell-tale prison security passes still visible – but she could still choose her spot. If she stood by that poster, she would be right outside the lifts at the next station.</p> <p>She knew the poster well. It showed a troubled-looking man in an armchair being questioned by his two young children. The caption read: ‘<em>Daddy, what did our family do before the Depression?’</em> It then dissolved into a smiling suited man holding up a pledge card. Underneath a bold ‘<em>Your past is your future!’</em> were the five ‘Freedom Questions’.</p> <p>Ant knew them by heart:</p> <p><em>What have you done today?<br /></em><em>Have you talked to your parents?<br /></em><em>What have you inherited?<br /></em><em>What are you passing on to your children?<br /></em><em>Is your family now, or has it ever been, a criminal family?</em></p> <p>If the ad hasn’t been on the wrong side of the tracks, she’d have thrown something at it.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>First of all, this book is incredibly detailed, which is similar to how Simon wrote the Itch books; there’s a lot of detail, so much so you can picture scenes with barely any doubt as to what a certain detail is supposed to look like. This helps you build a real sense of emotion and empathy with the characters, this may not be for everyone, but I think a lot of people will like it.</p> <p>Ant and Mattie are really amazing characters too. They’re described well and we get to know their personalities. The book is written in the third person, which I think makes it a little more impressive. At the same time, you’d expect to learn a lot about the characters in first person but there is a lot of attention given to describing the characters in detail. Every trait in the character is explored. <strong>– </strong><strong>confessionsofabooklover, </strong><strong>teen reviewer<br /></strong><strong><a

tangible","byline":"Nicholas Lezard","body":"<p>My fear, on picking this up, was that it would be a tiresome reduction of the work of two serious scientists to silliness. It’s been described as “steampunk”, which sets alarm bells ringing. I need not have worried. The only major tinkering with the historical record in the book is its proposal that Charles Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, the computer he designed in 1837 but never got round to building. (It would have been huge and difficult to construct; a working model of its predecessor, his Difference Engine, was only finally completed in 2000 – <a href=\"https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ada-lovelace-visionary-of-the-computer-age/\" title=\"\">you can see it in the Science Museum</a> – and even that apparently has a tendency to jam.)</p> <p>However, assert that the machine got built (Padua knows very well the difference between a Difference Engine and an Analytical Engine, but prefers to use the former term, on the understandable grounds that it is cooler), and the medium of comics is just the right way to proceed. I use the word “comics” rather than “graphic novel” not just because this isn’t a novel, but because it is often funny.</p> <p>Babbage’s chief collaborator – and, it would appear, the only collaborator he never fell out with, for he was that kind of a man – was Ada Lovelace. The sole legitimate child of Lord Byron, she was raised well away from him and encouraged by her mother to study mathematics, on the grounds that it was as far as you could get from poetry. Lovelace saw the possibilities of Babbage’s first machine, making the extraordinary intuitive leap that it could be used to calculate not only mathematical formulae, but, in theory if not in practice, pretty much anything, as our own computers do today.</p> <p>Padua launches a host of flights of fancy – George Eliot having the manuscript of <em>Scenes of Clerical Life</em> pulled to pieces as Babbage’s engine reduces it to searchable bits; Queen Victoria and the Duke of Wellington (on a horse) popping round to see how the machine works. “Knowledge is power,” says Babbage; Victoria – whose speech is written in gothic script – replies, “POWER is power”. What is remarkable is how often, as we learn in extremely engaging and well written footnotes and endnotes, such flights of fancy have a basis in reality.</p> <p>For example, I was particularly delighted when the number 0 – here represented as the corner of the Argand plane (an x axis of real numbers and a y axis of imaginary numbers) – turned into Humpty Dumpty: it makes the occasional weirdness of mathematics compellingly tangible. And Padua is justified in drawing on the <em>Alice</em> books: Lewis Carroll visited Babbage in the hope of procuring a calculating machine, and was shown such bits as were available to look at. Indeed, much of the book seems to breathe the air of Wonderland – just as Wonderland itself breathes the air of algebraic mathematics (“Divide a loaf by a knife – what’s the answer to that?” asks the White Queen, for example. We are reminded of this, and much else, by Padua).</p> <p>In short, this is an utter joy, but also, to hazard a semi-educated opinion, mathematically sound. The 19th century was when mathematics started getting weird, and the idea that a machine could have an emergent intelligence began to take root. Babbage and Lovelace were, in a sense, ahead of their time; Padua brings them into ours. She is also honest enough to raise the question of whether Lovelace’s contributions and reputation have not been inflated by a desire to squeeze a woman into mathematical history; and the way she answers this question is extremely plausible. For Padua has done her research: she has teased out the connections between Babbage, Lovelace and what would seem to be the whole of Victorian culture and society – and done so in a way that appears almost effortless on the page, her light, easy graphic style an excellent vehicle not only for deep and complex thought, but for excellent, and sometimes excellently corny, jokes.

It would, I think, be worth tracking down for one essay alone: <a href=\"http://www.fsgbookkeeping.com/revisiting-the-backlist-marrying-libraries/\" title=\"\">Marrying Libraries</a>, in which Fadiman describes, five years after getting hitched, her efforts to merge her books with those of her husband, George. Not only was there the problem of duplicates, the vexed question of whose copy of <em>Middlemarch</em> or <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> deserved to stay, and whose to go; organisation was an issue, too. For while Fadiman liked to Balkanise by nationality and subject matter, favouring a chronological arrangement within each category, George was more laissez-faire. Across the Mason-Dixon Line that separated the two collections in their loft, his books were to be found in a state of near chaos.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The planning of my holiday reading remains a protracted, agonising business.

It was clear that she had a lot on her plate. But it was also obvious how tempting she found the idea. This was, you understand, long before the arrival of the Kindle. In the silence that followed, I could almost hear her brain working, the slight panic as she pictured a pile of paperbacks in her mind’s eye.</p> <p>I understood it perfectly. I do own a Kindle, but I’ve never taken to it, for which reason the planning of my holiday reading remains a protracted, agonising business. With a week to go, I’m not there yet; two near certs were summarily dismissed only last week, when a publisher sent me both the new Jay McInerney, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bright-precious-days-428523.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Bright, Precious Days</em></a>, and the new Ann Patchett, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/commonwealth-428557.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Commonwealth</em></a> (hardbacks, alas, but what can you do?).

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/19/matt-haig-as-therapy-shows-words-can-be-medicine\">Matt Haig: 'As therapy shows, words can be medicine'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is it strange that an author who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/reasons-to-stay-alive-matt-haig-review-depression\">very open about his experiences with depression</a> (and, indeed, wrote an entire book about them) should have written one of the most beautiful, most hopeful books of recent years? </p> <p>Well, no – if there’s one thing you need buckets of to plough through depression, it’s hope. And Matt Haig is an expert on both.</p> <p>His novel The Humans looks at our species through the eyes of an alien, sent to Earth to possess a mathematician who has proved <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis\">the Riemann hypothesis</a>, and destroy all evidence of his discovery. The advanced alien race believes it is safest for the universe at large if advanced mathematical knowledge is kept out of human hands. Really, given our track record with ever bigger bombs, it isn’t a silly argument.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It​ is easy to forget just how wonderful we can be ... Haig dwells on this wonder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the book hinges on the belief that humanity is irresponsible, violent and a bit stupid, bear with me: we’re getting to the hopeful part. The unnamed alien, disguised as mathematician Andrew Martin, learns that there is more to us than a broad brush can show. He discovers, through interactions with Martin’s unfulfilled wife, Isobel and his troubled teenage son, Gulliver, that individual humans are capable of wonders.</p> <p>In the current political climate, it is easy to feel enormously unhopeful about the state of the human race. We buy into fear-mongering far too quickly. We are possessive and defensive and reluctant to share whatever power we manage to scavenge. We let the planet slowly boil while obsessing over selfies and celebrity gossip. We can be infinitely frustrating. Truly, as the alien discovers, dogs – a “hairy domestic deity”, as he calls them – are a far nicer species than humans.</p> <p>It is easy, under the weight of overwhelming evidence that we are terrible, to forget just how wonderful we can be, as can the universe. Haig dwells on this wonder, marvelling at how unlikely life is, both in the broader sense and on an individual level. Everyone on Earth is the result of ever-dwindling odds through thousands of generations – and yet here we all are, sharing a planet together.</p> <p>Haig doesn’t obscure the flaws of humans or dress them up as something pretty: we are all a mess of strengths, weaknesses and contradictions that form a (mostly) complete person. In becoming a human himself, the alien at the heart of The Humans begins to appreciate our complexities, perhaps better than we do, with the luxury of perspective. And our privileges, too: the alien has no knowledge of love.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>At its heart, The Humans is a love story but it isn’t a romance. The alien begins to fall in love with Martin’s wife, which is captured by Haig in a way that makes love – something we’re all so used to that we barely notice it any more – seem like magic. But the alien also comes to love Martin’s son, Gulliver, and his dog, Newton, and peanut butter, and the poems of Emily Dickinson, and the Beach Boys. Love is not always a last-minute airport dash; it can be something more normal, less noticeable. But The Humans notices it, and forces the reader to recognise it in themselves and the world around them.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>In a recurring motif in the book, Haig reminds us that the average human life is 30,000 days long. In a bravura list of advice towards the end of the book, he tells us how to make the most of these days: through love, creation, curiosity, beauty and generosity, to yourself and others. That was the moment for me; after tackling the book in one sitting, I finished it in a flood of tears, feeling a swell of gratitude and hope. If you don’t feel an emotional tug at your heartstrings when you’re reminded of all the remarkable possibilities of humanity, then you’ve read this book incorrectly. Or you’ve never owned a dog.</p>","wordcount":"660","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-19T07:30:28Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pkec","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/224e52f67ab15ea5575d02592c5b90bb9a8c01d0/0_567_5710_3425/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/books-to-give-you-hope","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books

Cummins","body":"<p>Imagine that the Man Booker prize had always been open to novels from the US. Would Graham Swift’s <em>Last Orders</em> still have won in 1996, the year David Foster Wallace published <em>Infinite Jest</em>? How about Ian McEwan’s <em>Amsterdam</em>, the year Don DeLillo published <em>Underworld</em>?</p> <p>It’s hard not to feel that a certain anxiety about answering (or even asking) those questions might lurk behind talk of the prize having lost its identity, after the recent rule change that lets the panel nominate US writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/30/david-means-you-cant-take-a-short-story-stretch-it-out-that-does-not-a-novel-make\" title=\"\">David Means</a>. <em>Hystopia</em>, about a parallel America during the Vietnam war, exhibits a level of conceptual and stylistic density that British novelists seldom hazard; it flies the flag on <a href=\"http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/news/man-booker-prize-announces-2016-longlist\" title=\"\">this year’s longlist</a> for the kind of maximalist aesthetic the judges were once obliged to ignore.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Means avoids clarity and spends a lot of time outlining his alternative reality in a vortex of fiddly counterfactuals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Set in the late 1960s, the story turns on the development of a psychiatric remedy known as “enfolding”, intended to suppress painful memories. The procedure is being tested at a secret facility in New Mexico, where traumatised veterans re-enact combat scenes while doped up on a horse sedative called Tripizoid. It doesn’t work – surprise – and soon runaway patients are bringing mayhem to American streets already lawless with biker gangs and riots.</p> <p>We focus on one of these fugitive “enfolds”, Rake, a murderous psychopath who rampages around the midwest, daubing pentagrams with the blood of his victims. He abducts a mentally ill woman, Meg, and coerces her into abetting his crimes before imprisoning her at a woodland hideout. On Rake’s tail are two lovestruck agents from a shadowy federal agency: Singleton (another enfolded vet) and Wendy, described as a “strange mix of kindness and care and wildness”.</p> <p>The action takes place in short segments that cut between Meg’s point of view and Singleton’s. Pace isn’t the object: Means deliberately avoids clarity and spends a lot of time outlining his alternative reality in a vortex of fiddly counterfactuals, chiefly to do with the assassination of JFK, reconfigured in ways that prove less important than billed. It’s also stated from the outset that the events summarised above are merely what happens in “Hystopia” – a posthumously published novel by a 22-year-old Vietnam veteran who committed suicide after the death of his mentally ill sister, Meg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/01/slade-house-david-mitchell-review-haunted-house\">Slade House by David Mitchell review – gleeful, skin-crawling brilliance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Means throws the kitchen sink at disorienting the reader, <em>Hystopia</em> eventually boils down to a tricked-out chase narrative. Even the odder elements of his scenario have pretty familiar effects. The so-called enfolds are able to access their repressed memories through orgasm, which elevates “sexposition” to new heights of absurdity – as Means well knows. “All that conveniently in your unfold,” says Wendy, as Singleton unburdens himself mid-clinch.</p> <p>The wink is typical. Introducing the novel-within-a-novel, supposedly published in 1974, the anonymous editor tells us it was “hardly fit for the fiction market at the time (or at any time) but was publishable because of the marketability of the so-called backstory”.</p> <p>That multi-level joke aims partly to reassure any readers who may feel lost in the darkness of a novel that gambles heavily on you sticking around until the lights go up. The slow trickle of revelations, punctuated by sex and bloodletting, leads in the end to an explanation of why “Hystopia” was written in the first place; as a character study in which the lead character never appears, it’s certainly clever.

saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor all night, upon the sea,” writes Marcel Proust, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/15/perfect-proust-translation-for-purists\">Swann’s Way, 1913 translated by CK Scott Moncrieff</a>.</p> <p>“But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable ‘fine weather’ of winter, its very opposite in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens its silken banners, violet and white.”</p> <p>His remembrance of things past extended even to the sound of rainwater “dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night.”</p> <p><br /></p>","wordcount":"256","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T20:30:14Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4ytc4","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/366d749d9cb70209a9df8ed7eb776a49326e620e/0_0_3243_1946/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"news/series/weatherwatch","type":"series","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Weatherwatch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/weatherwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/series/weatherwatch","references":[],"description":"Our regular column investigating the stories behind the weather"},{"id":"science/meteorology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webTitle":"Meteorology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/meteorology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/meteorology","references":[]},{"id":"books/marcelproust","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Marcel Proust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/marcelproust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/marcelproust","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-weather","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-weather","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/timradford","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Tim Radford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timradford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/timradford","references":[],"bio":"<p>Tim Radford is a freelance journalist and a founding editor of <a href=\"http://climatenewsnetwork.net/\">Climate News Network</a>.

The book is a sequel to 1599, about another eventful year in Shakespeare’s life, which won Shapiro, a leading authority on Shakespeare, <a href=\"http://www.thesamueljohnsonprize.co.uk/images/2006-winner-james-shapiro\">the 2006 Samuel Johnson prize</a>.</p> <p>“Shapiro quite brilliantly interweaves the material found in the 1606 plays with the historical events of this momentous year, allowing us in the process new perspectives on familiar material,” said biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild. “He is particularly deft in the ways that he writes about often arcane detail for a non-specialist readership.

Set in a semi-derelict Detroit in 2008, around the time of the financial crash and Barack Obama’s election, Markovits’s novel follows a group of idealists who move to the area as a part of a social experiment to drive “the Groupon model of gentrification”. The Texan author, who now teaches creative writing at University of London, saw off shortlist competition from Beatlebone by Kevin Barry, The Wolf Border by Sarah Hall and The First Bad Man by Miranda July.</p> <p>Fiction judge Dr Alex Lawrie called Markovits’s book an “astonishing state-of-the-nation novel … You Don’t Have To Live Like This forces us to re-examine our own prejudices and advantages, and the impact these have on our willingness to behave in an ethical and socially responsible manner.”</p> <p>Previous winners of the fiction prize include Angela Carter, Cormac McCarthy, Ian McEwan and Evelyn Waugh, while famous winners in the biography category include Peter Ackroyd, Martin Amis, Hermione Lee and Claire Tomalin.</p> <p>The winner of a third category, for drama, which began in 2013, will be announced at the festival next week.</p>","wordcount":"458","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-21T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vvkk","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e83ced4d84f98b08a3612624ab9c4a54d999dde1/0_1290_3512_2106/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/jamestaitblackprize","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Tait Black memorial prize","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamestaitblackprize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamestaitblackprize","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/awards-and-prizes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Awards and prizes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/history","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"History","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/history","references":[]},{"id":"books/edinburgh-book-festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Edinburgh international book festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival","references":[]},{"id":"books/biography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Biography","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/biography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/biography","references":[]},{"id":"culture/edinburghfestival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburghfestival","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sian-cain","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Sian Cain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sian-cain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/sian-cain","references":[],"bio":"<p>Sian Cain is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books\">books site</a> editor.

But Lear noted in a late diary entry that he had “almost always” managed to keep his sometimes “heartstopping and braintwisting” seizures secret. The forms of Lear’s grand mal seizures seem to have varied and there are indications that he sometimes had absence seizures (petit mal).</p> <p>It was not only in the culture of Emily Dickinson’s polite America that epilepsy was associated with syphilis, insanity and masturbation, both in the popular imagination and among influential medics. The many editions of the pamphlet Onania, first published in England circa 1715, established masturbation as a cause of epilepsy, and for a while one of Lear’s sisters slept in his bedroom to make sure he did not give way to “impurity”. Lear would have been in accord with Graham Greene’s doctor who prescribed “good walks”, but did not live long enough to enjoy the benefits of Kepler’s malt extract.<br /><strong>Charles Lewsen</strong><br /><em>Bristol</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>","wordcount":"193","commentable":"false","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vvck","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/608c0948cd6e115f1b5dfa4319715cf39ad42503/0_229_2112_1267/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"society/epilepsy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Epilepsy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/epilepsy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/epilepsy","references":[]},{"id":"tone/letters","type":"tone","webTitle":"Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/letters","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Letters and Leader Writers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Mental health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/mental-health","references":[]},{"id":"society/health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/health","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"books/emilydickinson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Emily Dickinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/emilydickinson","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"Editorials & reply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"608c0948cd6e115f1b5dfa4319715cf39ad42503","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/608c0948cd6e115f1b5dfa4319715cf39ad42503/0_229_2112_1267/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Edward Lear (1812-88), author of A Book of Nonsense","caption":"Edward Lear (1812-88), the author of A Book of Nonsense, felt shamed by his epilepsy.

Who could forget Goblet of Fire’s majestic dragons, the hippogriffs of Prisoner of Azkaban, Chamber of Secrets’ giant arachnid, Aragog, or the soul-sucking dementors? </p> <p>Now, thanks to the new issue of Entertainment Weekly, we have our first proper look at some of the monstrous entities who look set to escape from the Tardis-like briefcase of Eddie Redmayne’s Newt Scamander in the upcoming prequel Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. </p> <h2>Some could prove almost impossible to catch</h2> <p>We know the basic premise of Fantastic Beasts. Scamander arrives in the Big Apple, suffers a mishap that causes many of his pet monstrosities to escape, and presumably spends the rest of the movie trying to put everything back in the box. But how do you go about re-capturing a Demiguise, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707933_demiguise\">described as</a> “a primate-like creature that resembles a silver-haired orangutan with large, doleful black eyes”, when the darned thing has the ability to go invisible at any time and can also use its magical abilities to predict what you’re about to do next? This particular beast could be harder to track down than Pikachu. </p> <h2>Others look more cute than scary</h2> <p>The cheeky little Niffler, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707918_fantastic-beasts-and-where-find-them-niffler\">we’re told</a>, resembles a cross between a mole and a duck-billed platypus. But don’t be fooled by its benign countenance, the ferrety little magical marsupial is after your treasures. It will go hunting for precious things – coins, jewelry or just about anything shiny – with relentless determination, before carting off any ill-gotten gains in its seemingly bottomless pouch.</p> <h2>Newt might not be the only ones after them</h2> <p>There’s a reason the bumbling magizoologist keeps his magical creatures safely out of sight: some of them are very valuable indeed. The aforementioned Demiguise is sought after for its pelt, which can be made into invisibility coats. And the sinister Occamy, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707763_occamy\">described as</a> a “plumed, two-legged, winged creature with a serpentine body ... like a cross between a dragon and a bird” lays eggs of pure silver. It’s also capable of contracting or expanding in size depending on its environment. </p> <h2>Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy has a cute little cousin</h2> <p>As briefly mentioned in Order of the Phoenix, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707928_bowtruckle\">the Bowtruckle</a> is a plant-like species that can apparently be used to pick locks. Scamander is said to have several of these as pets, and keeps one named Pickett in his top pocket. It’s not yet known if they are capable of Groot-like speech or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMYt4HvUxIM\">funky disco dancing moves</a>. </p> <h2>Thunderbirds are go</h2> <p>A majestic white bird seen briefly in Fantastic Beasts’ recent trailers, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707938_thunderbird\">this creature</a> has the ability to see danger before it happens and can create storms with the beating of its wings, which must be useful when there’s a drought on in its native Arizona. We’re told Scamander promised to return a Thunderbird named Frank to its home after rescuing the creature from traffickers in Egypt, which might just explain what the English wizard is doing in north America in the first place.</p> <p>Regular Rowling watchers might recall that the author-turned-screenwriter was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">accused of appropriating indigenous culture</a> for her debut foray into North American wizarding culture back in March. The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in many Native American cultures, so there could be more trouble brewing here. </p> <h2>Fear now has wings</h2> <p>The freakiest beastie on show, and perhaps the fastest if its fleeting appearance in trailers is anything to go by, looks to be a flying reptile named <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707923_swooping-evil\">Swooping Evil</a> that might just be Fantastic Beasts’ answer to the terrifying dementors. Resembling a spiky butterfly or airborne manta ray in terms of its shape and mode of flight, it also has the unfortunate habit of sucking the brains out of living creatures, like a cross between a vampire and a zombie.

There <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10746515\">TommyCockles1 </a>provided a fascinating recommendation:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>I’m about half way through Storm of Steel by Ernst Junger. A soldier’s memoir of his experiences on the Western Front in the First World War, it’s the first account I’ve read from a German perceptive. It also differs in its tone; while all around him is broad destruction and arbitrary death, young Ernst is seemingly having the time of his life. He does convey the fear and the horrors endured by the men, although none of it seems to make a lasting impression on him ... it’ll be interesting to see what impact the final two years of the war will have on him (if any).</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As you might expect, the immediate follow-up to that was a recommendation for EM Remarque’s All Quiet On The Western Front. “Truly,” says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15040504\">MildGloster</a>, “one of the most beautiful, heartbreaking, delicate pieces of work concerning the Great War I have ever read.” <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16064333\">machenbach </a>also recommended the astonishing <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/schlump-by-hans-herbert-grimm-book-review-10181522.html\">Schlump</a>.</p> <p>One of the week’s most intriguing questions came from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15134444\">katcalls</a>, who named Keri Hulme, Abraham Verghese, Erin Morgenstern and Chard Harbach as offenders:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>What of those authors who are painfully slow in their output? There are a few authors that come to mind whom I wish would just hurry up.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Answers so far have included George RR Martin (obviously), Donna Tartt, and Rohinton Mistry. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11656907\">BerlinBirdie </a>also says: </p> <blockquote> <p><em>JK Rowling apparently still has hundreds of Harry Potter ideas in her head, though she obviously feels she’s written down enough of them. It made me quite envious to hear that - you’d never get bored, would you?!</em></p> </blockquote> <p>For all sorts of reasons, that thought leaves me feeling curiously bereft. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a> has been mulling over Hermann Hesse:<br /></p> <blockquote> <p><em>I loved Steppenwolf, and Narcissus and Goldmund is on my reading list. Are there any other good ones? The only other one I’ve read is Siddhartha, which I found kind of mellow and nice without having a strong connection to.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>A reader called <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2381358\">kmir </a>recommended Knulp: “It always makes me think of the ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0_hkzCl4nI\">swing scene</a>’ in Kurosawa’s Ikiru.” The mighty Glass Bead Game also got favourable mention, while <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252\">conedison</a> told a suitably revelatory story about discovering one the 1960s counter-culture’s favourite authors:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>I was introduced to Hermann Hesse’s work when in the mid 60’s on a plane going to LA, Mary Travers of Peter, Paul &amp; Mary was strolling up and down the aisle handing out copies of Magister Ludi like they were gumballs. I guess she was proselytising. I guess I was converted.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Another kind of enlightenment was discussed in lovely post from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10247310\">Sara Richards</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>We were in Shropshire for a three day break - Travelodge + dog - and it rained relentlessly for our first full day. So we went to Hay on Wye, a dangerous place for book addicts. We were careful and managed to limit our purchases for once.</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Among the titles that caught my eye was Loves Work by Gillian Rose. Rose was born into an orthodox Jewish family, was dyslexic but learnt to read so well that she read philosophy at Oxford. About this she writes, “The oppressive opulence of Oxford was married to a vision of philosophy which would have induced me a lifelong alienation from it, had I not already made the pact with my daemon.” Later, in New York, she was to discover contemporary continental philosophy which rekindled the flame.</em></p> <p><em>This is a book that I know I will return to many times because it covers so many of the themes that concern me, Judaism, philosophy, love, loss and suffering. This isn’t a misery memoir but rather a reflection on those themes which is moving and ultimately hopeful. Rose wrote, “To live, to love, is to be failed” but those failures are magnificent in the lessons to be learnt. </em><br /></p> <p><em>The last line in this short book reads, “I will stay in the fray, in the revel of ideas and risk, learning, failing, wooing, grieving, trusting, working, reposing...” Gillian Rose was only to stay in the fray for another year</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>James Ellroy gets a mention just about every week here on TLS, and generally (and justly), a pretty favourable one. But here to redress the balance is <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>. He loved LA Confidential and American Tabloid. But, White Jazz, less so:<br /></p> <blockquote> <p><em> 75-95% of it is almost incomprehensible garbage. The trashiest writing that I’ve read in years. How the same author who wrote The Black Dahlia, </em><em>The Big Nowhere, and L.A. Confidential could produce this dog of a book is absolutely beyond me.</em></p> <p><em>The only reason I’m persisting with it -and believe me, it’s a struggle trying to understand most of this great big steaming pile of waste, is because some of the characters appear in American Tabloid, which is next on my TBR list. (I’m not even game to take a peep at it, lest it turns out to be similar.)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Ouch! Even Homer nods and even Ellroy goes down to the dumps. Although, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4665915\">VelmaNebraska </a>did put in a few good words for the book: “Despite some niggles, I dug <em>White Jazz</em> at least as much as, if not more than, the rest of the LA Quartet.”</p> <p>Finally, here’s <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15186583\">murderofone</a> who is in the enviable position of reading the great Philip Roth for the first time: </p> <blockquote> <p><em>I’m reading American Pastoral by Phillip Roth. It’s my first book of his and I’m startled by the depth in which he gets into the mind of the protagonist. Moreover, Roth’s mastery as an author is his ability to jump around the various timescales in the novel with total ease - he doesn’t require a new chapter to go back or forward twenty years in the narrative. Sometimes, he doesn’t even need a new paragraph! I’m about two thirds of the way through and really enjoying it: a beautifully AMERICAN novel in the same way as Steinbeck’s East of Eden.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>There are many more fine novels where that one came from...</p> <h2>Interesting links about books and reading</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2016/why-audio-better-print/\">A controversial claim</a> that audio is a better way to consume books than print.<br /></li> <li>The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/travel/london-bookstores.html?_r=0\">expresses surprise</a> at wi-fi free British bookshops.<br /></li> <li>A <a href=\"http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/penguin-novel-paintings-with-sarcastic-and-pessimistic-titles\">display of sarcastic titles</a> on classic Penguin covers.<br /></li> <li>Catch up on President Obama’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/12/presidents-summer-reading-list\">summer reading list</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

In February 2014 they opened a bookstore-bar-venue that has since invigorated the local cultural landscape and it’s perceived by many as the catalyst of what some are starting to call the Dallas Literary Scene.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boaZV-0EXdE\">a TEDx talk</a> they gave this year at the University of Texas in Arlington they highlight the need for spaces to encourage conversations in these smartphone times. “Conversations and human interaction, those are the raw materials stories are made” they say. If books can be the perfect icebreaker, this bookstore bar may as well feed some great literature coming from Dallas in the following years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0a69667dbe4590ece92809c81962159cbde2e39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0a69667dbe4590ece92809c81962159cbde2e39/0_0_700_467/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Wild Detectives\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wild Detectives</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Haubert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What’s your favorite section of the store?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés de la Casa-Huertas (Brand Director): </em>Local authors. Well, it’s not really a section per se; all the authors are mingled on our shelves, Ben Fountain is preceded by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Louisa Hall is followed by Jim Harrison and so on. But these guys are people we know, authors who’ve been presenting their books in the bookstore, books we’ve read and enjoyed. We feel very proud of our writers and it’s great to see when their books are selling well.</p> <p><strong>If you had infinite space what would you add?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>That would be nice—our space isn’t very big and curation is key. It would be great to have more translations because there is so much great international Literature out there. We’d also like to have more non-fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c05a64a83d534ea7b7ab12b597bd8eb4b0794255\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c05a64a83d534ea7b7ab12b597bd8eb4b0794255/0_0_400_600/333.jpg\" alt=\"The Wild Detectives\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you do better than any other bookstore?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>Cocktails!</p> <p><strong>Who’s your favourite regular?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>It’s not just a person. We’re very lucky to be part of an amazing community that is deeply involved in promoting culture and in making it accessible for everyone. Some of our regulars, like John Bradley or Kelsey Capps, have become collaborators, sharing their articles on our website. Our friend Vicky Sanz helps us by moderating our Spanish language events and also writes on our website. Another friend, Lauren Smart, joined us last May to program a month of events to bring visibility to women in Literature and the Arts. Will Evans, the man behind Deep Vellum, has brought some of his book presentations to the shop. There are also people like Katherine Bourne from Shakespeare in the Bar, Fatima-Ayan Malika Hirsi from Dark Moon Poetry, Courtney Marie, Leah Tieger, organizations like WordSpace, collectives like Bonehouse or House Party Theatre, Josh Kummler from Bar Politics — and we’re sure we’re missing some — they bring their projects to our space. They are the real reason why we have become a cultural landmark in Dallas. We couldn’t be more grateful for that.</p> <p><strong>What’s the craziest situation you’ve ever had to deal with in the store?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>When we had to hire security because Merritt Tierce was doing a reading in the shop. In 2014, a local newspaper ran the story of how she got a $2000 tip from conservative talk show mogul Rush Limbaugh when she was a waiter at a high-end Dallas steakhouse and gave the entire thing to an abortion rights fund. The story didn’t sit well among pro-life supporters, who felt the need to threaten Tierce’s own life. Quite a paradox, don’t you think?</p> <p><strong>What’s your earliest/best memory about visiting a bookstore as a child?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>The more vivid memory I have about books is actually from my hometown library back in Spain. Probably because I’m in essence a lazy person, I used to think about how cool it would be if my brain could vaccuum all the content in those books at once. I’d become the smartest person alive! I guess I’m also a bit megalomaniac.</p> <p><strong>If you weren’t running or working at a bookstore, what would you be doing?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>I’d be reading more for sure.</p> <p><strong>What’s been the biggest surprise about running a bookstore?</strong></p> <p><em>Andrés: </em>Definitely it’s been people’s reaction to our initiative, how they’ve embraced it and become part of it. We’ve been very lucky with the local media who’s written great pieces about us and helped us promote our events. Dallas has treated us well. We’re nothing but grateful.</p> <h2>The staff shelf</h2> <p><strong>What are The Wild Detectives’s booksellers </strong><strong>r</strong><strong>eading?</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e97798f8f5c909614ce07f3f42270d1c7241596a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e97798f8f5c909614ce07f3f42270d1c7241596a/0_0_344_499/344.jpg\" alt=\"Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget by Sarah Hepola\" width=\"344\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blackout-413512.html\">Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget</a> by Sarah Hepola (2015). </strong>Andrés recommends: “Sarah Hepola’s drunk stories are dark-humored, quite enjoyable and endearing (it’s impossible not to root for her), bittersweet sometimes, but it’s the second half of the book, in which she shares her experience after quitting and coming to terms with herself, that becomes an insightful and poignant manual to fight bare hands the “complete inability to tolerate the moment.”</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/stoner.html\">Stoner</a> by John Williams (1965). </strong>Paco recommends: “In addition to a profound display of knowledge about the human condition, Stoner is an irresistible exhibition of command of the Art of Literature resulting into one of last Century’s top masterpieces. In this time and age it is really hard to think what interest if any could be found in looking into your inner self, that part of your person of which you cannot take any selfies; this novel clears the matter up.”</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1dc847308938816e2b9580cdb377a93375dd4beb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dc847308938816e2b9580cdb377a93375dd4beb/0_0_1333_2000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Story of My Teeth by Valeria Luiselli\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-story-of-my-teeth-387164.html\">The Story of my Teeth </a>by Valerie Luiselli (2015)</strong>. Carlos recommends: “Those who have been following the young Mexican author’s writings will find this a departure from her almost avant-garde cosmopolitanism to a warmer and evocative style, much in the tradition of Borges’ and Marquez’ magical realism. But, the “magic” is in the characters and scenarios she creates and how “real” she can make the preposterous and outlandish seem. Unique, funny, a little off, but will definitely leave a lasting impression.</li> </ul>","wordcount":"1022","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-21T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qfxf","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/829b9ef69a3f4d217997c21920016c471299f510/100_0_620_372/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/interview-with-a-bookstore-by-literary-hub","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Interview with a Bookstore by Literary Hub","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/interview-with-a-bookstore-by-literary-hub","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/interview-with-a-bookstore-by-literary-hub","references":[],"description":"<p>Stories and anecdotes from booksellers around the world – plus book recommendations straight from their staff.

treatment of Muslims and how we tackle radicalisation","byline":"Faizah Shaheen","body":"<p>A few weeks ago, as I prepared for my honeymoon in Turkey, the usual concerns of a Muslim traveller went through my mind. Will I be the one singled out? Will I get checked more than someone else just for being who I am?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/woman-reading-book-about-syria\">What to do when the book police arrive: read on | AL Kennedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although I wasn’t aware of this at the time, a cabin crew member on my outbound flight reported to the authorities that I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/04/british-woman-held-after-being-seen-reading-book-about-syria-on-plane\" title=\"\">reading a book</a> called Syria Speaks: Art and Culture from the Frontline, a collection of <a href=\"http://www.saqibooks.co.uk/book/syria-speaks/\" title=\"\">literature, poems, photos, songs and cartoons</a> from Syrian artists and writers. The first clue I had that something was wrong was when I landed in Turkey and was stopped while leaving the plane. I was told this was a “random check” but I was the only passenger to be stopped. Our trip was off to a horrible start. Further tensions occurred as our stay was disrupted due to the military coup and as a result, we had to cancel our flight to Istanbul and were stranded in Marmaris, our resort. We salvaged the remainder of our honeymoon as best we could.</p> <p>On our return to the UK, two police officers were waiting for me as soon as I arrived through passport control. My husband and I were taken to a room for questioning under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act for approximately 30 minutes. Among questions about my reasons for travelling to Turkey, my work and the number of languages I speak, they asked me to show them the book I had been reading and explain what it was about. The whole experience left me feeling disappointed and angry.</p> <p>Incidents like this seem to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-anti-muslim-discrimination-a-terrible-social-injustice\" title=\"\">happening to Muslims</a> frequently. We are all well aware that radicalisation of the most vulnerable is growing and is of great concern. We recognise that there is some good work being carried out by organisations, tackling issues around radicalisation. However, my experience raises several questions. Is the Terrorism Act being misused? And why are a growing number of Muslims being victimised?</p> <p>It is important that we have policies and procedures in place to tackle radicalisation. It is equally important that the Terrorism Act is not misused and we keep a sense of proportion. There is a gap, perhaps, between the implementation of the act and the levels of training of different agencies. And so the way forward would be to re-evaluate the act and reassess the implementation to determine where the legislation has been used appropriately and where it has not.</p> <p>I have always felt cautious making judgments on cases around radicalisation, but this experience has made me more aware of the regrettable scar it can leave on people when a misjudgment is made. Singling out people in this way could cause, for certain individuals, quite a detrimental effect to their overall wellbeing.</p> <p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that a high number of those who become radicalised suffer from mental health problems. I work as a mental health practitioner for the NHS, and have worked with a variety of client groups including vulnerable young people from all backgrounds who are at potential risk of radicalisation. Within mental health services we provide interventions around challenging ideologies, and we monitor risk. Early identification, intervention and prevention can tackle potential radicalisation.</p> <p>In my field of work, I recognise that some individuals have been made vulnerable due to factors such as a sense of injustice, peer pressure, negative media and a lack of a sense of belonging.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a multicultural society, we must be proactive in finding solutions to tackle radicalisation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being victimised due to a mistake can have such a negative impact that it could lead to higher potential risk of radicalisation. Such events may lead to someone feeling a lack of social acceptance and to experiencing increased vulnerabilities.</p> <p>My experience has stopped me from reminiscing about our honeymoon positively. It has also introduced a new element of paranoia into my life, which sadly joins a back catalogue of turbulent feelings I already possess as a western Muslim woman. The book that prompted all this, Syria Speaks, was an inspiring read, and it is good to hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/11/sales-of-syrian-culture-anthology-soar-after-woman-held-for-reading-it-on-plane\" title=\"\">sales have soared</a> since my story was reported by the press. This means that the Syrian authors in the collection will be more widely read and I truly hope more people get a chance to discover its nuance and depth. I <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/FaizahShaheen?  utm_medium=\" email&amp;utm_source=\"ExactTarget&amp;utm_campaign=20160812_57019&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">stand in solidarity</a> with the innocent citizens of Syria and will continue to strive for and anticipate an end to the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p> <p>Even though it has been an overwhelming few weeks for me, I’m pleased that sharing my story has raised a number of issues that need to be urgently addressed. I feel I can help to give a voice to victims who have experienced something similar but face various barriers to speaking out.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, as a multicultural society, we must stop simply talking about tackling radicalism and instead be proactive in finding solutions to manage it.</p>","wordcount":"828","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-15T20:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vvbv","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/42d6f6603b9bc13268cda260550dc371259e74d9/0_226_3390_2034/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"law/schedule-7","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webTitle":"Schedule 7","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/schedule-7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/schedule-7","references":[],"description":"The latest news and comment on schedule 7 of the UK Terrorism Act 2000"},{"id":"law/law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webTitle":"Law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uksecurity","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"tone","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"politics/terrorism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Counter-terrorism policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/terrorism","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Mental health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/mental-health","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[],"description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

tweeted a link to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-fans-banned-from-wand-shop-for-not-being-real-wizards-a7177666.html\">a story in the Independent</a> about Richard Carter, owner of the shop Mystical Moments in Huddersfield. Carter, who supplies handmade wands, was quoted as saying that “Harry Potter is for children”, and that “if I had someone come in wanting a wand just because they liked Harry Potter I would not sell them one, no matter how much they were offering”.</p> <p>“You wouldn’t believe how many real witches and wizards there are knocking about. You would be amazed,” he said. “They know they can come here and reveal themselves without people thinking they’re mental. I don’t have customers who have been Harry Potterfied.” </p> <p>Rowling tweeted in response on Sunday: “Oh yeah? Well, I don’t think they’re real wands.” Her comment was liked by more than 15,000 people, but some criticised her on Twitter for making fun of pagan religions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/764756755368800256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh yeah?

The wands I make, though, whether you believe it or not, are real and spiritual. If a Harry Potter fan came to the shop, whether they would be able to buy a wand would depend on why they want one.

yes.”</p>","wordcount":"318","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-21T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qqp6","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/feaf3b3177c9f471c496140e23a4c77c95ccd83e/0_160_3000_1800/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/harrypotter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Harry

Thompson&#39;s widow, Anita (second to left), returned a pair of stolen elk antlers to the home of Ernest Hemingway in Ketchum, Idaho last week. The late writer stole the antlers from Hemingway’s home while on assignment for the National Observer in 1964. The antlers have hung at the Thompson&#39;s Owl Farm home in Woody Creek for the last 52 years. “Hunter later regretted this,” Anita wrote in an e-mail Sunday. “Hunter and I planned to take a road trip back to Ketchum and quietly return them. But we never did.” • #aspen #aspentimes #pitkincounty #colorado #local #news #hunterthompson #owlfarm #woodycreek #gonzo #journalism #ernesthemingway #literature #ketchum #idaho @natobserver</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by aspentimes (@aspentimes) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-08-10T18:51:48+00:00\">Aug 10, 2016 at 11:51am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Anita Thompson told Brandon Wenerd at BroBible that her late husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">who killed himself in 2005</a>, “had so much respect for Hemingway” and “was actually very embarrassed” by his actions.</p> <p>The couple had “planned to take a road trip and quietly return them, and not make a thing of it”, she said, but never did. This year, she got in touch with the Hemingway family, and earlier this month drove the antlers back to Ketchum – now owned by charity <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/idaho/placesweprotect/hemingway-preserve.xml\">the Nature Conservancy</a> – herself.</p> <p>“They were warm and kind of tickled … they were so open and grateful, there was no weirdness,” she told Wenerd, a long-time friend, of the Hemingway family’s reaction. “Still, it’s something that was stolen from the home. They were grateful to have them back. They had heard rumours. Sean Hemingway, the grandson, was the first family member that I’d heard from. He spoke with other Hemingway family members and he said that everyone agreed that he should have them. He lives in New York, where he curates a museum. So now that I’m back from Ketchum we’re actually shipping them to Sean.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

It’s as if concepts from organic chemistry were compressed into a Dutch genre painting depicting a scuzzy backyard in industrial New Jersey. Feinman’s awareness of the systems underlying observable phenomena is striking: he selects and deploys his images brilliantly, but the poem is often more structuralist than imagist.<br /></p> <p> It’s one of a batch of 39 previously unpublished poems written during the 1950s and now included in <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10686.html\">Corrupted into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman</a>. It’s a riveting collection by a poet who deserves to be better known. The problem is that Feinman published very little during his life: there was Preambles and Other Poems (OUP, 1964), which was then published with revisions as Poems by Princeton in 1990. The rest was a pointed silence.</p> <p> All the newly published poems are those of a young man, but they are in no way beginner’s pieces. Usefully for the new reader, they clarify some of Feinman’s preoccupations and affinities. He was never a Beat or a confessional poet: his early mentors were Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens. James Geary, editor of the previously unseen section of the book, and one-time student of Feinman, recalls that the Brooklyn-born college lecturer came from a long line of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews\">Litvak</a> Talmudic scholars. When he taught Milton, he approached the work as sacred text. </p> <p> Regarding his own poetry, Feinman was deeply humble, and even distrustful. The world might have been the problem, rather than the unreliable ways of words. The poem preceding Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is called Lament for the Coming of Spring, and coins the grimly memorable phrase, “helic hate”. Feinman’s “songs” are unconsoling and some seem inconsolable.</p> <p> This week’s poem begins: “The sun beating on his brain.” This “beating” may be creatively enriching; it’s certainly more benign than helic hate. “Brain” occurs three times in the poem, almost like a form of linguistic punctuation (there’s no conventional punctuation). Sun, cat, woodpile and flies surround this unnervingly exposed brain, the life cycles resembling a <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\">Yeatsian gyre</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/09/poem-of-the-week-wb-yeats\">Poem of the week: The Sorrow of Love by WB Yeats</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Yeats was important to Feinman. He’s present not only in the copper-fastened craft but in the way Feinman turns a beggared space into a repository of the more-than-temporal. It’s also possible that Feinman is following up a strand of Yeatsian mysticism with the puzzling assertion, “He holds three eternal parameters”. Could this be a reference to the Hindu concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a\">the Three Gunas</a>? </p> <p>The same phrase is <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMhwx6BTwQcC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=what+are+the+three+eternal+parameters?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XIjKw2a7PB&amp;sig=i0TeyhJb1LkT5FW4oNSeO6i51UA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW-5ya-rjOAhUsDsAKHcNGAqsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20are%20the%20three%20eternal%20parameters%3F&amp;f=false\">used by Dr S S Bhatti</a>, referring to the three architectural principles of the cosmos, Brahma (creation), Vishnu (sustenance) and Mahesh (destruction).</p> <p>Alvin’s sun, cat, man, woodpile and flies may represent these qualities, or partake of their symbolism to some degree: the human brain embodies (“holds”) them all. </p> <p> But Feinman moves quickly on from his parameters to matters of perception: “The habit of his eye repeats / The shapes he reifies.” The possessive pronoun here could refer to the cat but more probably refers to the protagonist summoned at the poem’s start. We know that the images we see enter the retina in two dimensions, but are “translated” into three by the brain. If this is what “the habit of his eye” and the “shapes he reifies” allude to, perhaps the “eternal parameters” triplicate foreshadows the three dimensions. </p> <p> The thought may be structuralist but the sounds are sensuous: we can hear the flies buzzing in the word “nauseous”, though it seems a transferred epithet: flies vomit as part of their digestive process and it’s not very likely that hot weather makes them feel sick. These lines have a dense murmur and dazzle like that of the hot backyard. </p> <p> The next two lines are isolated and fill the space around them with sombre, or at least fatalistic, portent. There’s a striking contrast between “silence” (a kind of negative image, a whiteness, with the power of salving “its own ache”) and “the plenum of a small red brain”. The blood-suffused brain-colour is significant, connecting intelligence to what is “red in tooth and claw”. Perhaps, too, because the brain is seen as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plenum\">a plenum</a>, the poem is telling us that there’s no way out of our own perception. The brain fits flush to the skull. Consciousness is basically organic structure and scarily inescapable.</p> <p> Decay is inherent in all this sun-bred life. The woodpile declines to “sticks”, the flies, since they “fall suppurant”, must have succumbed to swat or insecticide or natural death. Meanwhile the cat, stirred from its “slouching” doze, is ready for some action. The sensed distinction between cosmic, perhaps God-like creation using space and time, and the small mammalian attempt, which is the product of illusory mental freedom, and merely reproductive, seems to drag the poem back as it heaves itself towards a positive conclusion. The penultimate stanza (the most difficult two lines in a difficult poem) imagine, I think, free will and limitless action, almost conceive them as possibilities. But the optimism is scarred, and will be deeply qualified by that repeated “as though”. The glittering fact remains: the poem’s sonnet-size contains all the space and sun required for Feinman to shape and “make a world”.</p> <ul> <li>Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is excerpted from Corrupted Into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman by Alvin Feinman. © 2016 Princeton University Press.

celebrates his close friend’s sharp curiosity about nature, 10 years after his death","byline":"Terence Blacker","body":"<p>Swimming in the river Waveney on a sunny afternoon last weekend, it was difficult not to think of my good friend and neighbour Roger Deakin who died 10 years ago next Friday.</p> <p>Roger was an unusual man – wild, strong, uncompromising in the way he lived his life, with a sharp curiosity about nature and people. He was terrific, funny company and a loyal friend. With his first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/waterlog-2.html\"><em>Waterlog</em></a>, subtitled “A swimmer’s journey through Britain”, he found the perfect form for his view of the world: clear-eyed; subversive; informed; full of a sense of wonder but with a tug of melancholy beneath the surface of the prose.</p> <p>The book’s originality and charm found many readers, and Roger, who was never a vain man, reacted to its success with startled pleasure, rather as if an otter had made a surprise appearance at his moat.</p> <p>It seemed that a great, late-blooming literary career lay ahead of him, but he died from a brain tumour before his second book, <em>Wildwood</em>, was published. A book based on his notebooks, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/notes-from-walnut-tree-farm.html\"><em>Notes from Walnut Tree Farm</em></a>, was brought out in 2008.</p> <p>Soon after his death, it became clear that it was not just Roger’s writing that appealed to readers across the world; it was his character, his attitude to the environment, the way he lived, what he was thought to represent.</p> <p>Essays and editorials were published in praise of him. He was said to be a pioneer of something called “new nature writing”. A one-man play about him was written. There was talk of a book – “not so much a biography as a celebration”.</p> <p>Then there was the backlash. There have been brutally funny parodies of the style of writing Roger is thought to have influenced. New nature has been dismissed as a marketing wheeze.</p> <p>Maybe this grim process of chatter and myth-making is inevitable when a distinctive writer dies before his or her time. It must have happened with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\">Plath</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/bruce-chatwin\">Chatwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">Foster Wallace</a> and others. But the effect it has is to smooth off the interesting rough corners of a life, replacing a real, complicated person with a shiny icon. It is my small personal wish that Roger’s books will be read by even more people over the next decade, but without the attendant noise and silliness of literary celebrity.</p>","wordcount":"389","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T16:33:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qetp","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cfb511b02622dccf2a972d8956d5103fdd9bb5/141_649_2080_1247/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","byline":"Ben Myers","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/455m8"},"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jamesbaldwin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Baldwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamesbaldwin","references":[]},{"id":"books/franzkafka","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Franz Kafka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/franzkafka","references":[]},{"id":"books/fyodordostoevsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benmyers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Myers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benmyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benmyers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Myers is an author and journalist.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","byline":"Michelle Dean","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","wordcount":"3166","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/45xtn"},"tags":[{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/ohio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Ohio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/ohio","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michelle-dean","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michelle Dean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michelle-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michelle-dean","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michelle Dean is a critic and journalist based in New York</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Columnist/Head_shots/2014/11/19/1416432311450/Michelle-Dean-003.jpg","firstName":"michelle","lastName":"dean"}],"elements":[{"id":"cb6b20b56055d09e0be1ccc10c273e0536d24694","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608386967/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"altText":"Malarkey family","caption":"In a photo from January 2009, Beth Malarkey covers up her son, Alex, after surgery as Alex’s father, Kevin, watches.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it?

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

Castle","byline":"Maev Kennedy","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"439","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44pzh"},"tags":[{"id":"culture/heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[],"bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142224016/Maev-Kennedy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142245982/Maev-Kennedy-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kennedy"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","wordcount":"1024","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44ev3"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum selects the definitive 100 novels written in English"},{"id":"books/malcolm-lowry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Malcolm Lowry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malcolm-lowry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/malcolm-lowry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Murder, intrigue and a beguiling protagonist make <strong>Adam LeBor</strong>’s international thriller <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062330017/the-washington-stratagem\"><strong>The Washington Stratagem</strong></a> a gripping and enticing read.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Edpilkington\">@Edpilkington</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I’m both addicted to and critical of mystery novels. You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign. From the first sentence, Gay presents the reader with the one of the most visceral and haunting depictions of trauma on the female body and spirit.</p> <p><em><strong>Sarah Galo, open intern (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahEvonne\">@SarahEvonne</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/shining-girls-lauren-beukes-review\"><strong>Lauren Beukes’s The Shining Girls</strong></a> taught me how to love the suspense novel with its precise and powerful tale of a time-traveling serial killer and the rough, young female out to stop him. Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country. Accessible without conceding authority, hugely detailed without surrendering clarity or literary flair. A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

again","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut

When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains.

gap between what was said and what was done","byline":"Richard Coles","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","wordcount":"514","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448tj"},"tags":[{"id":"books/pdjames","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"PD
