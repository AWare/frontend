Book Collector by Alice Thompson review – elegant and shocking entertainment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T16:00:15Z","fields":{"wordcount":"682","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f29d","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Modern celebrity examples warn us that a marriage described as “fairytale” is usually anything but. What happens after “happily ever after” is a question addressed in Alice Thompson’s seventh novel, and a book of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytales provides the central motif.</p> <p>Orphaned Violet is approached at a cafe by a mysterious man who leaves, as if by chance, a business card for a second-hand bookshop called, with gothic appropriateness, Looking Glass. The first book Violet opens on arriving at the shop is an anatomy textbook with a drawing of a flayed woman. “The muscular tissue of the woman’s breasts were like the elaborate swirling of cartographic mountains.” “They’re just drawings,” she concludes, and replaces the volume on the shelf.</p> <p>The shop’s proprietor, Lord Archibald Murray, turns out to be the mysterious man from the cafe, and they swiftly marry. “Their romance had been like a fairytale. If only she could work out which fairytale it was, it would somehow help her.” Will it be <a href=\"http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/121/\" title=\"\"><em>The Red Shoes</em></a>, whose heroine is danced to death, punished by her worldly thoughts, or <a href=\"http://www.authorama.com/english-fairy-tales-29.html\" title=\"\"><em>Mr Fox</em></a>, whose wife is enjoined to “Be bold, be bold, but not too bold”? Or maybe it’s a modern tale, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/4\" title=\"\"><em>Rebecca</em></a>, with its saturnine hero obsessed with a dead wife and a ghastly secret.</p> <p><em>The Book Collector</em> is purportedly set in the Edwardian era, though I wouldn’t have guessed that without reading the blurb. Jarring elements include the liberal use of makeup, particularly plum lipstick, which sounds a bit Revlon for the period. Actually, the setting is simply “the past”, before cars and telephones, or widespread notions about women’s rights.</p> <p>If the male gothic tradition involves the violation of social norms and taboos by male will, in the female tradition the male transgressor becomes, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/27/gothic-fiction-divided-selves\" title=\"\">Alison Milbank</a> puts it in <em>The Handbook of Gothic Literature</em>, “the villain, whose authoritative reach as patriarch, abbot or despot, seeks to entrap the heroine … [threatening] death or rape.” Of course Archie can’t legally rape his wife, but does something horrifying lurk under his bland smile?</p> <p>The gothic genre is known for its florid language, as well as liberal use of motifs such as the cave, the isolated house, the asylum and the forbidden text, all present here. But Thompson’s style is largely plain, unadorned, matter-of-fact, as Violet struggles to hold on to her sanity and distinguish reality from illusion. She is an appealing heroine and not just a suffering cypher, able to make sharp observations about the people around her, before laudanum and medical procedures take the sting out of her soul. For one thing, she is sensual, eagerly pursuing her own pleasure, curious about male and female bodies.</p> <p>One of her observations concerns the orderliness of all about her. The doctors and her husband have the world sewn up between them. “Was there a hidden system to her marriage she hadn’t realised, also?” The masculine world may be coherent and logical, she realises, but there is not enough room in it for emotion, intuition and humanity.</p> <p>In the room of a sinister stranger, Violet contemplates a stuffed fox who, while not the kind of talking animal we meet in fairytales, still has something crucial to impart: “He looked alert, but for the fact he was dead.” Her husband, who loves physical books much more than the ideas in them, is dead at the core.</p> <p><em>The Book Collector</em> is an exercise in using traditional tropes and leaving whopping clues lying around, while still creating unease and suspense. Perhaps Thompson resolves and reveals too much at the end – I like to be left in doubt, myself – but she has created an elegant and bloodily shocking entertainment.</p> <p>• To order <em>The Book Collector </em>for £7.19 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/349644/s/the-book-collector/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

We ended up having to make some tough decisions, between the Vita Brits and the marshmallows, the pita bread and the jam doughnuts, the muesli and the chips. I’m ashamed to say what won in each case...</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tomorrow-when-the-war-began.html\">Tomorrow, When the War Began</a>, James Marsden</strong></p> <p><strong>---</strong></p> <p> When I was little, our holidays were often spent on campsites. We would pile into the car, packed tightly with a tent, boxes of food, fishing rods and our togs (swimming costumes). Then we’d be off – on another adventure, as my stepfather would say – for a week on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stradbroke_Island\">Stradbroke Island</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island\">Fraser Island</a>, or at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cootharaba\">Lake Cootharaba</a>. More often than not, our cousins or friends were in the car behind us. Once there, we’d set up our home away from home, each family’s tent pointing towards a big communal cooking area, with space to light a fire and set up folding chairs and rugs for mealtimes. They were magical holidays. Most excitingly, we’d be able to eat food not normally on the table at home. As children who didn’t often have sweets back in Brisbane, we’d look forward to the seemingly endless supply of marshmallows, toasted one by one over the fire.</p> <p> Marshmallow toasting was my favourite camping ritual. We’d spend ages searching for the perfect marshmallow stick, before peeling the bark off the end, sharpening it to 3mm in diameter, and rubbing it clean(ish). You need one that’s long enough to keep you safe from the flame, but short enough for you to retain control of the marshmallow; a fine balance to strike. Of course, if you’re not close to fallen branches, a skewer could act as a very suitable stick substitute. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e55eb676d3e554391384bf588e454503dbdff943\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e55eb676d3e554391384bf588e454503dbdff943/0_0_2316_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘This first layer will inevitably burn your mouth slightly before you have to rush to capture the gooey innards in a second bite, in a bid to prevent them falling straight into the dirt.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Once you’ve placed a marshmallow on the end of your stick, everyone has a different toasting preference. I vacillate. Occasionally I like dancing it in and out of the coolest flames at the edge of the fire, browning it only slightly. More often than not, though, I will stick it straight in the middle of the flames, just above the wood, and pull it out less than a minute later once it is bubbling and black. However you cook it, if you leave the marshmallow for long enough, the whole outer layer comes off in a crisp, caramelised shell. This first layer will inevitably burn your mouth slightly before you have to rush to capture the gooey innards in a second bite, in a bid to prevent them falling straight into the dirt.</p> <p> It’s just this that I imagine happening to the marshmallows that make it through the food cull above. In case this book is new to you (I know of no Australians my age who are unfamiliar with Marsden’s most famous story, but the books are less prolifically read in other parts of the world), it features a group of seven teenage friends who discover, on returning home from a camping trip, that their small country town has been invaded by a foreign army. Tomorrow, When the War Began is the first of seven books; the group spends the rest of the series trying, with varying success, to fight against the invasion while their families and friends are held in camps.</p> <p> It’s an extraordinary series for young adults (and, I suspect, older adults too), giving just as much weight to the psychological effects of the war as to the physical fighting. I hadn’t read it in years, but spotted a copy in <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/\">Powell’s Books</a> when I was in Portland recently. I started to flick through it and was reminded of just how voraciously my sister Lucy and I had consumed the books when we were younger. She, her husband and I all instantly remembered the moment where the group chose marshmallows over Vita Brits, a choice we would have made too. We made immediate plans to toast marshmallows a couple of days later, on their roof.</p> <p> <strong>A note: </strong>Marshmallows are, of course, better toasted over a burning flame in a campsite, but I have stood with a couple of them on a skewer over a gas hob too, as well as employing a blowtorch to do the job. So do read below for the recipe – don’t spend the next five months waiting for summer and barbecues to reappear in the northern hemisphere. These are ideal in hot chocolate too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e1e4f9f15458c24e41539a0341bc390d57207f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/04e1e4f9f15458c24e41539a0341bc390d57207f/0_0_2794_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don’t wait for the summer ...

Stir, then leave to sit while you get on with the rest of the recipe.</p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Put the caster sugar, glucose syrup and salt into the saucepan, along with the other 125ml water. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar at the start, but ensuring you stop before it begins to boil, or it will crystallize. Boil until it reaches 116C or ‘soft ball stage’, when the syrup will form a ball/clump if dribbled into a glass of cold water, and will hold its shape for a moment out of the water. </p> <p><strong> 3 </strong>While you are waiting for this to happen (it always takes a while to start and then happens all at once, so don’t turn your back on it) you can prepare the tin/tray. Rub a tiny amount of oil around it, then line the base and sides with aluminium foil. Mix the cornflour with the icing sugar in a bowl. Sprinkle a few tablespoons into the lined tin, then turn it around, tapping it, to ensure the powder covers the base and sides. Tip the excess back into the bowl for later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> 4</strong> Once the sugar syrup is at 116C, remove the saucepan from the heat. Turn the mixer onto a medium speed then slowly pour the syrup down the side of the bowl into the softened gelatine, ensuring you don’t pour it onto the whisk, or you will end up with spun sugar. Once you have added all the syrup, turn the speed up to the highest, and whisk for around 12 - 15 minutes, until the mixture is very stiff, full of air, and the bowl has cooled. This 12 minutes is proper alchemy; I was sure mine hadn’t worked, as it was a sloppy liquid for the first few minutes, but I kept beating and it puffed up like a big white cloud. Once it is stiff and thick, add the vanilla, and a little bit of food colouring if you’d like pink marshmallows.</p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Working relatively quickly, pour the marshmallow mix into the lined tin. Mine was a little tricky to manipulate at this point and didn’t move into the corners of its own accord. To help it along, wet your spatula and push it, flattening the top as you do. Sprinkle the top with more of the cornflour and icing sugar mix and leave it to rest at room temperature for at least four hours, or overnight if that works for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"288e42c2811f735b1b28f0d81991695fdfb74773\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/288e42c2811f735b1b28f0d81991695fdfb74773/0_0_2295_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘We’d set up our home away from home, each family’s tent pointing towards a big communal cooking area, with space to light a fire and set up folding chairs and rugs for mealtimes.’’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6</strong> The next day, cut your marshmallow block into cubes. Dust your knife with the cornflour and icing sugar between cuts to combat the stickiness, and roll the finished marshmallows in the powder too.

The public library is the only thing in my neighbourhood that is free, and it looks that way: dowdy, with grey carpet, half-empty fiction shelves and a librarian who is not in the business of wishing anyone a nice day. When you listen closely, the silence of the reading room is actually white noise produced by half a dozen nervous people rustling in their seats.</p> <p>I’d forgotten about the effect of all of this, how wonderfully and militantly library culture stands out against every other service in the neighbourhood; how mind-blowing it is to walk into a place and not be beamed at by a maniac or asked to take part in a commercial transaction.</p> <p>The downside to the library, one that Amazon and its ilk have capitalised on for years, has always been the inconvenience. It is easier to order and pay for a book online than to trek to your local branch only to find the book you want isn’t there. (If you’re insane, which a fair number of people who live around here are, there’s another downside, which is hygiene. I know mothers in Manhattan who won’t take out library books for their kids because of the risk of catching “germs”, or “bed bugs” from the circulating collection.)</p> <p>It turns out that, during my five-year hiatus, the convenience argument has expired. The <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/\" title=\"\">New York Public Library</a> system has made it fantastically easy to order any book directly from your computer. There is a phone app, and an app for downloading ebooks. The half-empty shelves are irrelevant given that you can put a hold on any book in the entire New York system and it will be delivered to your branch within days. This week, I went on a half-hysterical borrowing frenzy and ordered Anne Enright’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/03/the-green-road-anne-enright-review-exquisite-collage\" title=\"\">The Green Road</a>, Karen Joy Fowler’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/completely-beside-ourselves-family-love-review\" title=\"\">We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</a>, the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/14/ted-hughess-widow-criticises-offensive-biography\" title=\"\">Ted Hughes biography</a>, a book about Chernobyl and Asne Seierstad’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/09/historybooks.features\" title=\"\">The Angel of Grozny. </a>Then I took my kids to the children’s section upstairs, where there are play mats and huge windows and a librarian who is very cross, all of the time, particularly if you try to feed your child a snack without her seeing. After almost 10 years in New York, I’ve never felt so at home.</p> <h2><strong>Shake, rattle and roll</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/10/christmas-out-of-office-email-facebook-twitter\">What do I want for Christmas? To go back to out-of-office time, please | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When my kids aren’t in the library, they’re at an exorbitantly overpriced indoor play area with no windows, where once a week a guitarist in his 30s runs a music class for babies. He has a drummer and a keyboard player, and together they play covers of Bon Jovi and Aerosmith while the babies ignore them or try to eat bits of carpet.</p> <p>I find myself wondering about this man’s interior life, the way one does with children’s entertainers. He isn’t sinister; he’s very nice. He does, however, have a homemade tattoo of the words “love and rage” on the inside of his forearm, which I assume harks from an era when a different kind of music career still beckoned. During a cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc\" title=\"\">Wonderwall</a> last week, several of the mums sang along, gently swaying to and fro and mouthing the lyrics in a way that made me feel simultaneously very happy and very sad. I saw the guitarist looking at us and for a split second, wondered about the rage part of “love and rage”. The moment passed.</p> <h2><strong>Spring rites and wrongs</strong></h2> <p>The winter heatwave in New York is finally coming to an end, but not before the whole city turned up in Central Park at the weekend dressed in T-shirts to hang out in the sun. Basing observations about the natural world on the behaviour of random pigeons is, I suspect, the naturalist’s equivalent of a journalist quoting a taxi driver as a test of public opinion, but I’m just saying: the pigeons on my terrace were nesting all week and at the weekend had wild pigeon sex. That has to be because they think it’s spring, right?</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The 21st-century argument against this great public service was inconvenience.

I think this is mistaken. The nature of evil in the first three films (when I say “first three”, I mean the first three films to be made: I am not in the business of pandering to a fictional chronology) is very broad, using tropes and images from the Bible to the mafia. At the start of 1977’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36316/star.wars\"><em>A New Hope</em></a>, the political aim of the Empire is the suppression of remote systems by fear – being able to unwind local structures of central enforcement is actually a sign that the reign of terror is working well. It reminds me a little bit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> and the “northern powerhouse”, but it doesn’t really suggest Nazism, with its extermination of the other. Darth Sidious – instrumentally paranoid in the service of greed – is more like Herod than Hitler.</p> <p>Yet, just as the eyeliner in <em>Cleopatra </em>roots the film far more evocatively in 1963 than in 30BC, so the nature of good and evil in <em>Star Wars</em> is revealed by the small details. The six films so far constitute a highly unusual cultural resource: you can see how concepts such as nobility, meritocracy, class, equality and dignity have changed over time, by the way they are reflected in George Lucas’s work.</p> <p>So, initially, the distinction of the Jedi knight isn’t that he comes from a superior class, but that he is an abstract thinker in a world of concrete thinkers. In the first film to be made, the Force isn’t hereditary. Nothing is hereditary until Darth Vader is revealed as Luke’s father in the second film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36327/empire.strikes.back\"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></a><em> </em>(1980), but Lucas explicitly said after the release of <em>A New Hope</em> that the Force was “Like yoga. Everybody can do it. It’s just the Jedi who take the time to do it. If you want to take the time to do it, you can do it; but the ones that really want to do it are the ones who are into that kind of thing.” This he was able conveniently to ignore later on, when the theme of lineage had become so strong as to be defining.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8316a7e33385f337cc318ab385f0bb558b5919f8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8316a7e33385f337cc318ab385f0bb558b5919f8/0_196_3504_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Force Awakens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Boyega, Peter Mayhew and Harrison Ford in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strength, in the beginning, is inextricably linked with higher feeling, sensitivity, empathy – “stretch out your feelings”, Obi-Wan tells Luke Skywalker, as if concentration were its own superpower. Han Solo is shown as a contrast, but he isn’t a person of lower birth so much as of lesser mind – essentially conveyed by his cupidity, and his lack of ambition for anything other than money. The Jedi ideology is meritocratic: anyone can be a higher being, though this will be self-selecting to a degree, since only higher beings are going to work at it. It’s a rather elegant balancing system: the higher beings are marked out by their superior ability to feel, which in itself prevents them feeling superior, since they empathise with the inferior. What marks them out from the crowd, in other words, is what binds them back to it.</p> <p>By the time of the third film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36340/return.of.the.jedi\"><em>Return of the Jedi</em></a>, made in 1983, the hereditary aspect has been established. Luke tells Leia that the Force is strong in his family; now the nature of the gift has fundamentally changed and the Jedi become quasi-aristocratic. Lucas takes up this notion and goes wild with it, in 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, when he decides that the quality of the Jedi is actually measurable in units known as midichlorians via a simple blood test. Young Anakin, before he becomes Darth Vader, breaks all known records with more than 20,000. Luke and Leia are generally assumed to have identical midichlorian counts, being twins. The next highest after Anakin, though, is Darth Sidious. And so the Force is now an amoral physical property, whereas previously it was a mental property – thought itself, the source of empathy and therefore, arguably, the source of morality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Han Solo isn’t a person of lower birth so much as of lesser mind – he lacks ambition for anything other than money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only is the democratic foundation of the Jedi undermined by this new idea of them as thoroughbreds; Jedi legitimacy, if not eroded, is at least problematised: you start to get a load of slightly chinless self-justification from the order. “I didn’t actually come here to free slaves,” says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/liam-neeson\">Liam Neeson</a> as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, like a person to whom a huge number of vexing tasks has been subcontracted.</p> <p>By <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, three years later in 2002, the Jedi have a kind of UN blue helmets mandate – “You must realise there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers,” says Mace Windu, apropos some urgent battle or other. Now we’re in a postmodern, post-heroism landscape, where good and evil still exist, but good is on the clock and evil has all day.</p> <p>It was noted in 1977 that <em>A New Hope</em>, both in its tone and in its reception, represented a kind of wish-fulfilment after Vietnam, the rebuilding of shared moral absolutes after a visceral pasting. Two decades on, a sad adaptation to a new reality had taken place, where the living incarnation of all that is noble – the Jedi – are critically limited by the rather limp and indecisive democracy that governs them. This is inevitable, if the highest beings are aristocrats but the highest stated value is democracy. The ideas that all citizens share the dignity of being born equal, and the best among them are more equal than the others, are simply incompatible. This explains why the goodies are suddenly so complicated while the baddies’ motivation is intact and as strong as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070e523d3e8acc758c711a3ef0b048e8111a7ee5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/070e523d3e8acc758c711a3ef0b048e8111a7ee5/0_0_2394_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fussiness of the R2-D2/C-3PO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The fussiness of the C-3PO/R2-D2 relationship makes them the most three-dimensional characters of the lot.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could say this was simply a plot exigency, since why would so many key players move to the dark side, if the side of light weren’t just a tiny bit dysfunctional? But I think it’s actually rather an acute reflection of the post-ideological politics of the 21st century: egalitarian values are vaunted but equality is not pursued, since the essence of modernity is that it is post‑historical, directionless, has nowhere left to go. Naturally, though, it is going somewhere, towards refeudalisation, as intensifying wealth concentration is post-hoc justified by a kind of neo-Georgian notion that some people are intrinsically better than others. Undermined by the inconsistency, the culture cannot confidently express itself, and fixates instead upon enemies who are bound to be stronger because they know who they are.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why would so many key players move to the dark side, if the side of light weren’t just a tiny bit dysfunctional?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The classic Jedi response to subservience can be seen in the contrast between Luke’s first meeting with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/the-secrecy-has-been-ludicrous-star-wars-actor-anthony-daniels-on-the-new-film-and-his-life-as-c-3po\">C-3PO</a> – “I see, Sir”; “You can call me Luke”; “I see, Sir Luke,”; “No, just Luke” – and Qui-Gon Jinn meeting Jar Jar Binks: “Mesa your humble servant”; “That won’t be necessary”. Qui-Gon Jinn is impatient, imperious and patronising, while Luke is, above all, humble. He has no reason not to be, since at this point he is just an indifferent farmer, but it still foreshadows his knight-personality, which is more of a jiu jitsu, strength-through-attentiveness affair than a born-to-rule act of self-assertion.</p> <p>There is a species-supremacy subplot between humans and droids, with droids not allowed in bars. Opinion is divided: this either conjures up the civil rights injustices that were so recent in 1977, or can be seen as a perfectly legitimate decision by bar owners, since droids take up space and they don’t drink. I lean towards the first interpretation. If a director can invent a droid, he can invent a droid cocktail made of oil. The fussiness of the R2-D2/C-3PO relationship makes them the most three-dimensional characters of the lot; portraying them as beings with the same feelings as humans but fewer rights invites the viewer to reconsider how hierarchies were formed and commonalities established.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b9a1098d12c8b9c90ac0b7fcee3c80668311d0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e5b9a1098d12c8b9c90ac0b7fcee3c80668311d0/0_113_3504_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwendoline Christie, Domhnall Gleeson and Adam Drive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domhnall Gleeson and Adam Driver in Star Wars: The Force Awakens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the original trilogy was pretty evolved in gender terms, if not at all diverse, the later three films are rife with stereotypes. Jar Jar Binks is famous for the tang of racism in his conception – his accent is plainly Jamaican, or Jafaican, if you prefer – and there’s a forelock-tugging slave-subtext that is crass because it’s unaddressed. Sure, have slaves, if they’re going to have dignity and fight for their own agency – like Anakin, for instance. But borrowing the cliches of a slave portrayal, and draping them over a character who is basically a bit thick, lacks the sophistication that one associates with Lucas. Then there’s Viceroy Nute Gunray, who is considered by some to have a Chinese accent, and to be a slur on the nation for its money-grabbing, market-fixated nature.</p> <p>Nonetheless, in the quiddity of the Jedi you can see a director who was alive to the change in the political culture and its profound but rarely discussed shifts. If only Lucas could have carried on for ever, we might have been able to carry on using this franchise to plot the changing century. I get the sense with JJ Abrams that he’s mainly interested in people jumping off vehicles that are still moving.</p> <ul> <li><em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> is on general release.<br /></li> </ul>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"It may have lightsabers, stormtroopers and fussy droids, but George Lucas’s Star Wars saga is in fact an acute reflection of the politics of the 21st century.

She took her life away because she was tired of the world but more specifically she had 13 reasons to not live. Before she dies she recorded her reasons in tapes and mailed it. Clay Jensen does not want to listen to the tapes that he received after her death. He does not want to know her secret. But as soon as he discovers that these tapes list the reasons why certain people are a part of her death, he feels responsible for it and therefore continues to listen. All night he listens to Hannah and, understanding her reasons, he visits places and tries to feel things or maybe just look at the world from her point of view.</p> <p>Thirteen Reasons Why has a very different presentation. I really appreciate the layout of the book. If the book was entirely written in the same font I would get confused between Hannah and Clay’s thoughts which would have been confusing and inconvenient. I like how symbols are used to represent the emotions of the story and it is a very different concept to me; I have never actually read a book with symbols. I think symbols made the book slightly more interesting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"41766da91159b3265dc7c85b2adac6dad9fb6f29\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/41766da91159b3265dc7c85b2adac6dad9fb6f29/0_6_260_390/260.jpg\" alt=\"fd\" width=\"260\" height=\"390\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think a lot of people believe that this story is not a happy ending love story. I don’t think I can fully argue on that point but from my understanding I have come to a conclusion that in the end both the people developed a kind of understanding between each other. Hannah was dead but she understood the actions of Clay and Clay’s life took an unexpected turn which changed him forever after listening to Hannah. Even though Hannah is dead, I think this was a happy ending. It is because that is how it is supposed to be. Clay’s life has been impacted for the better; Hannah changed it; it is good. That is why I think it wasn’t an unhappy ending – not exactly happy, but not clichéd either. </p> <p>So I am concluding that this book is a great piece of art. It not only recites us a story of a girl who died and a boy that lived with pain but also taught us some social lessons. Major issues such a bullying, anxiety, abuse, suicide and other teenage problems are dealt with with great delicacy. And every word of this book holds great significance in real life. But I think the one main lesson Jay Asher wanted to convey was that suicide is never the answer.

Christian Andersen’s fairytale about the nightingale that sings for the Emperor of China has been sold at auction to an American collector for £32,000.</p> <p>By the acclaimed Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen, the image was painted in 1923 to illustrate The Nightingale in a collection of Andersen’s stories published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1924. Works by Nielsen, who is also known for <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/hanselgretelothe00grimrich#page/20/mode/2up\">his illustrations of the Brothers Grimm fairytales</a> but who died in poverty in 1957, are very rare, according to Chris Albury at Dominic Winter Auctioneers. Dominic Winter, which is auctioning the painting, called Nielsen “one of the greatest illustrators of the golden age of book design and illustration in the first half of the 20th century”.</p> <p>“Fairytale watercolours by Nielsen rarely come on the market and we think that this is as good, or better, than any that have come up for sale in recent years,” said Albury. “It’s wonderfully translucent/vellucent and dripping in Chinese influence. Incredibly, Nielsen died in poverty and it’s really another case of posthumous world recognition arriving too late to feed the hungry artist.”</p> <p>The picture shows a Chinese girl standing under a willow tree by the river, listening to a nightingale sing – presumably the kitchen girl of Andersen’s story, who leads the Emperor of China’s staff to find the bird he is desperate to listen to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0b37ef666ed37e5cfabea4a72732b970cad5e976\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0b37ef666ed37e5cfabea4a72732b970cad5e976/0_0_2772_3756/738.jpg\" alt=\"Full image of Kay Nielsen’s 1923 illustration to Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale.\" width=\"738\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full image of Kay Nielsen’s 1923 illustration to Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I know it well; yes, indeed, how it can sing!” she says in the story, <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/andersen-nightingale/andersen-nightingale-00-h.html\">first published in 1843</a>. “Every evening I have leave to carry home leavings from the table to my poor sick mother. She lives down by the shore, and when I’m coming back and am tired and take a rest in the wood, I hear the Nightingale sing. The tears come in my eyes with it: it feels as if my mother was kissing me.”</p> <p>The Emperor decides he prefers the song of a mechanical bird to that of the real nightingale, and it is exiled. But when the Emperor is dying, and the mechanical bird has broken, the real nightingale sings for him again, and he recovers.</p> <p>“At that instant there was heard, close by the window, the most lovely song. It was the little live Nightingale that was sitting on the branch outside. It had heard of its Emperor’s need, and so had come to sing to him of comfort and hope: and as it sung, the forms became more and more shadowy. The blood coursed quicker and quicker through the Emperor’s weak body, and Death himself listened and said: ‘Go on, little Nightingale! Go on.’”</p> <p>The story is believed to have been inspired by Anderson’s unrequited love for the opera singer Jenny Lind, said Dominic Winter. Albury added that “Andersen himself had in his youth been known as the Nightingale of Funen, all of which adds another layer to the meaning of the picture”.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Watercolour by Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen sells for £32,000","headline":"Very rare Hans Christian Andersen

element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/nov/26/lorax-christmas-dr-seusss-old-vic-in-pictures\">How the Lorax saved Christmas: Dr Seuss hits the Old Vic – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the astonishing things about this children’s story by the prolific Theodor Seuss Geisel is its prescience: even in 1971, it was warning about the danger to the environment of unchecked capitalist growth. But this exhilarating adaptation by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/davidgreig\">David Greig</a>, with songs by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/05/noah-and-the-whale-interview\">Charlie Fink</a>, retains the original message without ever being preachy or pious. Its liberal spirit is balanced by a wonderful sense of impending anarchy.</p> <p>Greig stays true to the original fable. In ingeniously rhyming verse, he tells how the Once-ler was led into a betrayal of his friend, the Lorax, “a beavery thing” who speaks for the trees. Chancing upon the fruitful truffula tree, the antihero discovers its tufts yield a multipurpose product called a “thneed” for which there turns out to be a big market. Soon the Once-ler turns into a mad axeman chopping down whole forests and building factories in order to satisfy voracious demand. But, while the balance of nature is disturbed, the story offers a sliver of hope in a cryptic clue left by the bereft Lorax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9a674376420f2c4f621d89d0c3687a647e7041\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ea9a674376420f2c4f621d89d0c3687a647e7041/578_490_3740_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lorax by Dr Seuss at the Old Vic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Paisley Day (Once-ler) in The Lorax by Dr Seuss at the Old Vic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In adapting the story for the stage, Greig has enriched it by making the Once-ler infinitely more than a predatory villain. Played by Simon Paisley Day with a leaping enthusiasm and comic verve that inescapably reminds one of John Cleese, he is a naive dreamer sucked into the vortex of rampant consumerism. In this version, he is also a green-haired victim of his materialist family, trickster lawyers and a society that believes, in the spirit of Wall Street’s Gordon Gekko, that greed is good. One of Greig’s most telling inventions is a scene where Paisley Day, in a fashionable nod to transparency, invites the TV cameras in to his factories, only for them to be revealed as a source of smoggy pollution. The Once-ler also reminds us that if “we biggered your cars and freezers and fridges”, it was because the world demands constant growth. </p> <p>While Greig has lent the fable a measure of ambivalence, what enchants is the inventiveness of Fink’s music, Finn Caldwell’s puppetry, Rob Howell’s designs and Max Webster’s production. The songs cover every style from political protest to Motown mashup, with Melanie La Barrie buoyantly leading a Supremes-style number appealing to the Once-ler’s desire for greatness. The Lorax, artfully manipulated by Simon Lipkin, Laura Cubitt and Ben Thompson, is also an infinitely beguiling, droopy-moustached creature with the faint pathos of the liberal optimist. Rob Howell also excels himself with designs that range from the rainbow-hued beauty of the towering truffula trees to the monstrosity of the Once-ler factory, where the automatic knitters spew out filthy gloop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a03efa0239eac6b2fbfa590e52364b9ef1486bd5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a03efa0239eac6b2fbfa590e52364b9ef1486bd5/161_319_3362_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lorax by Dr Seuss at the Old Vic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lorax by Dr Seuss at the Old Vic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, the show appeals to our imagination without, like one or two seasonal entertainments, sating it. It also points out a moral without hitting us over the head with its good intentions. One of Greig’s cleverest touches is to show the Once-ler, in a sop to ecological protest, creating a nature reserve that will coral the animals while simultaneously announcing “You want five million thneeds for the people of Sweden? We’ll make those thneeds and some more if you need em!” In its mixture of verbal wit and social purpose, this is the best family show since Matilda.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/the-lorax/\">At Old Vic, London,</a> until 16 January.

come across Alice in Wonderland they tend to think it’s about fantasy and fairies and a book for babies. However, if they actually, bit by bit, turn the pages they will experience the bravery of Alice, the amusement of the Mad Hatter and the hatred of the Red Queen; they will find that this book is for anyone big or small, tall or short.<br /></p> <p>My favourite character was… Yes, after this you will hate me!… The Red Queen! I just loved the fact that she was hilarious as well as bossy and unfair (a bit like my mum!). Overall, I rate this book 9/10. Amazing. Loved it. I’m not a BIG fan of adventure stories but I loved this book.

in the Head by Ian MacDonald – from me to you","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T12:00:04Z","fields":{"wordcount":"744","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f3gy","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The most pleasurable gifts to give are the ones you would most like to receive, but it doesn’t necessarily follow that your favourite books are the ones you should give to others. I’ve had to learn this lesson repeatedly, the most recent occasion being earlier this year, in my local bookshop, when I handed the bookseller a copy of David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.</p> <p>“Great book,” she said, “you’re going to love it.”</p> <p>“Oh I’ve read it,” I said, “this copy’s for a friend.”</p> <p>She paused, the book halfway into a bag. “You’re,” she stammered, her voice a mixture of scorn and amazement, “you’re giving someone Infinite Jest as a present?”</p> <p>Her reaction, I soon realised, was entirely justified. Yes, the person I was buying Infinite Jest for loves tennis; yes, we met the same year the novel was published, as students at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where David Foster grew up; and yes, I think it’s a book that everyone should read. But as a gift idea it was – and is – horrible. If you’re going to embark on a 1,079-page novel with a difficult reputation and tiny type, you want to do it under your own volition. What you don’t want is to have it thrust into your hands in a crowded pub by someone who tells you that if you persevere past page 300 then yes, trust me, the whole thing will click.</p> <p>This Christmas, to atone, I’m giving that same person Ian MacDonald’s Revolution in the Head, a book I know will deliver lasting, but also – importantly – immediate pleasure. The book’s concept is simple and ingenious: miniature essays about every song the Beatles recorded, from 1961’s My Bonnie to 1970’s I Me Mine.</p> <p>“Close examination in context” is MacDonald’s description of his approach, which he delivers on brilliantly. No ploughing through to page 300 here: open the book anywhere and you’ll find something fascinating. In fact, you can happily start at page 300, with I Want You (She’s So Heavy): “Beneath their often viciously hurtful attacks on each other, the Beatles were still psychologically locked together at a deep level.” Open at random, get hooked, and devour the whole thing in any order you like.</p> <p>Part of the book’s immediacy is down to MacDonald’s talent for aperçus. Consider his description of how Love Me Do’s rawness stood out from quaint contemporary British sounds “like a bare brick wall in a suburban living room”, or his assertion that Revolution 9, the musique concrète experiment from the White Album, is “the world’s most widely distributed avant-garde artefact”. He is also capable of analysing songs from an ethical perspective as well as a musicological one. Thus the “sour A minor melody” of Glass Onion, a song that plays self-referential games with numerous strands of the band’s mythology, is one facet of the song’s “unlikeable” attitude: “Whether or not Lennon was fed up with being a Beatle, there was no excuse for berating those of their fans who had trustingly fallen for the group’s multi-layered conceptual jokes”. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80281db4d2bf1ee611b2b5ec52cebcbb55597c63\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/80281db4d2bf1ee611b2b5ec52cebcbb55597c63/0_215_1653_1321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The recording of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, in the Abbey Road studio in January 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967, with producer George Martin (centre).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/ Apple Corps Ltd/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his preface, MacDonald states the book’s aim “to replace gushing hero-worship with a detached, posterity-anticipating tally of what the Beatles did”, a stance exemplified by his concluding lines on the Lennon ballad Because: “Many have admired the song’s mood of visionary detachment without taking account of the heroin then flowing coldly around its composer’s body”.</p> <p>At times, when he’s describing the guitar Paul McCartney used to play the “fiercely angular slide guitar solo” on Drive My Car (an Epiphone Casino “first used on the coda of Ticket to Ride”), or the exact point on Within You Without You that George Harrison can be heard “softly counting in the tabla player” (3:46), you sense there is no detail that escaped MacDonald’s attention. Perhaps, if his book had not been published in 1994 but a few years later, MacDonald might have even had space in the entry for Harrison’s I Want to Tell You to note that the song’s lyrics form part of a conversation between Hal and Orin Incandenza on page 32 of Infinite Jest.</p> <p>As it stands, my friend will have to put that one together himself – if he ever gets as far as page 32.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Every little thing is a gem in Ian MacDonald’s mini-essay collection about the songs of the Fab Four, writes <strong>Chris

(The name, incidentally, is simply a set of letters that don’t appear in any English words in that order, so are easy to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/#q=XKCD\" title=\"\">Google</a>.) Drawn in a simple, elegant and clean style, it tells jokes for people who know something about science and maths. It’s delightful, good-humoured and never talks down to its readers; the opposite, if anything. There are comic strips with mathematical symbols, strips containing programming code, strips where you really need to know what a “clockwise polar plot” is to understand the joke. If that all seems a bit challenging, there is even an “<a href=\"http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" title=\"\">Explain XKCD</a>” site, which walks you through the science, technology or general knowledge needed to “get” each of Munroe’s jokes. Part of the point is that you learn a little.</p> <p>Of course, explaining jokes is a task fraught with danger, but here goes. One of XKCD’s most popular strips was titled “Up-Goer Five”; a diagram of the 1960s Saturn V rocket <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1133/\" title=\"\">explained</a> in simple terms. It’s both good science – it really does show how the rocket works – and funny, partly because of the limitations and bathos of the language. “Another thing that is a bad problem,” the diagram tells us, “is if you’re flying toward space and the parts start to fall off your space car in the wrong order. If that happens, it means you won’t go to space today, or maybe ever.”</p> <p>And now this concept has a book of its own. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/344577/s/thing-explainer/\" title=\"\"><em>Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words</em></a> is an illustrated “how things work” book. Munroe’s beautiful, <em>ligne</em> <em>claire</em>-style illustrations are perfect for this task: you can pick out the tiny individual chairs in a recreation room on an oil rig, or the parcels in the hold of a tall ship. He has chosen a diverse range of things to explain: from helicopters to a human cell, from the table of elements to the machines in a hospital room. And there’s that gimmick from “Up-Goer Five”: the book is written using only the top thousand (or “ten hundred”) words most commonly used in the English language.</p> <p>At some points, this produces passages of such startling clarity that one forgets there was ever anything difficult to understand about these phenomena. Explaining why there are U-shaped tanks of water in the centre of skyscrapers, the caption reads: “This room is very carefully shaped so that when the building leans one way, the water runs the other way and hits the wall, pushing the building back up.” No jargon needed there; it’s precise, to the point and absolutely fascinating.</p> <p>At other times it’s harder to work out what’s going on. It took me a little too long to realise, from a diagram titled “Stuff in the Earth We Can Burn”, what the “stuff” is in this description of the product of a mine: “This is white stuff, like what we put on food to make it better (although we mostly get the kind we eat from drying out sea water).” Ohhhhhh, salt. Why didn’t you say so?</p> <p>But not saying so is part of the joke: the book has a cryptic crossword feel and it’s a joy to puzzle out what he’s talking about. Another well-loved <em>XKCD</em> strip involves “synonym movie titles”. Can you work the movie meant by The Jewellery God: The Jewellery Team? Or Tropical Boaters: Spooky Boat? If you thought it over and had a chuckle, then this is the book, and the webcomic for you.</p> <p>If there’s a technologically minded child in your family, <em>Thing Explainer</em> would be a wonderful gift and a great book to work through together, comparing these diagrams and simple-English explanations to the “proper names” you can easily find online. If you’re an adult who knows most of this stuff already, it’s a beautifully designed journey through the intricacies of daily life, which might still have some surprises in store.</p> <p>• Naomi Alderman’s <em>The Liar’s Gospel</em> is published by Viking.

Or at least, our popular view of it in modern culture. It is a story about transformation, and redemption, and as such set a precedent for so many Christmas stories since. Though a very early Dickens (he wrote it, depressingly, when he was 30) it still feels modern in its concerns about capitalism and poverty and the dehumanising effect of work and the healing power of kindness. I’m re-reading it again this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/16/how-i-made-father-christmas-by-raymond-briggs\">How I made: Raymond Briggs on Father Christmas</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/father-christmas-4.html\">Father Christmas</a> by Raymond Briggs</h2> <p>This book was very much in my mind when I was writing my own Father Christmas story. The great thing about this book is that is so different to so many Christmas books. The polar opposite in fact. While most Christmas books seek to reveal the magic in the everyday, this shows us the ordinariness behind the magic, and so is wickedly subversive.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/child-s-christmas-in-wales.html\">A Child’s Christmas in Wales</a> by Dylan Thomas</h2> <p>This book brings me to tears. The soft-eyed memories of warm, happy childhood Christmasses is in marked contrast to a lot of what we know about Thomas’s adult life, and reminds us of the power of Christmas as a symbol of innocence and wonder. It connects us back to the child we all left behind.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-women-24.html\">Little Women</a> by Louisa May Alcott</h2> <p>This is one of my favourite books, and features healthy doses of both Christmas and nostalgia, so I am putting it here. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/quiz/2015/apr/10/quiz-which-of-the-march-sisters-from-little-women-are-you\">Quiz: which of the Little Women are you?</a></strong></p> <h2>5. Holidays on Ice by David Sedaris</h2> <p>One of the funniest things in print. This is a collection of essays about Christmas. The first one, Santaland Diaries, is Sedaris’s take on working as an elf during holiday season at Macy’s department store and is painful in all the right ways. Another essay reviews the local school’s Christmas pageant with delightful mischief.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44c6bf140911fe1a12ddc46b8c6cb607f83e070d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/44c6bf140911fe1a12ddc46b8c6cb607f83e070d/0_133_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Snowman And The Snowdog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Snowman And The Snowdog - it wouldn’t be Christmas without the Snowman in some form or another...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/snowman-8.html\">The Snowman</a> by Raymond Briggs</h2> <p>Come on. It’s The Snowman. </p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dark-is-rising-2.html\">The Dark is Rising</a> by Susan Cooper</h2> <p>I utterly adored the Dark is Rising sequence as a child. A truly epic battle between good and evil, or rather between Light and Dark, and the second novel, called The Dark is Rising, is the festive one, but not in a warm, glowing sense. It is set in a freezing, snow-ravaged wintery world, far harsher than anything Narnia could offer. Will, the hero, must find the six “signs of the Light” – circles quartered by a cross in wood, bronze, iron, water, fire and stone – before twelfth night. An eternal classic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/dec/01/judith-kerrs-mogs-christmas-calamity-sainsburys\">Judith Kerr's Mog's Christmas Calamity – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mog-s-christmas.html\">Mog’s Christmas</a> by Judith Kerr </h2> <p>My children loved Mog, and Mog’s adventures with the Christmas tree will always remind me of those early Christmases with my children. The great thing about Mog is that she is a very real cat. And this is a very real Christmas. Judith Kerr is wonderful.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/letters-from-father-christmas-251616.html\">Letters from Father Christmas</a> by JRR Tolkien</h2> <p>I’m not the biggest Tolkien fan, I must admit, but I make an exception for his letters from the big man himself. These were letters Tolkien gave to his children every year, and tell wonderfully detailed little tales of life in the North Pole, about reindeer and fantastical polar bears. It’s magical.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-match-girl.html\">The Little Match Girl</a> by Hans Christian Andersen</h2> <p>This is one of the most poignant stories ever told, about a poor girl selling matches in the cold and dying from hypothermia. On New Year’s Eve the girl lights matches to warm herself and in the flame sees visions of a Christmas tree and a holiday feast. The ending is devastating, even though Andersen believed it to be a happy one, as the girl ends in heaven. But it is an unforgettable tale, about the power of imagination to warm us like fire, and fits the Christmas spirit perfectly in the sense of us needing light and hope amid the dark of winter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6ae92f326fc97fdc9f9a3b28dce53940a8a0313f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6ae92f326fc97fdc9f9a3b28dce53940a8a0313f/0_0_1656_2560/647.jpg\" alt=\"A Boy Called Christmas\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Boy Called Christmas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matt Haig’s first children’s book, Shadow Forest, won the Nestle/Smarties Prize and the Blue Peter Book of the Year Award.

Being in the witness protection program was always going to be difficult, changing identity and having to lie to everyone you meet. But it seems to be going alright except when it comes to Chet Falconer, the only person who she really struggles to pretend around. Despite Stella’s best efforts, danger is fast approaching. Will she have the strength to do the right thing? Even if it means losing the life she once had?</p> <p>Becca Fitzpatrick has been an author I’ve looked up to for a while now, ever since I picked up a copy of her amazing Hush, Hush series. To most this might make me seem a bit biased but honestly it made me a harsher critic. Normally after an author creates a masterpiece of a series, the rest of their work in my eyes doesn’t live up to the expectations I’ve built for them. Especially after the roller coaster of feels you catch from a series where you can connect with a character and their journey. This is certainly not the case with Dangerous Lies. The realistic characters, fast-paced action and a complex storyline that unravels as you read along, you won’t be able to put it down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\"

Bedside Guardian 2015, edited by Malik Meer review – ‘unique, touching, provocative’","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T07:30:12Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1002","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f3ym","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>As regular as Christmas – “It can’t be <em>The</em> <em>Bedside Guardian</em> already!” – here it is again, this unique, touching, provocative compendium that is at once an account of the year itself and of the Guardian’s year. 2015 (or more precisely autumn 2014 to autumn 2015) was a particularly vivid, unsettling year both for Britain and for the paper. In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\" title=\"\">Alan Rusbridger</a>’s 20-year tenure as editor came to an end and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/katharineviner\" title=\"\">Katharine Viner</a> took over. Rusbridger’s “Farewell to my readers” is, in a sense, the centrepiece of the book, unexpectedly affecting in its quietly spoken rejection of editorial imperialism and its parallel embrace of the changed post-internet relationship with readers. He identifies the current Guardian as having directly evolved out of the great Manchester original and the Scott Trust, set up by CP Scott, the first editor, of which Rusbridger will become chair in September 2016, as its foundation and the source of its independence. The trust has allowed it to create an identity that is beholden neither to proprietors nor political parties, but to a consciously developed worldview that permeates the entire organisation. A “kindly rival” took Rusbridger for lunch just after he had become editor, and told him that if he were ever absent, there were six assistant editors who had different views of what his paper should be. “If you take a day off, the building itself would produce the Guardian.”</p> <p>The year covered by the book has been a challenging one for the world, and in particular for those of us who share the Guardian’s sensibilities. Climate change continued apace, unchecked by wavering politicians, while deniers remained maddeningly vocal and undeterred; the Labour vote collapsed under Ed Miliband; the Syrian situation continued on its bloody path; immigrants in their hundreds of thousands clawed a desperate route to the perceived promised lands of Europe, Islamist gunmen assailed Paris, slaughtering 12 cartoonists (the subsequent attacks are not covered here); and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> swept to entirely unpredicted power, taking left, right and centre aback.</p> <p>Much of this is touched on in <em>The  Bedside Guardian</em>. As befits “this  extraordinary agent of reporting, argument, investigation, questioning and advocacy” (Rusbridger again, in his piece on climate change), the book comes at it from all sides. There are the expected certainties – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-krugman\" title=\"\">Paul Krugman</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion\" title=\"\">folly of austerity</a> is almost surreally doubt-free – as well as hard reportage from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-chulov\" title=\"\">Martin Chulov</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\" title=\"\">origins of Isis</a>, and striking analysis from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/06/marxist-theory-game-of-thrones-lannisters-bankers-sex-power-feudal-westeros-revolution\" title=\"\">fall of feudalism </a>as portrayed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\" title=\"\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>. Even more characteristic of the paper are the undecided pieces, full of doubt and paradox: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewilliams\" title=\"\">Zoe Williams</a> on the matter of Uber cars versus black cabs (no verdict); <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis\" title=\"\">Alexis Petridis</a>, on the harassed rump of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/01/gary-glitter-fans-paul-gadd-facebook\" title=\"\">Gary Glitter fans</a> (fascinated bewilderment); and, best of all, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland</a> on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\" title=\"\">Charlie Hebdo</a> (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/charlie-hebdo-cartoonists-paris-killers-fascist-death-cult\" title=\"\">“First they came for the cartoonists, then they came for the Jews”</a>), a piece of exquisitely complex soul-searching, uncomfortably unresolved. Freedland speaks for all of us.</p> <p>It is obviously impossible to include everything that makes the Guardian what it is. There is a feisty foreword by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/naomiklein\" title=\"\">Naomi Klein</a>, which focuses on the paper’s campaigning aspect, praising its courage – “in the face of the most urgent crises we face as a human family” – in declaring the unacceptability of what she calls “normalised abuses … of people, privacy and planet”. Malik Meer, the Guardian’s features editor, has made the selection, and there isn’t a single one of the more than 80 pieces that doesn’t engage and reward the attention. If I had a cavil, it would be the scant attention paid to the arts, an area in which the Guardian has outdone most of its competitors in maintaining broad and deep coverage, treating the theatre, books, art and music as if they were a crucial part of the discourse of our times. There is a sharp comment on the long-closeted prequel to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/harper-lee\" title=\"\">Harper Lee</a>’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/to-kill-a-mockingbird.html\" title=\"\"><em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em></a>, an elegant homage to the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/omar-sharif\" title=\"\">Omar Sharif</a>, a quizzical piece about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-murray\" title=\"\">Bill Murray</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nancybankssmith\" title=\"\">Nancy Banks-Smith</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/20/nancy-banks-smith-on-deirdre-barlow-anne-kirkbride-coronation-street\" title=\"\">magnificent obituary of Deirdre</a> from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\" title=\"\"><em>Coronation Street</em></a> – and that’s it. This is doubly disappointing: first, because of the quality of so much arts writing in the paper, and, second, because the book’s account of the year is incomplete without it.</p> <p>Meer ends the collection gloriously with a small masterpiece, “All Hail the Bearded One”, a speculative account by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-mullin\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin</a> of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/14/prime-minister-jeremy-corbyn-the-first-100-days\" title=\"\">Corbyn’s first 100 days in office</a>. It is both fantastical and profound, credibly outlining a series of unlikely events that result both in Corbyn’s election and the subsequent triumph of his administration. But the beauty of the piece is that it is predicated on an assumption of generosity, humanity and good humour on the part of the British electorate. It is in fact a masterly little example of that rare genre – utopian writing – and reminds us that the Guardian, for all it its progressiveness, technologically, politically and socially, is a newspaper deeply rooted in the utopian socialism of the end of the 19th century, which makes it both passionate and benevolent, a most uncommon combination. <em>The Bedside Guardian 2015</em> is also, of course, a book, celebrating within hard covers the most notoriously ephemeral branch of the profession of letters. It is a book that will, I suspect, be read for some time ahead, as testimony both of who we were in 2015 and what we believed in.</p> <p>• Simon Callow’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/346161/s/orson-welles-one-man-band/\" title=\"\"><em>Orson Welles: One-Man Band</em></a> is published by Jonathan Cape.

superfan strikes back. Star Wars shows us where the creative force lies | Catherine Shoard","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T07:00:12Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1044","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f67j","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The fact that the new Star Wars film is good – better not just than the prequels but the originals too – is of course cheering. A million pounds worth of tickets have been pre-sold in the UK; a hundred times that across the pond. Emotional investment runs to a yet bigger figure. Countless Christmases would be ruined by a turkey.</p> <p>But the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a> is worth seeing may also prove the final, shining nail in the coffin of originality. The biggest film of all time – and this will be the biggest film of all time, having scaled peak hype, and given that bricks-and-mortar cinemas are about to fall off a cliff – is to all intents and purposes a high-res copy of one made 38 years ago.</p> <p>Some young characters are introduced, but the old faithfuls are present and correct, blingy bot and beepy bin included. Likewise the spaceships, the weapons, the sliding titles, the masks, the wheezing and all those intergalactic beasties, as if someone drew a hippo while tipsy. The plot, too, is what the diplomatic might call a fond homage to the first film.</p> <p>So far, so familiar. We all know mainstream cinema is now a cannibal’s conveyor belt which seeks to refeed us yesterday’s breakfast, and to eke it out over as many portions as possible. And that movies are comfort food for the crowds, cash cows for studios and an endless jackpot for a few fat-cat creators. Where this film breaks new ground is in outsourcing the regurgitation. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is, essentially, fan fiction.</p> <p>Its director, JJ Abrams, having cut his teeth successfully rebooting Star Trek, is a highly expert, professional superfan. The man who dreamed up this universe, George Lucas, had absolutely nothing to do with the new movie. He may have received a standing ovation at Monday’s Hollywood premiere, but his genius contribution was to have no input.</p> <p>The Force Awakens would not have happened if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/30/disney-lucasfilm-star-wars-deal\">Lucas hadn’t relinquished his rights to Disney in 2012 for $4.2bn</a> (which increasingly looks like a bit of a bargain). Nor would it have been as good. Lucas made at least three Star Wars films which were vulgar and tacky, portentous and puritanical, weighed down by high personal stakes. (It’s worth remembering Lucas offered Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Robert Zemeckis the job of directing the prequels he scripted. All declined.) Abrams, being an aficionado, boasts both knowledge and, crucially, distance. Plus, a punter’s appreciation of which buttons to press.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/dec/16/the-guardian-film-show-special-star-wars-the-force-awakens-video-review\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4f5nm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2425297\"            data-video-name=\"The Guardian film show special: Star Wars: The Force Awakens – video review\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/12/16/1450270270225/KP_795717_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56715e52e4b0eb26e105b522\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/12/16/1450270270225/KP_795717_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/16/151216TGFSStarWarsSpecial_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/12/16/151216TGFSStarWarsSpecial_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/16/151216TGFSStarWarsSpecial.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/16/151216TGFSStarWarsSpecial_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/16/151216TGFSStarWarsSpecial_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/dec/16/the-guardian-film-show-special-star-wars-the-force-awakens-video-review\">The Guardian film show special: Star Wars: The Force Awakens – video review</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Disney deal looks set, then, to go down as the moment when ownership of cultural properties officially passed from creators to consumers. Those people raised on video games and talkboards are no longer prepared to tolerate the concept that fictional worlds exist only within the imagination of one person. In fact, they are indignant at being denied the keys. Like cross toddlers dodging bedtime, they will have their stories.</p> <p>On Monday,<a href=\"http://alliancetopreserve.wix.com/eualliance#!\"> The Alliance to Preserve the Expanded Universe</a> threatened Disney with “spoiler jihad” on social media if movies aren’t made of the Clone Wars fables, recently deemed officially canonical, following a protracted battle.</p> <p>“I have held my vivid tongue waiting for the movie,” wrote a campaigner called Roberto Carlos Moscono. “After it’s released, well, the gates of hell shall be released. I will see it on Wednesday at midnight, so I will have all Thursday to spoil it before anyone else sees it in the US.” Fear not. The men who call themselves freedom fighters are unlikely to prevail. Disney does not require this kind of bullying to persuade it to keep printing money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-force-awakens-a-tour-de-force-say-fans-as-galactic-franchise-stirs\">Tour de force, say fans as Star Wars franchise stirs after 10 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet this situation is the exception. Generally speaking, both studios and fans are thwarted in their attempts to gain re-entry to lands of make-believe by either the original author or the estate holder.</p> <p>If still alive, they will likely go to their grave badgered to keep mining the seam. JK Rowling might have thought she was done with Harry Potter after seven books, none of them pamphlets, but pressure was sufficiently heavy for her to agree to script a series of spin-off flicks.</p> <p>Some authors are happy to eat themselves ad nauseam: witness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/fifty-shades-of-grey-sequel-breaks-sales-records\">EL James’s male gaze reheat of Fifty Shades of Grey</a>. Origins stories are OKed everyday, from the Chronicles of Riddick to Keeping up Appearances. Last week, Lionsgate said it would respond to teenager feedback that there weren’t enough arenas in the last two Hunger Games movies by making some pre-Katniss prequels with tons of arena action.</p> <p>Sating an appetite is great. But the eagerness and means of replenishing the trough is unseemly. Even the star of the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, chose to publicly tut at her own employer’s avarice (“I think it’s too soon. They’ve got to let the body get cold”).</p> <p>When creators are actually dead, it’s easier for producers and publishers to feast on their bones – witness the endless Jane Austen spin-offs, the remorseless revivification of Frankenstein’s monster, the Ian Fleming and PG Wodehouse readalikes, the mashup of Dickens characters to be broadcast in 20 parts by the BBC over Christmas, in which Great Expectations fans can finally watch Miss Havisham cop off with Compeyson.</p> <p>Given our vulture culture, Lucas looks to have done the decent thing, for his own sake as well as those of the fans. In handing his progeny over, he has prioritised its health over his own ego. He has recognised that he cannot do as good a job at shepherding it as playmates nearer its own age. He has cut the apron strings cleanly, if belatedly.</p> <p>The model here is a man a year older than Lucas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/19/fiction.thomasharris\">Thomas Harris</a> has also devoted most of his career to the creation of a character whose backstory and mythology is every bit as intricate as that in Star Wars. Yet he freely abandoned the screen rights not just within his own lifetime, but at the first opportunity.</p> <p>He absented himself from all involvement in the Hannibal Lecter movies (some of which were excellent) and the TV show (a naff travesty). His original books are standing still, untainted by association, their author rich and blithe. And dignified.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"George Lucas let go of his Star Wars baby and it’s back bigger and better than ever, with The Force Awakens.

library closures and the fights to save them","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T00:01:03Z","fields":{"wordcount":"808","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f62x","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Hundreds of libraries have closed or been confronted with closure in the past five years as local councils across the UK deal with funding cuts. Here are some of the most notable threats to libraries – and the efforts that went into trying to save them.</p> <p><strong>Kensal Rise library, London</strong></p> <p>The library was closed down alongside five others by Brent Council in 2011to save £1m annually. Writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/30/zadie-smith-public-library-campaign\">Zadie Smith was vocal about the importance of saving the library</a>, stating: “I can see that if you went to Eton or Harrow, like so many of the present government, it is hard to see how important it is to have a local library. But then, it’s always difficult to explain to people with money what it’s like to have very little. But the low motives [of the government] as it tries to worm out of its commitment ... is a policy so shameful that they will never live it down.” Local libraries, Smith said, are “gateways to better, improved lives”.</p> <p>Following a protracted campaign, a volunteer-run library plans to open next year in a community space within the former council-run branch in Bathurst Gardens. Melvyn Bragg <a href=\"http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/melvyn_bragg_to_take_part_in_fundraising_event_for_kensal_rise_community_library_1_4281092\">gave a talk there </a>about his latest novel in October to raise funds for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/17/librarians-take-legal-fight-against-library-closures-to-government\">Librarians take legal battle against library closures to government</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Bowhill library, Fife</strong></p> <p>This month, Fife’s decision to close 16 of its libraries was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/11/ian-rankin-val-mcdermid-condemn-fife-library-cuts\">attacked by high-profile Scottish authors including Ian Rankin and Val McDermid</a>. One of the libraries due to close is Bowhill, a place that Rankin – the creator of fictional detective John Rebus – said had been his “refuge and a place of constant wonder” when he was growing up. “I’d take the maximum number of books allowed each week and remember the thrill of being told I’d reached the age where I could have an adult ticket and take books from the adult fiction section,” Rankin said.</p> <p> McDermid added: “These are libraries in small villages that don’t have other resources, and so libraries have a role that is more than just the lending of books. They serve as a community hub in so many ways – they’re a warm place to go when you can’t afford to put your heating on, and there are people who don’t have computers whose only access to the internet is in a library. To throw them away seems to me to be short-sighted.”</p> <p><strong>High Heaton library, Newcastle</strong></p> <p>Last year campaigners fighting the threatened closure of High Heaton library celebrated a new three-year lease acquired by Newcastle College, which decided to run some of its classes for students from the building. </p> <p>Two years previous, authors including Philip Pullman, Julia Donaldson, Malorie Blackman and Anne Fine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/21/newcastle-library-closure-plans-outrage-writers\">branded Newcastle council’s plans to close the vast majority of the city’s libraries as “wrong and immoral”</a>. In an open letter, they wrote: “This is no time to cut libraries. It is the young and the elderly who disproportionately depend on branch libraries. The cost in educational underachievement would far outweigh any savings made by cuts. It is not the role of a Labour council to act as a conduit for the coalition government’s ‘austerity’ cuts which disproportionately hit the poorest and most vulnerable. We call on Newcastle’s councillors to reconsider this wrong and immoral course.”</p> <p><strong>Breck Road library, Liverpool</strong><br /></p> <p>Also in 2014, residents in Liverpool expressed concern over the proposed closure of Breck Road library, claiming the people of north Liverpool would suffer as a result. Breck Road’s proposed closure was part of Liverpool council’s plans to shut down 11 libraries out of the city’s total of 18. </p> <p>Later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/11/liverpool-library-closure-plans-carol-ann-duffy-caitlin-moran\">a “love letter” to Liverpool’s libraries from a group of more than 500 writers</a>, including poet Carol Ann Duffy, Caitlin Moran, Jonathan Coe and Meg Rosoff, ensured they stayed open. “The loss would devastate Liverpool – it’s a massacre, and at the expense of the children of Liverpool most of all,” the supporters wrote. “With recent figures showing that one in three children does not own a book, it seems to us terrifying that even the chance of borrowing a book is about to be taken away from many Liverpool children.”</p> <p><strong>Sydenham Library, London</strong></p> <p>The library was among five Lewisham libraries threatened with closure in 2011 – it lost its public status that year and is currently being run by community organisations. </p> <p>At the time, there were read-ins at the library as part of a national day of protests at proposed cuts across the UK. Writer and life peer Baroness Mary Warnock said the closure of her local, which opened in 1904, would be barbarism. “In times of economic misery and unemployment, we need more not less consolation from libraries, more access to newspapers, books and computers, more places to sit, research and make friends. It is barbarism to close it,” she said.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Campaigners across the country have been fighting to keep libraries threatened by cuts open

It is urging the government to abide by the 1964 Public Libraries and Museums Act, which states that the public has a statutory right to a quality public library service, in the wake of cuts to hundreds of library services across the country.</p> <p>“We’ve had enough. We’ve marked our line in the sand here. The government is behaving as if it doesn’t have a duty of care and they do, under the law. We think it’s time to be clear about what that means,” said Nick Poole, the chief executive of Cilip, after it was announced that more than 100 library branches were shut last year, and as further branches up and down the UK face closure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/17/library-closures-campaigns-fights-cuts-uk\">UK library closures and the fights to save them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cilip, which has received legal advice from human rights barrister Eric Metcalfe of Monckton Chambers, say that while the government regularly claims that the provision of this <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2015-12-08/HL4368/\">“comprehensive and efficient” service is down to local authorities</a> to determine, this is not the case, and it is the “legal duty” of the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, “to provide clear statutory guidance on the definition of a ‘comprehensive and efficient’ service”.</p> <p>Libraries, Cilip said, are being put at risk “through a combination of neglect, short-term thinking and the failure of HM government to carry out their legal duty to the public”.</p> <p>Fife is set to shut 16 libraries, a move described as “disgraceful” by the novelist Val McDermid, while Lancashire council plans to cut its library network from 74to 34. Cilip, however, warned on Thursday that local authorities planning closures could be working against the law, and urged them to hold off making changes until discussions with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) conclude.</p> <p>Martyn Wade, chair of Cilip’s board, said that the librarian body’s investigations had “highlighted a disturbing lack of legally compliant guidance, in the absence of which many local authorities have taken discretionary decisions about their services which risk flouting the law”.</p> <p>“Under the law, the secretary of state has a duty to maintain and improve the library service,” said Poole, who will “hold the government to account for these legal duties”, including working with Whittingdale to provide “a clear and meaningful statement” of what a “comprehensive and efficient” library service entails, for local authorities to follow.</p> <p>Poole hopes to work with the government to define statutory guidance, and then to work with local authorities to deliver it. The guidelines, he believes, should define the “location and convenience” of library branches, book stock, staffing, provision of services and public programming.</p> <p>“We’re not unrealistic, but this is a matter of priority,” Poole said. “We can’t sleep walk into a situation where we lost 10, 15, 20% of our national library services … we’re not going to allow it to go any further. If it takes three months or three years, we don’t care, we are going to slow the rate of closures we have seen over the last 10 years. If we don’t act now, it will be too late.”</p> <p>Cilip urged all authorities considering changes to their library services without statutory guidance to put their plans on hold pending the outcome of its discussions with the DCMS. “Changes made to library services without reference to an appropriate statutory guideline may not be lawful, not only under the 1964 act, but also in respect of the requirements of the 2010 Equality Act,” said Poole.</p> <p>The campaign, which will also see the launch of a petition calling on the government to fulfil their statutory obligations and which has been dubbed My Library By Right by Cilip, was welcomed by Philip Jones, the editor of the Bookseller magazine.</p> <p>“The government needs to be held to account for its running down of the public library service, and this campaign nails it,” said Jones. “This is a government that has consistently turned its back as library after library has been forced to shut its doors thanks to the funding decisions made by central government, and then rolled out to local councils. Personally, I would go further than Cilip; it’s not just access to libraries that is key, it is access to books, and it is this very necessary and priceless resource that generations have been built on, that the government has placed in jeopardy.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the DCMS said: “Libraries are cornerstones of their communities and continue to be a fundamental part of society. Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service and we have powers to ensure they comply with the law. Where individual authorities have failed to meet this duty we will – and have – intervened.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Department for Culture, Media and Sport challenged over its failure to carry out legal duty of providing quality public library services","headline":"Librarians take legal battle against library closures to government","byline":"Alison Flood","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8f488d9aa4cc1afbcb0e7fe1afba7a18b33984e2/0_0_5508_3305/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>Department for Culture, Media and Sport challenged over its failure to carry out legal duty of providing quality public library services</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/17/librarians-take-legal-fight-against-library-closures-to-government","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/dec/17/librarians-take-legal-fight-against-library-closures-to-government","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"8f488d9aa4cc1afbcb0e7fe1afba7a18b33984e2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8f488d9aa4cc1afbcb0e7fe1afba7a18b33984e2/0_0_5508_3305/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

edition of actress Drew Barrymore’s memoir <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58658.Little_Girl_Lost\">Little Girl Lost</a>, co-authored with journalist <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Todd-Gold/e/B001ITYC0Q\">Todd Gold</a> and published in 1990 when she was just 15, doesn’t beat around the bush: “I had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at 10, and at 12 took up cocaine.” </p> <p>As a woman on the cusp of 40, I’m just about Barrymore’s age. I remember with some clarity huddling on the grey-carpeted floor of a mall bookstore at 14, worried but fascinated, scanning the book’s pages for ever-more-concerning details, details whose shock value was predicated on the disjoint between the public perception of Barrymore as the adorable moppet of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/et-the-extra-terrestrial\">Spielberg’s ET</a>, and the no-rules, too-much-too-soon narrative of familial dysfunction and Hollywood debauchery that was apparently taking place behind that winsome, blond-and-white-and-pink façade. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-mother-locked-up-in-institution-interview\">Drew Barrymore: ‘My mother locked me up in an institution at 13. Boo hoo! I needed it’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a mother who set few boundaries and relied on her as a breadwinner starting when she was just a baby, and an absent, out-of-his-mind father (a scion of the storied but troubled Barrymore acting clan), the odds seemed stacked against Barrymore. And like many others in America at the time, I felt more than a little invested in her wellbeing. It almost seemed as if the health of the body politic was linked in some obscure but still palpable way to the health of Barrymore herself, that golden-haired eternal child who should have been better protected so as to remain our image of perfect innocence. </p> <p>A couple of years after reading Little Girl Lost, I saw <a href=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02yh52PdJ1qzn70jo2_400.jpg\">Barrymore in an Interview magazine spread</a> where she was photographed bare-breasted and smoking. Although I was by then a teen smoker who wouldn’t have minded baring her own breasts had anyone asked, so insidious was the old Barrymore fantasy that I actually felt alarmed. Did Drew know what she was doing? Was anyone looking out for her? Would things be all right?<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc0dc5d6bf85f42c42f9fbcad4a1e807d6aee65\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ccc0dc5d6bf85f42c42f9fbcad4a1e807d6aee65/0_764_3840_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drew Barrymore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drew Barrymore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle Levitt for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the past 25 years, Barrymore has become a successful actor, movie producer, beauty-company cofounder, even the entrepreneur behind <a href=\"http://www.barrymorewines.com/\">a boutique wine label</a>, as well as a wife and mother of two young daughters. This newfound stability, however, poses a problem for her recent memoir, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-the-day-i-divorced-my-mother\">Wildflower</a>. It is missing those elements of truth in suffering that had pulled us into her younger life in Little Girl Lost. </p> <p>This feels like a missed opportunity, since Barrymore conceivably still has a pretty big story to tell in this follow-up book. Even for those who may not be as nosily fascinated as myself in the minutiae of her Hollywood love affairs over the years (<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2250146/Drew-Barrymore-Star-says-ex-boyfriend-Fabrizio-Moretti-perfect-match-Kirstin-Wiig.html\">Fabrizio Moretti</a> of the Strokes! Eric Erlandson of Hole! That random make-out session with Gossip Girl’s Ed Westwick back in 2008!), there’s so much left to examine. Chiefly, this: how did the parentless, bereft child of the late 80s become the stable, prosperous mogul of the 2010s?</p> <p>To be fair, Barrymore does note from the start that she’s not interested in writing a sweeping memoir that would give a full account of her life. In fact, “‘Memoir’ seems heavy to me, and I want this to be light,’’ she opines in the preface. “This is a book you can dip into and read when you want.” Working non-chronologically and touching on moments from her childhood as well as adulthood, Barrymore uses a recurring format: a brief recounting of a story from her past, with its end rounded out with some sort of lesson she has learned from that experience, more often than not figured in a writing relentless with exclamation marks. </p> <p>In a section about growing up essentially fatherless, for instance: “A stable, loving family is something that should absolutely, fundamentally never ever be taken for granted! I am lucky that I got dealt some cards that showed me what it’s like to not have a family, and I am much luckier to now have the chance to create my own deck! I will fight like William ‘Braveheart’ what’s-his-name to keep [my daughters] protected and intact! I am a warrior. I am a soldier. I am a not-to-be-messed-with lion! I am a mother!” </p> <p>There is more than a dollop of bootstrappy self-help in the book (about success in business: “I have an insane work ethic! I am strict with myself. I’m trained to work. I don’t know life without it. ... You have to kill yourself. Do your homework. Exhaust yourself.”) We also get some bland stories of Barrymore’s friendships and relationships (skydiving with Cameron Diaz; shenanigans on a road trip with her best friend and producing partner Nancy Juvonen; a pancake-making session gone wrong with her fiancé, now-husband), none of which are particularly revealing. There are some nice, loving missives Barrymore addresses to her young daughters, but it’s not totally clear why these should be shared in a book rather than simply given to them.</p> <p>I’m happy for Barrymore, I really am. She’s clearly made it to the other side of a horrible childhood, which couldn’t have been easy, and there’s something appealing about her palpable desire to do better, to not repeat the patterns that made her young life so miserable and risky. But writing, too, means taking risks and having something to lose, and in this pat book, almost hysterical in its need to project a safe sunniness, Barrymore tells us precious little about who she really is or about how she got from there to here. </p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Her first memoir, Little Girl Lost, had a cult status in the 1980s, but this

Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle","headline":"UK freezes export of unique Erasmus manuscript by William Tyndale","byline":"Maev Kennedy","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Robert McCrum: </strong>Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict","headline":"The 100 best novels: No 68 – Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry (1947)","byline":"Robert McCrum","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Richard Coles:</strong> the crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert to the gap between what was said and what was done","headline":"PD James remembered by Richard Coles","byline":"Richard Coles","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

to read over Thanksgiving","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-26T13:00:05Z","fields":{"wordcount":"830","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more

for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

by Lindsay Hunter review: teenagers on the road to nowhere","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-13T19:48:59Z","fields":{"wordcount":"710","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"This debut novel exposes truths about class,

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"This west African thriller

Flanagan wins Man Booker prize with ‘timeless depiction of war’","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-15T06:50:27Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1025","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42eba","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Australian novelist picks up award
