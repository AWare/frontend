The walls of Nakumatt collapsed. There are a lot of bodies inside.\"</p><p>Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based, al-Qaida-linked group behind the attack, claimed the government had carried out a \"demolition\" of the building, burying 137 hostages.</p><p>The Kenyan government rejected claims that any militants remained alive, or that they had demolished part of the building, but said the mall's upper–level car park had collapsed, bringing the second level down on to the ground floor on top of at least eight civilians and one or more attackers.</p><p>Government spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the number of dead – which stood at 67 – already included the bodies of those buried beneath the rubble, and denied the figure would rise further.</p><p>Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku, said the process of determining the number of dead and gathering evidence from the mall could take a further week. He said the US, Israel, Britain, Germany, Canada and Interpol were helping with the investigation.</p><p>\"This morning, forensic experts began sifting through the rubble at the Westgate mall,\" Lenku said at a press conference close to the centre.</p><p>\"This process involves finger-printing, DNA and ballistics examination. We do not expect the numbers of the dead to increase in any significant way. Yes, there could still be bodies trapped in the rubble. We can only confirm that after we have gone through the rubble.\"</p><p>The US ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec, said US experts were providing technical support and equipment to Kenyan security forces and paramedics.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418286901'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/25/1380132142438/Westgate-shopping-mall-sh-010.jpg' alt='Westgate shopping mall shooting in Kenya' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sikhs come together in Nairobi, Kenya, to cremate a grandmother and son who were killed in the Westgate mall attack.

The British government said that a number had also been injured and were still in Kenya receiving treatment, but declined to provide any further information. A spokesman also said he could not rule out the possibility that one or two British nationals, or dual nationals, were still missing.</p><p>As questions remained about whether any of the attackers was from the UK, the British high commissioner in Kenya, Christian Turner, confirmed that a Briton had been arrested but said: \"We do not believe that the individual was of central interest to this operation.\"</p><p>The statement came after intense speculation as to the role of foreign al-Shabaab recruits in carrying out the attack, following reports that a British woman and two or three Americans may have been involved. Neither country has ruled out the claims, but the US attorney general, Eric Holder, said there had been no verification that Americans were involved.</p><p>\"Most of the jihadis are diaspora Somalis who have been living in the west,\" said a Kenyan intelligence source, who did not want to be named. \"We know this was an operation by a faction of al-Shabaab, with Somalis, probably working with al-Qaida.\"</p><p>More details were beginning to emerge about the attack itself. One military expert told the Guardian he had information that al-Shabaab had set up inside the mall, where they had stockpiled weapons and ammunition in preparation for the siege.</p><p>\"This is a terrorist cell that has been operating in Kenya for a while,\" said Colonel Benjamin Muema, security expert in Nairobi. \"It is a cell that knows the mall, had a blueprint of the building, and was a step ahead of the security forces.</p><p>\"I believe that this group has had premises within the mall, and that explains how they were able to continue for four days without running out of bombs, grenades and explosive devices.\"</p><p>The government did not rule out that a female attacker was involved. \"Regarding the identity of the terrorists, we want to request the public and the international community to allow our experts to undertake the forensics,\" said Lenku.</p><p>Al-Shabaab also made claims about the way the attack was carried out, stating in an email exchange with Associated Press that foreigners were a \"legitimate target\" and that Muslims had been spared.</p><p>Late on Wednesday night, al Shabaab's leader for the first time confirmed claims by his group's members that it was behind the attack on the mall, Reuters reported.</p><p>In an audio posted on the <a href=\"http://www.somalimemo.net\">al-Shabaab-linked website,</a> Ahmed Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu al-Zubayr, said the attack was in retaliation for Kenya's incursion in October 2011 into southern Somalia to crush the insurgents.</p><p>\"Take your troops out or prepare for a long-lasting war, blood, destruction and evacuation,\" Godane said in the message delivered in the Somali language and apparently directed at the Kenyan government. Kenyan troops are fighting alongside African peacekeepers against the militants in Somalia.</p><p>Al Shabaab had threatened revenge since Kenyan troops joined the conflict.</p><p>\"You are part of the massacre Kenya carried out in Kismayu and in other towns because you had elected your politicians. The tax you pay is used to arm Uhuru [Kenyatta] forces that massacre Muslims. You had supported the fight against us,\" Godane said.</p><p>As conflicting claims continued surrounding the details of the attack, coroners dressed head-to-toe in protective clothing were busy clearing inside the city's main morgue – a single storey building surrounded by neat hedges and leafy gardens that did little to mask the strong odour of decaying corpses.</p><p>\"We are preparing to receive up to 160 bodies here\", said Marion Githinnaji, member of the Nairobi city assembly in charge of the Nairobi city council mortuary. \"This morgue acts as a clearing house. People come here to identify the bodies, and we do the fingerprints and processes, then the bodies and police files are moved to private facilities because there is not enough space.\"</p><p>\"We have coroners there at the mall but because the military are handling it, we haven't been able to remove any of the bodies yet. They haven't told us exactly how many to expect.\"</p><p>An elderly lady, clutching a bottle of water and wearing a lime green jacket and matching headband, who did not want to be named, had identified a body as her nephew. She spoke through tears as she criticised the authorities for their handling of her nephew's case.</p><p>\"We came here yesterday to identify the body, and we came again at 8am today for the postmortem,\" she said. \"The police say that the doctor refuses to do the postmortem, and the doctor says it's the police. What is this?\"</p><p>There is mounting criticism of the Kenyan authorities' handling of the victims and of the attack itself.</p><p>Muema said it represented a serious failure of intelligence. \"There was no intelligence, nobody knew that this attack was going to happen, and everyone was caught by surprise.</p><p>\"Then the initial response was to deal with it as a robbery, not as a terrorist attack, which only served to aggravate the situation.</p><p>\"And then when the magnitude of the attack was revealed, the agencies were not unified under a single command structure. No one knew who anyone else was and there may well have been friendly fire.\"</p>","headline":"Kenya mall attack: dozens more bodies believed buried under rubble","trailText":"<p>Intelligence source tells Guardian that one attacker remains engaged in conflict with security forces</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/25/1380132135130/Westgate-shopping-mall-sh-005.jpg","wordcount":"1234","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"418268579","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8118962","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Afua Hirsch in Nairobi","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-26T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1971153","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-28T18:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/kenya-mall-attack-bodies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/25/kenya-mall-attack-bodies","tags":[{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"profile/afuahirsch","webTitle":"Afua Hirsch","r2ContributorId":"28094","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/8/1289231487480/afua-hirsch.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Afua Hirsch is social affairs and education editor at Sky News and a former Guardian correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/afuahirsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418286900","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/25/1380132135130/Westgate-shopping-mall-sh-005.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Kabir Dhanji","altText":"Westgate shopping mall shooting in Kenya","height":"84","credit":"Kabir Dhanji/EPA","caption":"Sikhs come together in Nairobi, Kenya, to cremate a grandmother and son who were killed in the Westgate mall attack.

Military personnel had been advised against visiting the Kenyan capital's high-profile shopping malls, in case they were targeted by terrorists. He went anyway but took his handgun as a precaution. Like many in the country's poorly paid armed services he had hopes of a job at the nearby UN headquarters and was meeting a friend in the diplomatic police to look over his CV. Their discussion was abruptly interrupted by rapid bursts of automatic fire only a few metres away.</p><p>Musungu looked down and saw four men striding towards the entrance to the mall, firing at the cars around them as they went. Before he could stand up the first grenade detonated. About 150 metres away at the vehicle entrance a second group of attackers had driven their car through one of the barriers, scattering the unarmed security guards. They jumped out of the vehicle and began firing and throwing grenades at passers-by.</p><p>As Musungu and the policeman took cover, a bullet ripped through a woman dressed in black jeans and a T-shirt standing next to them. She had tried to run away and been shot through the back.</p><p>The woman in black was one of the first victims of a co-ordinated slaughter that had been planned for months; a small band of jihadi fighters, perhaps as few as eight, killed at least 67 people in what became an 80-hour siege. Building on detailed interviews with survivors, their relatives and members of the security forces, as well as insights from officials involved in the operation, it is now possible to give the most complete account so far of what happened at Westgate.</p><p>The picture that emerges is of a woefully disorganised response from authorities, where infighting and a clash of egos left a handful of Kenyan officers, an off-duty British soldier and an Israeli security agent, backed by Kenyan-Indian vigilantes, to fight heavily armed militants in a bid to rescue hundreds of shoppers. A friendly-fire killing in the early hours of the siege led to the withdrawal of security services, allowing the attackers to regroup, rearm from a weapons cache inside the mall, and hunt down desperate people hiding inside.</p><p>Five minutes after the assault began in the rooftop car park at the rear of Westgate, radio DJ Sadia Ahmed was getting ready to judge a children's cooking competition.</p><p>When she heard the first blast she thought it was a gas cylinder. Two more blasts followed and people started to run from the food court through the second floor entrance/exit.</p><p>They ran straight into the firing line of two militants who came up the vehicle ramp into the parking area. As Ahmed ran for cover, her fellow judge and radio presenter Ruhila Adatia-Sood, left, was shot dead. She was six months pregnant.</p><p>Karani Nyamu, a software engineer who was shopping with his two daughters, emerged into the gunmen's line of fire, but miraculously survived. As he ran towards his car he saw two men throwing grenades \"like maize to chickens\" and shooting indiscriminately. After 20 minutes, with bodies everywhere, they went inside the mall.</p><p><strong>12.40pm</strong> Meanwhile, in a section of the basement car park underneath the mall, the attackers set up what an intelligence source described as a \"command and control centre\" in an unidentified vehicle. The vehicle is thought to have been driven to the car park some time in advance of the attack.</p><p>One or more of the militants is believed to have been in mobile phone contact with the others from here, while intelligence intercepts suggest that some of the Twitter statements that al-Shabaab started to release later in the day originated from here. The death of Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, who was shot in his car as he was preparing to leave, confirms the presence of armed gunmen in the basement from the beginning of the assault.</p><p><strong>12.50pm</strong> Joshua Hakim, an accounts clerk, had stopped at the mall on his way to a rugby match. He left his three American friends at the second-floor Java coffee shop and headed to the giant Nakumatt supermarket that took up a third of Westgate's floor space to buy some beer. He was on the interior balcony of the first floor when he heard shots from below. As he took cover on the floor under a table, repeating the mantra \"Jesus is lord\", he heard shots from above as well. Then two armed men appeared on his level. After firing several rounds they called out in English: \"Muslims, get out of here!\"</p><p>Summoning his courage, Hakim approached one of the men, who was wielding an assault rifle in each hand. Hakim believes they were M-16s. Hakim showed the man his voter card, holding a thumb over his Christian name. The gunman, who was wearing a black bandana embellished with Arabic script, shouted at him to leave. An older man, of Indian origin, approached and was asked to name the mother of the prophet. When he hesitated, he was shot. Hakim dived to the floor again and lay there watching a woman remove her niqab. She tore it into strips and, in one of many small instances of bravery during the siege, handed it to the women around her to wear as Islamic-style headscarves.</p><p><strong>1pm</strong> Musungu had run out through the vehicle exit from the basement on the far side of Westgate from the attackers. He found armed guards from a bank's private security firm, who had abandoned an armoured car used for money collections, cowering in a corner. He shouted at them: \"Why don't you return fire?\"</p><p><strong>1.10pm</strong> Officers from Nairobi police's flying squad arrived at the scene but initially refused to enter, according to news reports. Meanwhile, armed volunteers from a neighbourhood watch scheme run by Kenyan-Indians in the nearby district of Parklands arrived.</p><p>Together with at least two uniformed police, Musungu and his colleague, they numbered roughly 30 and split into two groups. One team was detailed to take the ground floor, the other, led by Kenya Red Cross secretary-general Abbas Gullet, climbed the ramp to the roof-top parking. Other armed \"samaritans\" including Somali-Kenyan Abdul Hajji, the son of a former defence minister, Mohamed Yusuf Hajji, who had been texting his brother who was trapped inside, reached the scene soon afterwards.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419139831'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380269574358/A-child-runs-towards-Abdu-009.jpg' alt='A child runs towards Abdul Yusuf Haji amid a shooting spree at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A child runs towards Abdul Yusuf Hajji. Photograph: Goran Tomasevic/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><strong>1.15pm</strong> The ground floor team said they saw at least two gunmen who were \"walking not running\", picking their targets. Terrified shoppers ran into the cavernous supermarket pursued by the attackers who exchanged fire with Musungu's irregular band. His friend from the diplomatic police was hit in the thigh and Musungu helped him outside. Several people were injured and Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic, who had entered the mall after the attacks began, helped to get them outside.</p><p>In some places the gunmen stopped to separate Muslims from non-Muslims. In one case, shocked by the audacity of four-year-old British boy Elliot Prior, who scolded a gunman for shooting and injuring his mother, the militant showed mercy and spared his life. In others cases, such as at the Urban Gourmet Burger restaurant – where Australian-Briton Ross Langdon and his Dutch partner Elif Yavuz died – people were slaughtered en masse.</p><p>On the roof, a British man with close-cropped hair and a background in the SAS ushered the survivors through a side entrance to the third floor Java Coffee shop, from where a fire escape led to the ground floor and safety.</p><p>At the same time, a shaven-headed man who two witnesses said was Israeli had reached Hakim and others on the second floor. The man asked Hakim if he knew how to use a weapon and offered him a handgun. \"I'd never fired a gun, so I had to say no,\" he said. Along with at least a dozen others, the clerk was led up one floor and out through the fire escape.</p><p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Almost an hour after the assault had begun, authorities were still trying to work out what was going on. A spokesman for the Kenyan military, Major E K Chirchir, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajorEChirchir/statuses/381363590458277888\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \"Anyone on twitter who is at Westgate and in position to update?\"</p><p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Witnesses on the car park roof saw at least two men, who they believe to have been attackers, changing into casual clothes near the tent where the cooking competition was judged. At this point there was no police cordon and no screening process for survivors coming out of the mall. Intelligence officials believe that at least two attackers were able to escape in the confusion.</p><p><strong>4pm</strong> Three-and-a-half hours after the first shots were fired, Kenya's equivalent of a Swat team, the police reconnaissance unit known as the \"recce group\", arrived at the mall. Wearing black body armour and helmets, armed with machine guns and trained for hostage and siege situations, they were the best-equipped to deal with the attackers, and were able to pin them down inside Nakumatt.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419139832'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/27/1380313469071/A-police-officer-secures--009.jpg' alt='A police officer secures an area as civilians flee inside Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A police officer tries to secure an area while civilians flee in search of safety. Photograph: Siegfried Modola/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>The first army units also arrived, including infantry from the Embakasi base outside Nairobi and US-trained Kenyan rangers from their base in the Rift Valley. Behind the scenes a power struggle was emerging between the police chief David Kimaiyo and the army head, Julius Karangi, over whose forces would take the lead. First to move in was the recce group, followed shortly afterwards by Kenyan army (KDF) soldiers.</p><p><strong>5.30pm</strong> Now with substantial numbers of military or paramilitary personnel on site, the authorities had not yet established a clear command and control structure. With no radio communications between army and police units, KDF soldiers opened fire on what they thought was an armed suspect – but who was in fact one of the commanders of the recce group. After this all units were pulled out of the mall and for the next two hours the operation came to a standstill as heated arguments raged that went all the way to the State House and the office of Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya's president.</p><p>\"There was a lot of politics going on,\" said one soldier close to the makeshift command centre. As night fell and no nightvision equipment was available, it was decided that the police chief, Kimaiyo, would be in overall charge of the operation.</p><h2>Sunday 22 September</h2><p><strong>7am</strong> Under the command of the police chief, a joint unit comprised of police and army made a first attempt to enter and take control of the ground floor of Nakumatt, where they believed the bulk of the militants were. They came under fire from a sniper on one of the upper floors and were forced to withdraw after at least two of their men were shot, one of them fatally. \"They have an arsenal in there,\" <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kenya-shopping-mall-attack-latest-military-takes-control-of-shopping-centre-and-says-all-hostages-freed-8831413.htm\" title=\"\">said one of the soldiers</a> involved in the operation.</p><p><strong>9am</strong> It was a Sunday morning in Nairobi, and by now hundreds of onlookers had gathered on the high ground overlooking the Westgate mall. The police also had to deal with a growing media presence as news crews set up live points in the roadside furniture market looking down Peponi Road towards the shopping centre. Regular bursts of gunfire punctuated the morning, with one official saying that the operations were aimed at depleting the militants' ammunition store.</p><p><strong>2pm</strong> The Kenyan police and interior ministry announced 59 people had died and 175 more were injured. Officials estimated the number of attackers to be as many as 15, but no fewer than 10.</p><p><strong>3pm</strong> Relatives of the missing people gathered at the Oshwal Centre – a community centre and Hindu temple about 200 metres from Westgate. Volunteers brought food and medical supplies, and people camped overnight in the basement car park. Johnson Mungai, a young pilot whose two sisters and grandfather were still inside, said he had given his phone to police so that they could contact his relatives.</p><p>They received a text message in the morning from his grandfather who was hiding in the Planet Yogurt shop, that read: \"How far have you got?\" He doesn't know if there was any further communication because the police ran down his battery and no one had a charger. The 23-year-old became increasingly angry with the authorities' handling of the crisis. \"The government is letting the people down. The Kenyan police is saying they don't need help and should be allowed to do their work. What work have they done?\"</p><p><strong>4.50pm</strong> \"White\" military men, working in teams of three, were seen to enter the building carrying specialist rifles. They were later identified as Israeli commandos. Kenya's recce group re-entered the mall, with some officers carrying rocket propelled grenade launchers. Over the next two hours two loud explosions were heard from within the mall.</p><p><strong>11.28pm</strong> The KDF Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kdfinfo/statuses/381877655227731968\" title=\"\">announced that the siege was nearly over</a>. The last of Joshua Hakim's three American friends inside the mall – who asked not to be named – emerged. He had been hiding in the cold storage room of one of the restaurants on the second floor food court.</p><h2>Monday 23 September</h2><p><strong>6.45am</strong> The KDF's assurances that the siege was reaching a conclusion were shattered by a huge blast that shook the entire Westlands district, followed by bursts of gunfire. Overnight, Kimaiyo had been forced to cede control of the operation to Julius Karangi, who had argued for a more aggressive approach throughout the crisis. By now a command centre had been set up in the Ukay shopping centre opposite the vehicle entrance to Westgate. A British team was present in the room, including officers from the Metropolitan police's anti-terror unit along with Israeli officials.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419139833'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/24/1380011134181/Smoke-rises-from-the-West-014.jpg' alt='Smoke rises from the Westgate mall in Nairobi' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Smoke rises from the Westgate mall in Nairobi Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Four more large blasts – the loudest during the siege – were heard from inside Westgate and a column of black smoke climbed into the sky. The fire was still smouldering a week later. Helicopters that had been hovering just over the roof the previous day began to circle higher overhead.</p><p><strong>7.40pm</strong> Inside the situation room at the State House, about two miles from the scene at Westgate, there was despair as a series of triumphalist and bizarre messages poured onto Twitter from senior officials – including one from Kimaiyo, which has since been deleted, and read: \"Taken control of all the floors. We're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish them. IG\"</p><p>A generation gap between the president's mainly US-educated, younger staffers and the senior staff in the army and police emerged. \"We had our heads in our hands when we saw the Kimaiyo tweet,\" said a Kenyatta staffer. \"What was he thinking?\"</p><h2>Tuesday 24 September</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419139834'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380294401132/Ruins-of-Westgate-mall-Na-008.jpg' alt='Ruins of Westgate mall, Nairobi 26/9/13' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The ruins of the Westgate mall. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p><strong>12.30pm</strong> The first shaky amateur footage of the rear of the shopping centre emerged, showing a vast crater in the rear third of the building. The rooftop car park area where much of the worst of the carnage took place had collapsed into the floors below. Officials first claimed that the militants had set off explosives and set fire to mattresses inside Nakumatt supermarket.</p><p>That explanation was changed to say that a wire-guided anti-tank shell, an RPG-7, had been fired at one of the support pillars in an attempt to distract a sniper during an operation to rescue survivors from the mall. After the attack several Kenyan army soldiers corroborated this version of events. But a munitions expert cast doubt on it, saying that a weapon of this kind, capable of dislodging the central pillar of the building, would have seriously injured anyone standing up to 20 metres behind it, as well as wounding the person discharging it in a confined space.</p><p>Moreover, a private security contractor familiar with the operation said that directional explosives used in demolition jobs had likely been deployed to blast a square hole in the roof: \"They decided that they were taking too many casualties and would drop the roof on them. There is no way that was an anti-tank munition,\" he said.</p><p><strong>8pm</strong> Explosions and gunfire continued inside Westgate all day and was said to be coming from troops providing cover while bomb disposal teams removed booby traps. A soldier inside the mall described the difficulty of the operation inside. \"Every panel of glass is broken, there is debris everywhere. We found people alive and we found people dead. We don't know what's under the debris. We don't know what's behind closed doors.\"</p><p><strong>10pm</strong> President Kenyatta declared \"the operation is now over\" in a live televised address. \"The agents of terror, themselves craven wretches and lowly cowards, had the agenda of perpetrating grievous mayhem in our country, senselessly killing, maiming and traumatising harmless, innocent people,\" he said.</p><p>\"The criminals found us unafraid, as we ever shall be. We cannot be conquered. Our confrontation with the terrorists at Westgate mall left 240 casualties.\" He concluded that 61 civilians died in the attack and that six security officers had died. A fuller account of what had happened and what had become of the reported hostages – said by Kenyan officials the previous day to number 30 – was expected to follow.</p><h2>Wednesday 25 September</h2><p>Shopkeepers and store owners returned to find their properties looted. A clothes-shop owner said even his mannequins had been stripped: \"They've broken everything. All my money is lost over there. All the cash is lost. Everything is shattered over there, laptops gone, everything.\"</p><p>A day later, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAF0En4Z0VI\" title=\"\">footage emerged of the inside of Artcaffe</a> showing scores of empty beer and spirit bottles littering the tables and lining the bar, where only Kenyan security forces had any access during the siege.</p><p>The owners of the second floor Millionaire's Casino – who had emptied the safe while the siege was still officially underway – returned four days later to discover that while the premises were under government control someone had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY4M7Yw7Bh0\" title=\"\">attempted to shoot their way into the safe</a>.</p><p>Kenya's <a href=\"http://gadocartoons.com\" title=\"\">celebrated satirical cartoonist Gado</a> captured the mood when he portrayed Kenyan soldiers – who had been feted for their bravery days before – running away from the ruined shopping centre carrying looted goods and drinking beers. After days of conflicting reports there was no longer any confidence in the authorities when they announced that the figure of 60 people missing had fallen suddenly to 39.</p><p>Two weeks later it remains unclear whether the militants ever held hostages in the conventional sense. Survivors who emerged from Westgate had been hiding from the attackers, not being held. There have been unconfirmed reports that some were tortured or mutilated during the siege, but doctors said it remains possible that the physical injuries could have been sustained by grenade fragments.</p><p>Despite the number of people missing, only three bodies have officially been recovered from the rubble of the mall. Two of those belonged to Kenyan soldiers whose remains were so badly mutilated that families had to give DNA samples to identify them.</p><p>The Kenyan government continues to insist that five attackers were killed by its security forces, but has admitted that none of their bodies has been conclusively identified so far. Forensics teams, including agents from the FBI, have found remains they believe may have belonged to at least one of the attackers, but the person has not been named.</p><p>On 1 October, facing mounting criticism of his administration's handling of the Westgate attack, Kenyatta promised an official inquiry.</p>","headline":"Terror in Nairobi: the full story behind al-Shabaab's mall attack","trailText":"<p>A detailed investigation, based on interviews with survivors, relatives and security forces reveals how infighting and incompetence left attackers free to prolong slaughter</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya-terror\" title=\"\">View enhanced desktop version</a></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380889194871/Nairobi-shopping-mall-att-003.jpg","wordcount":"3167","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"419067436","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8154586","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Daniel Howden in Nairobi","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-10-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1975773","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-07T12:09:22Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya","tags":[{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"profile/daniel-howden","webTitle":"Daniel Howden","r2ContributorId":"58960","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380886619351/DanielHowden.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Howden reports for the Guardian from Nairobi.

That may have been more a perception than a realistic analysis of its reach. Despite its losses, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/kenya-westgate-shabaab-somali-conflict\" title=\"\">factional infighting</a>, the militant Islamist group still holds vast swathes of territory. So although Mogadishu has been enjoying something of a renaissance, it is still in a war zone. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22965842\" title=\"\">UN Development Programme</a> <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/27/us-somalia-conflict-idUSBRE96Q0A420130727\" title=\"\">and the Turkish mission in Somalia</a> have both been targeted this year. Now that a complex, large-scale, Mumbai-style terrorist attack has been staged in the heart of the Kenyan capital, it may be time to revise some of the more premature assessments that the al-Qaida-linked group was on the wane.</p><p>Al-Shabaab was quick to claim responsibility for the assault on the Westgate shopping mall, and the assumption is that this was the long-feared reprisal for Kenya's unilateral decision two years ago to intervene in Somalia, wipe out the militant group and create a buffer zone. But another more worrying possibility is that this attack could also have involved Kenyans radicalised by the Salafi jihadi creed.</p><p>Kenyan forces went into Somalia, not so much to stabilise the war-torn country, but to get al-Shabaab. The fear was that the Somalia's instability would spill over its borders and go down the coast threatening Mombasa, East Africa's most important port and Kenya's vital tourist industry. Somali pirates had already begun to prey on coastal towns in Kenya and two foreign aid workers were snatched from a refugee camp near the border. The Kenyan intervention was accompanied by a crackdown on radical Islamist preachers and clerics in the coastal areas. The assassination of Sheikh Aboud Rogo, who was facing terror-related charges, was widely condemned as an extrajudicial killing and sparked clashes between police and Muslim youths. While a heavily armed group could have come across the border to mount an attack of this sophistication, the other possibility is that an operation like this could have been supported by cells within Kenya. There may be those who will be tempted to stage revenge attacks on Kenya's large Somali population. An entire suburb of Eastleigh is known as the Somali district. The Kenyan government has a duty to provide security for Somalis, especially when emotions are running high. However, the real concern raised by this attack is that Islamic radicalisation in Kenya <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/africa/horn-of-africa/kenya.aspx\" title=\"\">may go deeper</a> than the Mumbai- style model may suggest.</p><p>Al-Shabab's threat to strike Kenya is no longer bravado. It is real. It has become the deadliest militant movement operating in the Horn of Africa. To stop it growing further, Kenya needs to draw on all its resources and learn the lessons of others. Counter-terrorism must not generate and feed its own insurgency.</p>","headline":"Kenya mall attack: war on the home front","trailText":"<strong>Editorial: </strong>It may be time to revise some of the more premature assessments that al-Shabaab was on the wane","newspaperPageNumber":"34","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3j26g","wordcount":"452","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"418080421","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8107338","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1969936","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-26T22:14:17Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-mall-attack-editorial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-mall-attack-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/editorials","webTitle":"Editorials","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/editorials","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/editorials","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

It wasn't possible to get close to the mall the following day, the police dropped a tear gas canister on journalists. I was trying to think of how to get back into the mall but I din't believe I could get in without being arrested as I was carrying my 500mm lens. You have to feel the atmosphere, know when a good time is, if you miss your opportunity, you cannot go ahead, you have to feel it and react quickly.</p><p>The attack was a complex situation, my experience in conflict zones helps to recognise where potential threats are and what is going on. I've seen a lot of different situations of people dying but I always say it's my job to cover these stories and if I can help someone, I will. I always believe people should see how it is and sometimes it's terrible but they should know the reality.</p><p>• <em>This is an edited version of a blogpost which first appeared on the Reuters <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/\">Photographers Blog</a></em></p>","headline":"Kenya attack: a photographer's view from the Westgate mall","trailText":"<p>Goran Tomasevic of Reuters recounts his experiences covering the first few hours of the attack by Islamist militants on the Westgate shopping mall</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380108975483/Women-carrying-children-r-004.jpg","wordcount":"634","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"418236321","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","internalPageCode":"1970803","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-02T12:20:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography-blog/2013/sep/25/kenya-attack-photographers-westgate-mall","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/photography-blog/2013/sep/25/kenya-attack-photographers-westgate-mall","tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/photography-blog","webTitle":"Photography blog","description":"The latest news reviews and debates from the world of photography, from the Guardian’s picture desk\r\n","type":"blog","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography-blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/photography-blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/photography","webTitle":"Photography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/photography","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418239294","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380108986228/Women-carrying-children-r-009.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Goran Tomasevic","altText":"Women carrying children run for safety during the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya","height":"276","credit":"Goran Tomasevic/Reuters","caption":"Women carrying children run for safety during the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

British prime ministers are famously eager to escape royal audiences in Balmoral. But Cameron's flight shows indecent haste. He apparently needs to solve the Kenyan hostage crisis. Really? The Queen was doing Kenya crises before he was born.</p><p>Sometimes we should stop and ask why terrorists commit outrages like that in a Nairobi shopping mall. The answer is the west always over-reacts to big, sensational gestures of extreme violence. Had the Somalian al-Shabaab sect merely shot up a street in Mogadishu, would Cameron have rushed to Cobra? As it is, Cameron has helped send them to the top of the terrorist charts.</p><p>There is nothing anyone can do to prevent suicide bombers hitting civilian populations. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/suicide-attack-pakistani-church-peshawar\" title=\"\">slaughter of Christians in Peshawar</a> this weekend showed that wherever crowds gather they are vulnerable to any group with a brainwashed youth and a bomb. It might be sensible to discourage like-minded crowds from gathering in one place, be they co-religionists or party faithful or merely the wealthy.</p><p>The modern urban obsession with celebrity buildings and high-profile events offers too many publicity-rich targets. A World Trade Centre, a Mumbai hotel, a Boston marathon, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/21/nairobi-mall-attackers-target\" title=\"\">Nairobi shopping mall</a> are all enticing to extremists. Defending them is near impossible. Better at least not to create them. A shopping mall not only wipes out shopping streets, it makes a perfect terrorist fortress, near impossible to assault.</p><p>There is no defence against the terror weapons of guns and grenades. Nor in any society, free or repressive, is there defence against fanaticism unto death in pursuit of a cause, however madcap and hopeless. Every city needs competent police and alert intelligence – that is not diverted into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/19/gchq-we-monster-we-cant-control\" title=\"\">reckless surveillance of all</a> and sundry.</p><p>The best defence is a sense of proportion. The \"war on terror\" has failed on its own terms. It had made dozens of countries not pacified but terrified. By deploying violence against a succession of Muslim states, the world's leading powers have made their business its business and invited retaliation. They have not crushed al-Qaida any more than they have suppressed extreme Islamism. They have refreshed rather than diminished that extremism, and made the world less safe as a result.</p>","headline":"Kenya mall attack: David Cameron's rush to 'solve the crisis' won't help","trailText":"<strong>Simon Jenkins: First thoughts:</strong> Cameron has helped send al-Shabaab to the top of the terrorist charts by summoning Cobra.

But maybe it can break our inhumane habit of distancing ourselves from trouble 'over there'","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T05:01:08Z","body":"<p><br />By now, we're told, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-siege-authorities-try-to-secure-control-live\">standoff at Westgate Mall</a> in Nairobi, Kenya, is over. The country has entered an official period of mourning – though, at this writing, there's an air of caution about whether it's safe to enter.</p><p>The official toll is chilling. Among the dead: 61 civilians and six law enforcement officers, as well as five of the militants who had stormed the mall and turned it into a hostage zone that later became a battlefield. Nearly 250 casualties in all. Various reports have added anywhere from eight (the official government estimate) to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kenyan-officials-soldiers-killed-20354498\">137 more dead</a>, according to the hostage-takers.</p><p>It's an attack that has been difficult to look away from, and it has dominated news coverage of the past few days. Over that time, it must be said, terrorist activity in other parts of the world has also claimed many lives. There was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/pakistan-church-bombings-christian-minority\">bombing on Sunday</a> at an Anglican Church in Peshawar, Pakistan, that killed 85 people. And a rash of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/world/middleeast/bomber-hits-sunni-funeral-as-attacks-mount-in-iraq.html\">attacks at funerals in Iraq</a>, killing dozens in a country where more than 5,000 people have died this year in similar acts of violence.</p><p>These events are an all-too-common occurrence in many places. And that is not to mention natural disasters, like the devastating<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57604518/pakistan-earthquake-kills-more-than-200-creates-new-island-off-southwest-coast/\"> earthquake that hit Pakistan</a> Tuesday, killing at least 300 people, with the death toll rising. But the mall siege in Nairobi in particular captured our collective attention. Did you notice that?</p><p>Is it because we recognize the target – a shopping mall – as a place we, too, have gone with friends and family, and tried on clothes, and eaten fast food? A kind of \"western\" environment, and as much a symbol of freedom as the football stadium, or the office building? Maybe.</p><p>In essence, though, none of these attacks on innocent people really differ. That is to say … do they? How do we make sense of such horror? Is it easier to separate ourselves? And do we really need to draw distinctions between a bombing at a funeral in Iraq, and an attack on a mall in Kenya?</p><p>We have in the past. It's easier that way. We're not very honest when it comes to addressing deaths happening across the globe. Or maybe, we're scared; or in denial. You see, the violence we're talking about does have one thing in common: we like to think it happened \"over there\".</p><p>And it happens \"over there\" a lot. That interpretation is a problem. It's reductive and it's untrue. Increasingly, \"over there\" is a construct, a state of mind.</p><p>In a globalized world, where we enjoy the benefits of favourable trade relationships, where we draw the fuel to power our economies, where we can travel almost instantly and communicate with very little interruption around the globe, \"over there\" no longer legitimately applies. To be specific: these events in Kenya or Pakistan or <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-russia-dagestan-judge-idUSBRE98O0YV20130925\">Russia</a> are happening here, in <em>our</em> world. We're part of it.</p><p>We cannot be selective about our desire to globalize. We cannot attach, say, economically, but detach when events aren't savoury or to our liking.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a solution to problems like extremism, and terrorist acts, and states with unstable or non-existent governments. But maybe, just maybe, we can begin by changing our minds about \"here\" and \"over there\".</p><p>We need to engender a sense of connection, not just in our commercial interests, but in our human community, too.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/q/about/\">Q with Jian Ghomeshi is broadcast daily on weekdays on CBC Radio 1, in selected US cities via PRI, and on SiriusXM</a></p>","headline":"The Kenya mall attack brings home the deeper meaning of globalisation","trailText":"<p><strong>Jian Ghomeshi:</strong> Nairobi's horror has transfixed us.

<p>With other analysts, Kilcullen predicted that there would be further attacks in east African countries, including Uganda, which had sent troops to fight al-Shabaab in Somalia as part of an African

His friend, Josh Weinstein has cross-posted this tribute to the LSE's blog, which is extracted below:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I found out yesterday that a friend was killed in the senseless, horrible attack in Nairobi. He was a great person and meant a lot to many people. He had a profound impact on so many people&rsquo;s lives that I would not even begin to understand how to chronicle it all....</p> <p>I met Ravi early on in my time in Nairobi. I remember thinking that this guy was exceptionally smart. Subsequently, I found out he had bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, a masters degree in financial economics from Oxford, and another masters in econometrics and mathematical economics from the London School of Economics.</p> <p>After teaching statistics to graduate students at the London Business School for a year &ndash; at the tender age of 26 &ndash; he decided to move to Kenya to commit himself to the cause of poverty alleviation.</p> <p>When I heard the news, I was crushed. I was with my friend Sharon, who lived with Ravi for a few months in Nairobi. For two days, we felt helpless, having to watch from afar....</p> <p>I find it deeply ironic that Ravi would end up having his life taken by the people he most wanted to help.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ramrattan was from Trinidad and Tobago. his local paper has covered <a href=\"http://guardian.co.tt/news/2013-09-23/village-mourns-humble-hero\">his death here</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pleasant, humble and brilliant, Ravindra Ramrattan was a hero in his hometown of Munroe Road, Cunupia.&nbsp;</p> <p>When he won the President&rsquo;s Medal, Gold, in 2002, while a student at Presentation College, Chaguanas, the community celebrated with his family.</p> <p>When he migrated to study at renowned Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and later, the London School of Economics, the success story of this humble young man filled his neighbours&rsquo; hearts with pride...</p> <p>Grieving mom Parbatie Ramrattan held on to a relative and cried, as the tragedy, thousands of miles away in Kenya, was reported on CNC3 and photos of the Trinidadian scholar flashed on the television screen.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;I never expected to be doing my son&rsquo;s funeral. I have two sons, (Ravi and Rajiv) to do our rites when we die, not us to do their rites,&rdquo; the devout Hindu woman cried.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Ravi left me too early. He should not have died now because he had so much to live for. He was an innocent victim in that situation.\"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Local television news has also interviewed his parents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-m6C35Zf1Q\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9-m6C35Zf1Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-24T14:51:43.714+01:00\">at 2.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5241865ae4b09e440159ad34\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-24T13:34:13.385+01:00\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StefSimanowitz/statuses/382474925937684480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;Your spirit shines forever &amp; you will always be loved&quot; Msg for Elif &amp; Ross &amp; their unborn baby, Kenya Embassy, Ldn <a href=\"http://t.co/gGqCr5t46K\">pic.twitter.com/gGqCr5t46K</a></p>&mdash; Stefan Simanowitz (@StefSimanowitz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StefSimanowitz/statuses/382474925937684480\">September 24, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52418597e4b073439ec092d3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-24T13:32:25.853+01:00\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SAS hero</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's an extract from the Daily Mail yesterday <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2430201/British-hero-mall-massacre-Ex-Royal-Marine-handgun-saved-100-lives-terrorists-ran-amok.html#ixzz2foRgg74v%20\">who report the heroic actions of an off-duty soldier</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A former marine emerged as a hero of the Nairobi siege yesterday after he was credited with saving up to 100 lives.</p> <p>The ex soldier was having coffee at the Westgate mall when it was attacked by Islamists on Saturday.</p> <p>With a gun tucked into his waistband, he was pictured helping two women from the complex.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e32bf301-32bf-49e3-8611-d6745c64d467\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/24/1380025909784/5ee79e6c-aacf-4a57-8637-97e71490b0ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"NAIROBI, KENYA - SEPTEMBER 21: An off duty SAS soldier with his handgun saves two women trapped inside Westgate Mall on September 21, 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>NAIROBI, KENYA - SEPTEMBER 21: An off duty SAS soldier with his handgun saves two women trapped inside Westgate Mall on September 21, 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya.

Since 2007, at least 50 people have gone from Britain to Somalia as foreign fighters. For the United States, the number is likely to be higher. Nationals of both countries have become suicide bombers on behalf of al Shabaab.</p> <p>The majority of foreign fighters continue to be ethnic Somalis, attracted by a mixture of national sentiment and global jihadist ideology. Still, there is a significant number of non-ethnic Somalis and even Muslim converts who have adopted al Shabaab&rsquo;s cause. The most prominent among them is Alabama-born <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/jihadist-rapper-omar-hammami-killed\">Omar Hammami</a> &ndash; aka Abu Mansoor al Amriki &ndash; who was among the FBI&rsquo;s Ten Most Wanted.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4a64d19d-9296-43ae-b527-70c3827c78ae\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/24/1380015757025/9414b0dc-5fda-441b-9ac4-4561d74875c4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Omar Hammami addresses al-Shabaab fighters in a farm within Afgoye district near Somalia's capital Mogadishu May 11, 2011.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Omar Hammami addresses al-Shabaab fighters in a farm within Afgoye district near Somalia's capital Mogadishu May 11, 2011.

Especially since 2012, Somalia and other destinations have been overtaken by Syria, with nearly 1,000 Europeans estimated to have gone in the past two years.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>Over the last few years, Al Shabaab has systematically reached out to Westerners. The group has run a sophisticated media campaign targeting English speakers, with well produced video clips presenting Somalia as the forefront in the global struggle against the &ldquo;Crusaders&rdquo;.</blockquote> <blockquote>Only two weeks ago, al Shabaab released a slick &ldquo;documentary&rdquo;, highlighting the stories of several Americans who are fighting with the group. &ldquo;This is the real Disneyland&rdquo;, claimed one of them, imploring fellow American Muslims to join him.</blockquote> <blockquote>Once in Somalia, the foreign fighters&rsquo; roles and responsibility vary. Many find it hard to blend into traditional Somali society, and their fighting abilities are limited. Instead, al Shabaab often uses their technological skills to help the group improve its propaganda output. If it turns out to be true that Westerners were involved in the Westgate attack, this would, therefore, be a significant departure.</blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-524151fee4b078484b5fd334\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-24T09:52:43.550+01:00\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hostages still in building say militants</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is the latest report from AP news wire:</p> <blockquote> <p>The militant group that attacked a Nairobi mall and killed at least 60 people says it is still holding hostages alive inside and that its fighters are \"still holding their ground.\"</p> <p>The Twitter messages posted Tuesday by the al-Qaida-linked rebel group al-Shabab came after Kenyan government assurances of success in the fourth-day of the standoff.</p> <p>Al-Shabab says the hostages \"are still alive, looking quite disconcerted but, nevertheless, alive.\"</p> <p>A security expert with contacts inside said Monday night there were at least 30 hostages when the assault began Saturday and at least 10 were believed to be still inside the upscale mall.

The relative, who spoke to the programme on condition of anonymity, said the 23-year-old had made infrequent but increasingly erratic phone calls to the family. The most recent had been in the summer when he said he was in trouble and wanted to return home.</p> <p>On being shown the CCTV footage, the relative told Newsnight: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I feel or think &hellip; If it is him, he must have been brainwashed.&rdquo;</p> <p>The programme said a former neighbour of the family in Larvik said the man had been &ldquo;pretty extreme, didn&rsquo;t like life in Norway &hellip; got into trouble, fights, his father was worried&rdquo;. He said one person seen in the CCTV footage wearing a black shirt or jacket could be the man he had known.</p> <p>Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up for al-Shabaab.</p> <p>&ldquo;The biggest problem is the so-called Generation 1.5, those who weren&rsquo;t born in Norway but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;[Al-Shabaab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries.&rdquo;</p> <p>Last week Norway&rsquo;s intelligence agency, the PST, said it was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/world/africa/norway-kenya-mall-siege.html\">attempting to verify reports</a> that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which lasted four days.</p> <p>&ldquo;We have lately seen an increase in the number of persons leaving Norway to take part in acts of war, attend training camps or join terrorist networks abroad,&rdquo; the Norwegian authorities said. &ldquo;We are concerned that this development may have an increasingly negative impact on the threat situation in Norway.&rdquo;</p> <p>A Kenyan al-Shabaab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, reportedly may have spent time in Norway, according to the Norwegian station TV2. It said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/us-navy-raid-somalia-target\">Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir</a>, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before receiving a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims.</p>","headline":"Westgate mall suspect identified by BBC as Norwegian national","trailText":"Relative says 23-year-old left Larvik for Somalia in

remain unaccounted for almost a week after the end of the four-day terrorist attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall which killed at least 67, the Kenyan Red Cross has said.</p><p>The Red Cross's report of 39 missing people conflicts with the government's contention that there are no remaining missing people from the attack that began on 21 September, and suggests that the death toll could still rise as investigators dig through the rubble of the partially collapsed mall.</p><p>\"The numbers with us are what we are still showing as open cases that are reported to us,\" said Abbas Gullet, head of the Kenyan Red Cross. \"The only way to verify this is when the government declares the Westgate mall 100% cleared – then we can resolve it.\"</p><p>At least 61 civilians and six security troops were killed in the attack. Government reports on the number of terrorists killed have been confusing and at times contradictory.</p><p>The president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said last week that five attackers had been killed by security forces' gunfire, and his office said one or more might be trapped under the building's rubble.</p><p>In an interview on Citizen TV late on Sunday night, however, the interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku, said two attackers had been hit by gunfire and that the building was thought to have collapsed on three others.</p><p>Later in the interview he said all five Islamist attackers were thought to be under the rubble, and that no bodies of any terrorist suspects had been recovered. \"We are sure they never got out of the building, so let the forensic examination establish the exact truth,\" he said.</p><p>When pressed about the government's initial estimate that 10 to 15 terrorists could have been involved in the attack, Lenku conceded that the figure could have been wrong, or that some could have escaped.</p><p>\"We do not rule out the possibility that when we were evacuating people in the first stages of the operation it is possible some could have slipped out,\" he said. \"And that is why we are holding a number of people for interrogation; that is why we immediately sealed off the points of exit, the airports.\"</p><p>Gullet said the Red Cross number of missing had been dropping over the past week as bodies had been positively identified and as some missing people had been reunited with their families. On Friday the Red Cross said the number of missing people stood at 59.</p><p>The Nairobi city morgue said it had no remaining bodies recovered from the Westgate attack as of Friday.</p><p>On Sunday Lenku said police had no missing persons reports from the mall attack, and that authorities did not believe there had been any hostages in the mall building when it partially collapsed.</p><p>He left open the possibility, however, that things might change. \"We think – unless the forensic investigation shows otherwise – we really do think that there were weren't any hostages,\" he said.</p><p>In the television interview later on Sunday, Lenku indicated it was possible that people were reporting the missing to the Red Cross and not to the police. \"Why is this not being reported to the police?\" he asked. \"Kenyans must learn to use the government machinery to do their report.\"</p><p>Investigators from Britain, the US, Canada and Germany are participating in the investigation into the attack and are aiding Kenyan forensic experts poring through the mall complex. Results are not expected until later this week at the earliest.</p><p>Kenyan authorities have detained a total of 12 people in connection with the attack, including one on Sunday. Three people have been set free, including a British man who was reported to have been arrested last week as he tried to board a flight from Nairobi to Turkey with a bruised face, Britain's Foreign Office said.</p><p>The militant group al-Shabaab has said it carried out the mall attack to punish Kenya for sending its troops into neighbouring Somalia to fight the al-Qaida-linked militant group, which had seized large parts of that country for years before being dislodged from the capital, Mogadishu.</p>","headline":"Kenyan mall attack: 39 still missing, says Red Cross","trailText":"Minister says it is possible people are reporting the missing to the Red Cross and not to the police","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/30/1380550384554/Westgate-mall-victims-lis-003.jpg","wordcount":"668","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"418652358","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8136598","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press in Nairobi","internalPageCode":"1973221","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-03T14:20:17Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/kenyan-mall-attack-missing-red-cross","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/30/kenyan-mall-attack-missing-red-cross","tags":[{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418652642","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/30/1380550382489/Westgate-mall-victims-lis-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Simon Maina","altText":"Westgate mall victims list","height":"54","credit":"Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Men look at a list of victims of the Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi.

According to counter-terrorism documents, the government and military were warned that al-Shabaab was planning an attack on the capital where it would storm a building and hold hostages.</p><p>There are also reports that Kenyan intelligence agents were at Westgate a few hours before the crowded shopping centre was struck by heavily armed terrorists last Saturday, in a four-day siege that left at least 67 people  dead.</p><p>\"We cannot say that this attack comes as a surprise,\" said Farah Maalim, former deputy speaker of the Kenyan National Assembly. \"The possibility of something like this happening, and of failures in the Kenyan intelligence community, has worried us for years.\" Maalim added: \"We have an intelligence service more worried about internal party politics than about threats to national security.\"</p><p>It was announced yesterday that a sixth Briton has died following the siege. The Foreign Office has said it cannot rule out the possibility of further casualties.</p><p>Kenya refuses to comment on reports of warnings prior to the attack, but officials say they are still investigating the relationship between the attackers and al-Shabaab's local offshoot, al-Hijra. In the past, Kenya's large Somali-Kenyan population has borne the brunt of suspicion for involvement in terrorism, but sources say that the authorities are now focusing investigations on ethnic Kenyan converts to Islam for suspected links in the Westgate attack. One young convert was arrested and allegedly tortured last week, say human rights groups, for his suspected role in al-Hijra and Westgate. Allegations of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings by the Kenyan authorities have gone hand in hand with their continuing investigations into al-Shabaab and al-Hijra networks in Kenya.</p><p>Terrorist activity in cells in cities such as Nairobi and Mombasa has led to a spate of arrests – including the warrant for the arrest of British woman Samantha Lewthwaite – and what are believed to be assassinations after senior figures such as Aboud Rogo Mohammed, a former leader of al-Hijra, have been killed in unexplained circumstances.</p><p>Experts say that, as al-Shabaab has been weakened in Somalia, it has focused more and more on Kenya and its al-Hijra cell. In a report earlier this year, the United Nations group of experts that monitors the activities of al-Shabaab points to the appointment of a new leader for the group in Kenya last year, Sheikh Ahmad Iman Ali, as the impetus for a wave of grenade attacks and improvised explosive device explosions in Kenya, which have killed scores in recent months.</p><p>The report also warns that al-Hijra was planning large-scale attacks such as the one on the Westgate mall. \"Al-Shabaab no longer recruits young Somali men to carry out dirty work for them,\" said Abdiwahab Sheikh Abdisamad, a Somali-Kenyan Horn of Africa specialist at Kenyatta University in Nairobi. \"Now they have got members from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, even Comoros – these are the ones carrying out attacks.\"</p><p>The diverse nature of al-Shabaab recruits is backed up by the group's own online propaganda. One photo, published on a pro-al-Shabaab website this year, shows light-skinned and at least one apparently white recruit in desert military uniform during a parade. The site claims that the images were taken at Barawe, a port in south-eastern Somalia where the Kenyan-born suspected al-Qaida operative Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan was killed in a US military raid in 2009.</p><p>\"Al-Shabaab is getting global support. It does not belong to Somalis any more. They have a strong network, and they are going from China to Chile, from Khartoum to Canada,\" said Abdisamad. \"They want to Islamise the whole world, they have a global agenda and are getting advice and recruits from everywhere.\"</p><p>Yet despite widespread knowledge of the activities of al-Hijra, little has ostensibly been done to disrupt the group. \"There are reasons why you don't just smash these networks up,\" said an international intelligence source. \"You have to be very surgical in the way that you take it apart, with targeted prosecutions or assassinations.\"</p><p>Some have speculated that Kenya lacks any serious intent to disrupt al-Shabaab. \"If we wanted to eliminate al-Shabaab in Somalia, we could do it in less than three months. But it seems we decided we didn't want to eliminate them completely because then we would have no legitimacy for being in Somalia,\" said Maalim. \"Somalia is a cash cow for all the countries in the region,\" Maalim added. \"It's a free-for-all. And in Kenya the terrorist attack seems a source of celebration for some – now we can challenge the international criminal court, we receive equipment and arms from the US and other allies, we can get the aid money flowing.\"</p><p>Kenya's counter-terrorism and intelligence strategy will come under increasing scrutiny as details continue to emerge from the rubble of the Westgate shopping centre, where an unknown number of bodies still lie buried after a large part of the structure collapsed. Seventy-one people are still missing, and no bodies have yet been recovered.</p><p>\"Five suspected terrorists were killed during the operation and the ongoing forensic investigations will ascertain their identities,\" said the Kenyan government. \"These investigations will answer the questions being raised about their nationalities and gender.\"</p>","headline":"Kenyan authorities had been warned about threat to buildings 'day before attacks'","trailText":"<p>Intelligence agents are said to have been in Westgate mall just hours before killings, as criticism over government grows</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"29","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/28/1380389284351/Family-members-at-the-fun-005.jpg","wordcount":"857","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"418536349","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8131440","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Afua Hirsch in Nairobi","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-29T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1972700","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-01T18:52:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/28/kenya-authorities-warned-of-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/28/kenya-authorities-warned-of-attack","tags":[{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/afuahirsch","webTitle":"Afua Hirsch","r2ContributorId":"28094","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/8/1289231487480/afua-hirsch.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Afua Hirsch is social affairs and education editor at Sky News and a former Guardian correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/afuahirsch","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/worldnews","webTitle":"World news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/worldnews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/worldnews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"publication/guardianweekly","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly","type":"publication","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/guardianweekly","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418618415","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/28/1380389280301/Family-members-at-the-fun-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Aijaz Rahi","altText":"Family members at the funeral of Sudharshan Nagaraj","height":"54","credit":"Aijaz Rahi/AP","caption":"Family members at the funeral of Sudharshan Nagaraj, one of the Westgate victims.

I had just crossed the frontline from Somalia's southern port city of Kismayo, which was taken from al-Shabaab a year ago and is still held by the 17,000-strong multinational African Union force.</p><p>\"Look! Over there!\" a corporal from the west African state of Sierra Leone, one of the smaller contributors to the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), shouted. He pointed through the window slit of our armoured car at some fast-moving, distant figures. \"They are afraid when professionals come.\" He was right, as far as this encounter went. Al-Shabaab avoids most direct confrontations with conventional armies.</p><p>Amisom's main role is to confront the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab movement. The Somali government, although internationally recognised, is weak; its army is mostly a mixture of militias still loyal to quarrelling warlords. Africa's leaders did not want another Afghanistan on their doorstep, so they moved in with Amisom – led by Uganda – seven years ago with a mandate and financial support from the United Nations.</p><p>The  al-Shabaab militia, brought to world attention by its actions in Nairobi, is more than a radical Islamist group committing acts of terror. It is also by far the most powerful local army in Somalia. It controls more than half the country. \"If Amisom left today,\" said a Somali journalist who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, \"al-Shabaab would take power in the capital Mogadishu tomorrow.\"</p><p>A clue to understanding al-Shabaab, and why it has such influence, is in its name. It means \"The Youth\" in Arabic. Somalia is a nation of some 8 million and one of the poorest in the world. The vast majority of people here are under the age of 20. The Somali people have a proud history of nomadism, but drought and food shortages have forced millions off the land they once shared with their prized camels and endless skies. Somalia is now a part of the modern world, where jobs and income matter – and jihadists are recruiting. Mostly unemployed, poor and disenchanted by corrupt governments, Somali youths are relatively easy to manipulate. A story is told in the excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/04/most-dangerous-place-fergusson-review\" title=\"\">study of Somalia</a> by James Fergusson – <em>The World's Most Dangerous Place</em> (Bantam Press) – of a group of schoolboys who were tempted into joining al-Shabaab by being given a piece of fruit every day.</p><p>The social and economic crisis in Somalia is exacerbated – and to some extent caused – by clan warfare. It was hardly surprising that a radical Islamist movement saw this cauldron of problems as a happy hunting ground for recruits. Al-Shabaab is undoubtedly strong. It is capable of press-ganging local recruits and attracting foreign jihadists. But I have seen no evidence that it is genuinely popular. The al-Shabaab-held village of Goobweyn was not a good place for me to make a judgment on this. Arriving in a cloud of dust in an armoured car, and wearing a bright blue \"Press\" flakjacket and helmet is not the best way to find honest interviewees – in Somalia or anywhere else. The only man who would talk to me seemed nonchalant about our arrival and continued sitting by a roadside shack from the moment the soldiers and I arrived to when we left in another cloud of dust.</p><p>When I asked this grey-haired Somali about the al-Shabaab presence in Goobweyn he shrugged as if to dismiss the question. \"Al-Shabaab are everywhere,\" he said through a translator. \"They are here; they are in Mogadishu. And look what happened in Nairobi – they are there, too.\" An ambiguous response. It could have meant he condemned this widespread presence – or he could have been boasting about it. Maybe he was an innocent elder; maybe he was an al-Shabaab supporter.</p><p>More telling, perhaps, were the words of a farmer I met in Kismayo who had fled to the regional capital from his home of Jillib to the north, in the heart of al-Shabaab-held Somalia. This man, Musa Ali, once had 15 acres on which he grew mangoes, beans and maize. He also had a seven-room house, he told me – very prosperous by Somali standards. But Ali was now living in a camp for displaced people in Kismayo on an abandoned municipal rubbish tip. His only room now was a six-feet-square enclosure of rusting corrugated iron sheets with the carcasses of two armchairs.</p><p>\"Al-Shabaab took half my crops as taxes,\" he said, \"and would not let my girls go to school. It was so oppressive. I could not breathe. So I prefer this place\" – his arm swept in the filthy vista of the rubbish tip – \"to my farm.\"</p><p>When the commander of the southern Somalia sector of Amisom, Kenyan brigadier Antony Ngere, showed me his map of \"al-Shabaab infested areas\" it included a large number of red blobs where Amisom rarely ventures. \"This is a difficult war to win,\" the bespectacled brigadier said. \"It is slow. But that is no reason not to fight this war. We shall continue to fight it, and we shall win.\"</p><p>Al-Shabaab's status as a military force to be reckoned with became clear to me on our short journey across the frontline from Amisom-held Kismayo to the al-Shabaab-held village of Goobweyn – beyond which are larger al-Shabaab-controlled towns such as Jillib and Buale. On the side of the rough tarmac road I saw lines of sandy foxholes and trenches stretching into the distance. The trenches were littered with the detritus of war – bullet casings, scraps of uniform and empty food tins. \"These are the al-Shabaab positions,\" said Lieutenant Joseph Adekule of the Sierra Leone army. \"They come here at night to fire on our defences around Kismayo.\"</p><p>They certainly do. I spent eight nights in Kismayo – staying either at Kenyan positions or with the Sierra Leonean forces. Every night I heard heavy gunfire – from automatic rifles to big anti-aircraft-style machine guns, mortars and artillery. At both the Kenyan and Sierra Leonean bases I slept only 200 yards from the Amisom frontlines. I didn't get a lot of sleep.</p><p>Most of the firing appeared to be from Amisom troops after short bursts of \"incoming\" fire from al-Shabaab. Amisom officers sought to minimise the harassing of their positions by telling me these were mere \"probing attacks\". But the \"probing\" of the Amisom lines by al-Shabaab was in reality very similar to the muscular Sierra Leonean patrol I accompanied into al-Shabaab-controlled Goobweyn. The main difference is that the Sierra Leoneans and I were able to ride into the al-Shabaab village in an armoured personnel carrier. But the tall young Sierra Leonean Lieutenant Adekule who led that patrol was also \"probing\" his enemy's lines. If one of the sides were overwhelmingly stronger, they would overrun the other's positions. But they are not.</p><p>Amisom has made headway in recent years – taking Mogadishu from al-Shabaab in 2011 and Kismayo in 2012. But the number of red blobs on Brigadier Ngere's map is still large and does not seem to be shrinking. He said that with better equipment Amisom could move forward. When the UN-backed African intervention was first planned it was envisaged it would have 12 helicopters – the kind that can fire heavy weapons from the sky as well as ferry troops to the battlefields. To date, it has been supplied with none.</p><p>Some Kenyan and western politicians have described the mass killings in the Westgate shopping mall as \"an act of desperation\" by a marginal movement that is \"on the run\". But it has always been a fatal error to underestimate Somali uprisings or revolts. Remember <em>Black Hawk Down</em>? In the early 1990s, thousands of American troops withdrew from Somalia in disarray after a badly planned anti-famine intervention went sour. The marines had misunderstood the \"skinnies\", as they dismissively described Somali militiamen.</p><p>Amisom has already lost at least a hundred times more soldiers in its campaign in Somalia than the 18 dead US marines who made Hollywood history. Some estimates say Uganda alone has lost 3,000 men. And Somalia's wars, conducted in shopping malls or in the frontlines around Kismayo, appear to be far from over.</p><p><em>Mark Doyle is the BBC's international development correspondent</em></p>","headline":"On the shifting frontlines of the fight against al-Shabaab","trailText":"<p>Even as last weekend's horrific events in Nairobi were unfolding, a brutal and deadly war was being played out hundreds of miles to the north in Somalia</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"34","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380320462103/Kenyan-soldiers-in-Somali-005.jpg","wordcount":"1380","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"418510112","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8130150","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Doyle","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-29T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1972582","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-01T08:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/somalia-fight-against-al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/29/somalia-fight-against-al-shabaab","tags":[{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"world/somalia","webTitle":"Somalia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/somalia","references":[]},{"id":"world/africanunion","webTitle":"African Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africanunion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africanunion","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/focus","webTitle":"In focus","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/focus","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/focus","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418557033","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380320458367/Kenyan-soldiers-in-Somali-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Ben Curtis","altText":"Kenyan soldiers in Somalia","height":"54","credit":"Ben Curtis/AP","caption":"Kenyan army soldiers stand in a dugout position at their base in Tabda, inside Somalia.

When the hangover clears, and the generation that fought in Afghanistan and Iraq comes home from these wars, we'll find that much of what we thought we understood has changed. The future (crowded, coastal, urban, connected) will be so different from Afghanistan (remote, landlocked, rural) that we'll have to reconsider much of what we think we know about 21st-century conflict.</p><p>Attacks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/nairobi-mall-siege-police-teargas\" title=\"\">like this week's siege in Nairobi </a>reinforce what we've already seen in places like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mumbai-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">Mumbai</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/11/pakistani-elections-bomb-blast-karachi\" title=\"\">Karachi</a>: that urban environments, including complex pieces of urban terrain like shopping centres, hotels and industrial facilities, are the battlegrounds of the future. And the urban siege, with its commando-style tactics and guerrilla infiltration of a big city's ebb and flow, is increasingly the tactic of choice for a wide range of adversaries.</p><p>Western countries will almost certainly still do counterinsurgency operations in the future. But these will happen in a different environment: wars in remote, mountainous, landlocked places such as Afghanistan are getting rarer by comparison to urban littoral conflicts, simply because wars happen where people live, and in the future people will be overwhelmingly concentrated in coastal cities.</p><p>To understand this, we need to treat cities (not nation states) as the primary unit of analysis. We need to bring that analysis down to the city and sub-city level, understanding communities and cities as systems in their own right. We need to understand how a city's subsystems and subdistricts fit together, as well as how that city nests within regional and transnational flows. Taking the time to observe a city for long enough to see the rhythms of its metabolism turns out to be critical in understanding it. In Kenya, it seems al-Shabaab conducted meticulous, intensive surveillance on the Westgate Mall while planning their attack. Similarly, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) spent more than a year scoping Mumbai before the 2008 attacks, studying the city and its flow.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418495882'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380305514426/Mumbai-Taj-Mahal-hotel-008.jpg' alt='Mumbai Taj Mahal hotel' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai, which was attacked in 2008.

The vast majority of these were civilians randomly caught up in the attacks, especially in the railway terminus, where the greatest carnage took place among commuters trapped in a tight space, unable to escape. Property damage from the raid was estimated at over $18m (£11m) – not counting the broader cost to the Indian economy.</p><p>The raiders consciously exploited the urbanised, connected, coastal environment of Mumbai and Karachi, from which they sailed. Mumbai, a megacity of just over 20 million, is India's second-largest city, and is one of the most densely populated urban centres on the planet, with almost 33,000 people per square kilometre. The attackers skillfully exploited the complexity of this urban environment, landing from the sea in coastal slums only a few hundred yards from the high-rise luxury hotels and office blocks that were their targets.</p><p>Once ashore, the raiders exploited the connected, networked nature of the urban environment. They used Skype, cellphones, and satellite phones to connect with their handlers in Pakistan, who in turn monitored Twitter, news blogs, international and local satellite news and cable television in real time, which allowed them to control the attacks and react as the Indian response developed. The Mumbai attack was thus, in effect, directed by remote control.</p><p>As in Nairobi, the attack team's focus on foreigners seems to have been calculated to maximise international attention, creating an extremely high level of news coverage – and resulting in an unusually large number of foreigners (including citizens of 22 countries) being killed. The attacks didn't involve weapons of mass destruction or hi-tech equipment. The raiders used small arms (rifles and pistols), improvised explosive devices, and grenades; they didn't even use rocket-propelled grenades. Small arms, however – because they involve intimate contact between attackers and victims, because their use implies the presence of an enemy on the spot, and because gun battles last longer than bombings – can have a greater terror effect than a bombing or hostage situation, something we have just witnessed in Nairobi. Like the Nairobi attackers, the Mumbai raiders used no unusually sophisticated or specialised communications devices: they employed commercially available phones and off-the-shelf GPS devices, and pulled much of their reconnaissance data from open-source, online tools such as Google Earth.</p><p>What does all this say about the future environment? Mumbai and Nairobi represent only one kind of threat that will exist in the urban, networked littoral of the future. Crime researchers John P Sullivan and Adam Elkus describe this as an evolved 21st-century form of \"urban siege\".</p><p>\"There are several methods that terrorists and criminal insurgents use to besiege cities from within – pure terror and systems disruption, although the two are often combined together. Both methods are sustained means of besieging a city with a campaign of protracted urban violence. Pure terror is a form of social systems disruption. It is a spasm of violence intended to demonstrate to the public that the authorities cannot help them, and that they are helpless against the power of the gun.</p><p>\"While the success of the Mumbai terrorists came in large part from the tactical and operational inadequacy of Indian law enforcement response, it is easy to imagine a small group of terrorists creating multiple centres of disorder at the same time within a major American city in same manner. An equally terrifying scenario is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,5860,1296676,00.html\" title=\"\">Beslan-type siege</a> in school centres with multiple active shooters. Paramilitary terrorists of this kind would aim for maximum violence, target hardening, and area denial – capabilities that many SWAT units would be hard-pressed to counter.\"</p><p>To my mind, Mumbai represents the current state-of-the-art in urban littoral terrorism, while Nairobi (which lies inland) represents the application of urban siege tactics beyond coastlines. The Mumbai attack showed that a non-state armed group can carry out an appallingly effective seaborne raid on a major coastal city, over a three-day period, in several dispersed locations – the type of operation traditionally associated with high-tier special operations forces such as the US Navy SEALs or the Royal Marines' Special Boat Service. Indeed, Mumbai was a further demonstration of a long-standing trend, sometimes called the democratisation of technology, in which non-state armed groups are fielding highly lethal capabilities that were once the preserve of nation-states.</p><p>Understanding the new, highly connected nature of urban environments like Mumbai or Nairobi is an important first step in preparing to deal with this problem. Big data can sometimes help. Analysts can now track millions upon millions of data points (traffic patterns, say, or cellphone usage, or pedestrian movement, or prices in markets, or internet hits, or bank transactions, or numbers and types of cars in parking lots) to understand, through remote observation, how a city works. But how do we do that in enormous megaslums that are constantly growing and morphing and which don't have the street names and building addresses that allow geo-data to mean something?</p><p>Many of today's coastal cities, especially those in the developing world, are growing at breakneck speed. In a conflict, people's uncertainty arises from&nbsp;armed groups targeting the population; in a city that's growing exponentially – constantly outgrowing itself – the same terrifying lack of predictability can arise simply from the pace of change. Thus a megacity under stress can offer opportunities for conflict entrepreneurs (gang leaders, crime bosses or militant extremists) to control populations, provided they create a predictable rule set that makes people feel safe in the face of instability. This occurs because of the predictability inherent in the rules, whether people like the group or not, and regardless of the content of those rules. You don't have to like the cops, or agree with the speed limit, for the road rules to make you feel safe. Eventually, provided the group builds consistency and order, through a spectrum of persuasive, administrative and coercive measures, it&nbsp;may gain the loyalty and support of the local population.</p><p>This is exactly what has happened in large parts of Nairobi, where gangs like Mungiki have come to dominate the city's informal settlements – slums that account for more than 60% of Nairobi's population, crowded into only 6% of its land area. Kenya's national crime research centre recently identified 46 gangs operating across the country, many at least as violent as al-Shabaab.</p><p>Groups like al-Shabaab and al-Qaida will be with us for the foreseeable future, and attacks like Nairobi and Mumbai will remain part of the picture. But what the bigger pattern of global change – three billion new urban-dwellers in the developing world's coastal cities by mid-century – shows is that the challenge of urban overstretch may dwarf the threat of terrorism as we've known it since 9/11. As we dust ourselves off after a decade of war, community resilience, public safety and economic opportunity in crowded urban areas may turn out to matter more than counterterrorism or counterinsurgency. Designers and urbanists speak of participative development and human-centred design as key elements of a new approach to city development. Figuring how to co-design solutions in partnership with a local community, when the community is under threat and someone is shooting at you, may be the hardest challenge of all.</p><p></p><p><em>This is an edited extract from David Kilcullen's book Out of the Mountains: The Coming Age of the Urban Guerrilla, publiushed by Hurst and </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849043243\" title=\"\"><em>available from the Guardian bookshop for £20</em></a><em>.

Three others have been released after questioning, said the interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku.</p><p>\"Police are holding eight suspects as they seek to unmask the faces behind the terror attack,\" he said. All eight are being held under counter-terrorism legislation, which allows detention for long periods without charge.</p><p>The government also said that an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/interpol-arrest-warrant-samantha-lewthwaite-white-widow\" title=\"\">international arrest warrant issued on Thursday</a> for the Briton Samantha Lewthwaite, while not linked directly to the Westgate attack, was part of the ongoing security operation. \"In view of the security situation, the level of Interpol alertness has been raised in respect to known global terrorists including the British woman Samantha Lewthwaite,\" a statement said.</p><p>Ole Lenku said investigators trying to identify the attackers were searching through the rubble of the mall where three floors collapsed after a series of blasts and a huge blaze. He said they were making good progress.</p><p>Investigators have recovered a vehicle believed to have been used by the terrorists who led the attack, a top government official told the AP. They are also building the profile of a man who warned a pregnant woman at the mall to flee for her own safety moments before last Saturday's attack, he said. Another intelligence official said the attackers rented a small store in the mall up to a year before the attack. The claim chimes with reports that the levels of weapons and ammunitions involved in the attack suggested long-term planning.</p><p>The collapse of a third of the mall has made it inaccessible to international forensics experts combing through the building. The official said it was expected that bodies would be found after excavation of the collapsed roof began.</p><p>However, Manoah Esipisu, a government spokesman said: \"There are some reports that 160 more bodies will be uncovered – this is just another misleading fact being bandied around by people who don't have information. Until we have forensic information we cannot say anything conclusively.\"</p><p>Lawyers representing one of the detained men are in the process of filing a writ of habeas corpus to secure his release. Ali Gitonga was arrested and then taken to the Armed Forces memorial hospital in Nairobi, where he received treatment, said Al Amin Kimathi, executive director of the Muslim Human Rights Forum. Gitonga, a driver, said he was dropping his employer's daughter at Westgate when the attack started.</p><p>\"We believe that Gitonga is innocent – the state have not provided any information that suggests there is a good reason why he was arrested,\" said Kimathi. \"We believe this is a case of profiling – Gitonga is a Kikuyu who converted to Islam. [The authorities] believe it is the later converts who have been recruited. That is the strongest point they have against him.\"</p><p>Two relatives of Gitonga were arrested on Sunday when they visited him in hospital, before being released on Thursday, Kimathi said. \"We are getting worrying reports of youths like these being detained for a long period after having been arrested simply for visiting someone in hospital,\" he added. \"It is a long time for the police to determine their innocence, and they never appeared in court.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 3 October 2013. The earlier version said that Ali Gitonga was dropping his employer at Westgate when the attack started, that he was arrested at the Armed Forces memorial hospital, and that lawyers representing him had filed a writ of habeas corpus.</p>","headline":"Kenya siege: eight held in connection with attack on shopping centre","trailText":"<p>Kenyan police hold suspects under counter-terrorism legislation, which allows detention for long periods without charge</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"23","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380306993904/Samantha-Lewthwaite-003.jpg","wordcount":"584","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"418496498","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8128966","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Afua Hirsch in Nairobi","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-28T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1972524","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-30T18:34:27Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/kenya-siege-westgate-mall-police-hold-suspects","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/27/kenya-siege-westgate-mall-police-hold-suspects","tags":[{"id":"world/westgate-mall-attacks","webTitle":"Westgate mall attacks","description":"The latest news and comment on the Westgate mall attacks in Nairobi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/afuahirsch","webTitle":"Afua Hirsch","r2ContributorId":"28094","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/8/1289231487480/afua-hirsch.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Afua Hirsch is social affairs and education editor at Sky News and a former Guardian correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/afuahirsch","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418982784","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/27/1380306991778/Samantha-Lewthwaite-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"REX/Mark St George/Faceboook","altText":"Samantha Lewthwaite","height":"54","credit":"REX/Mark St George/Faceboook","caption":"Samantha Lewthwaite in a family photo with her husband, Germaine Lindsay, the 7/7 bomber.

Lewthwaite's involvement in the Westgate mall siege in Kenya may not be complete fiction, but either way the real story is about much more than her","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T05:40:44Z","body":"<p>This is a true story. Somewhere in Bujumbura, the capital of the small African nation of Burundi, a&nbsp;colonel is building his house. He has laid the foundations, put up a staircase and the exterior walls, now he is fixing a roof. The economy in Burundi, like much of the African continent, is growing, and the price of land is on the rise. But people like our colonel, employed by the public sector, don't always share in the spoils. In his case, the reward for years of distinguished service in the country's military is only a few hundred dollars a month.</p><p>But the colonel also serves on the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), the UN-backed peacekeeping mission. For this he is much better-paid – earning a few thousand dollars per month. Peacekeeping in Somalia is not for the faint-hearted. Since the country descended into a more or less continuing state of anarchy in 1991, it has harboured fighting clans, factions and terrorists. Amisom forces regularly clash with Al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaida-inspired group behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/kenya-mall-attack-bodies\" title=\"\">last month's deadly attack on Kenya</a>.</p><p>Al-Shabaab are now the main cause of instability in Somalia, and instability in Somalia means instability in the whole region. Our colonel – like most people who care about security in Burundi and the rest of East Africa – is concerned about the state of Somalia. \"I would like to see peace in Somalia,\" the colonel says. \"But not yet. Not until I've finished building my house.\"</p><p>The truth is that instability in Somalia has costs and it has benefits. The fact that Al-Shabaab is able to use large parts of the country as a terrorist training ground presents a horrific cost. Not least&nbsp;the death of 67 innocent people at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi when members laid siege, gunning down families as they sat at cafes and shopped at the supermarket.</p><p>The benefits, however, are financial, immediate and far-reaching. One senior Kenyan politician told me that Somalia is a \"free-for-all\", giving foreign powers the legitimacy to maintain a military presence in the country and control over the lucrative trade in commodities such as charcoal – once a major source of income for Al-Shabaab.</p><p>And so there was little protest when European donors meeting in Brussels last month decided that the time was right to pledge an extra £1.5bn for \"rebuilding the nation\", despite the fact that, according to a UN group of experts <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/413\" title=\"\">[download pdf document]</a>, 80% of withdrawals from Somalia's central bank are known to be used for private purposes and not for the running&nbsp;of government.</p><p>Former Conservative party leader Michael Howard has just spearheaded Somalia's first new oil deal, despite the widely held view that chaos still reigns in its natural resource sector. Howard, who is non-executive chairman of new company Soma Oil and Gas, signed the deal in Mogadishu in August, months after the Somali government said the fragile state was not yet ready for oil exploration, and the UN warned such deals could \"threaten peace and security\".</p><p>The US has recommended the arms embargo on Somalia be lifted despite the fact that Somalia has no proper warehousing, chain of custody or management system for weapons. Recommendations that the UN conduct systematic asset-freezing of senior Al-Shabaab figures at the heart of the murky trade and transactions in and out of significant parts of Somalia have been largely ignored.</p><p>Into this fray steps a woman – originally from the UK – whose story as&nbsp;told in the British press is such an enthralling mix of the exotic, the horrific and the familiar that the ensuing intrigue can almost single-handedly power the Twittersphere. Enter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/kenya-mall-attack-samantha-lewthwaite-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">Samantha Lewthwaite</a>, aka the \"white widow\", a British convert to Islam whose husband Germaine Lindsay killed 22 in the London 7/7 bomb attacks. She fascinates in the way that white women who wear hijab generally do – I've seen them stared at on the tube in London – and because we still don't believe that women can be terrorists.</p><p>Lewthwaite has caught the imagination of the Kenyan press for some time, since police disrupted an alleged terrorist ring she was financing, but somehow allowed Lewthwaite to escape, believing she was an innocent tourist.</p><p>But far from being anything so straightforward, Lewthwaite is a series of apparent contradictions. Born in Northern Ireland, her father fought against the IRA, yet the cause she has chosen is jihadism. When Lindsay blew himself up on the Piccadilly line, she described the attack as \"horrific\", but it seems what she actually believes is that his act of terrorism was a sacrifice which meant that for her, \"the hereafter promised to be sweeter\".</p><p>The ratings appeal of a character such as Lewthwaite is obvious. You only have to&nbsp;look as far as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\" title=\"\">Homeland</a> – an entire series based around our fascination with western-born, white jihadist terrorists, which returns to UK screens this weekend – to find evidence of this. One character in the hit US show, which centers on a US marine who turns into a would-be suicide bomber, is&nbsp;Aileen Morgan, an American woman who plays a key role in a terrorist plot.</p><p>\"She has the face of an angel, but she's a killer,\" <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324050304578412842016016234.html\" title=\"\">the US press cooed</a>, presumably referring to the fact that actress Marin Ireland, who plays Morgan, is blonde-haired and blue-eyed, which is not how terrorists are supposed to look.</p><p>There are plenty of Somali-Brits, Somali-Canadian and other Somali dual citizens suspected of involvement with Al-Shabaab, but they are black and Somali-looking, and therefore their capacity for violence is apparently less&nbsp;surprising.</p><p>Nor is it just the fact that Lewthwaite is a woman that makes her story so unique. On the FBI's most wanted list of&nbsp;terrorists is also Assata Shakur, a 65-year-old grandmother who has been hiding in Cuba for decades after she was alleged to have been involved in the shooting of a US state trooper – an involvement she has always denied. It is&nbsp;the fact that Lewthwaite is a white convert to Islam that fascinates.</p><p>The media obsession with Lewthwaite reminds me of something that has irritated me for years: I cannot name a major Hollywood film set in Africa that does not involve a white American as the main character. This goes back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76474/zulu\" title=\"\">Zulu</a> – ostensibly about the&nbsp;Anglo-Zulu war, but really about Michael Caine; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80796/out-of-africa\" title=\"\">Out of Africa</a> – set in Kenya but really about Meryl Streep and Robert Redford; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108400/lord.of.war\" title=\"\">Lord of War</a> – set in Liberia but really about Nicholas Cage; Tears of the Sun – set in Nigeria but really about Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/116778/blood.diamond\" title=\"\">Blood Diamond</a> – set in Sierra Leone but&nbsp;really about Leonardo Di Caprio … the list goes on. Even Amistad – a film specifically about the impact on Africans of the transatlantic slave trade – is as much a film about the character played by Anthony Hopkins than it is about any African slave.</p><p>Samantha Lewthwaite is the white, western character we need in order to&nbsp;remain interested in a story that is primarily African. That is not to suggest her role in the Westgate attack was pure fiction. Like many other journalists in&nbsp;Kenya during the aftermath of the attack – trying to sift through the uncontrollable stream of fact and fiction&nbsp;emanating from its tragic ruins, I&nbsp;heard credible reports of a white, female jihadist wielding a gun.</p><p>One witness said he saw two white women with weapons directing the attack. There were reports in the Kenyan press of a white woman smearing herself with blood so that she looked like one of the more than 1,000 innocent people injured or caught up in the attack, desperately trying to escape.</p><p>Whether or not she was involved in the Westgate attack, Lewthwaite is already wanted for terrorist offences in Kenya and is believed to be hiding in Somalia. It's the kind of place the most wanted woman in the world would choose to hide out, because despite two&nbsp;decades and millions of dollars in aid, years of training the military, the arms embargos, UN monitoring, expert recommendations and reports, it remains in a state of chaos. That, of course is the real story. But it does not have the face of an angel.</p>","headline":"From Zulu to the 'White Widow', why do all African stories need a white face?","trailText":"<strong>Afua Hirsch</strong>: Samantha

And like many locals, he has grown increasingly angry at the events at the Westgate shopping centre, and the potential impact the four-day siege will have on his community.</p><p>\"What happened in Westgate is terrible. The community in Eastleigh want to help – we have given food and supplies. But I think it is the police, not terrorists, who killed people,\" says Abdul.</p><p>\"Al-Shabaab exist, but they are in Somalia, not here. This is a cover-up motivated by politics. I don't trust the authorities – I think they exploded everything in Westgate to destroy the&nbsp;evidence.\"</p><p>From the other side of the salon, where he is shaving a client's head, Bashir chimes in: \"The worst al-Shabaab can do is a suicide bombing – not something like this that goes on for days.</p><p>\"Now they are blaming Somalis, when we are still not sure who these people are. People are mixing up Muslims with terrorists. You have to differentiate.\"</p><p>There is widespread distrust of the authorities in Eastleigh. Locals say the police have failed to investigate a string of bombings in the neighbourhood, which have killed and injured dozens.</p><p>Many believe the bombings were carried out by Somali militants – but Eastleigh residents have also suffered bloody reprisals from other Kenyans who blame the Somali community for the terrorist attacks.</p><p>At a medical centre in the neighbourhood, the young receptionist dressed in a black hijab becomes agitated as she describes seeing police round up Somalis. She believes the arrests were linked to Westgate.</p><p>\"When people saw the police coming, they were running away,\" says Naima. \"How can they be going around arresting Somalis when we are not even sure if it was Somalis who attacked the place?\"</p><p>Sitting next to her, Ilham, 25, who wears a green hijab, says she believes the gunmen who stormed Westgate were not members of al-Shabaab, and that the description of it as a terrorist attack is part of a state cover-up.</p><p>\"The threat from al–Shabaab is being exaggerated,\" said Ilham. \"There is nothing like al-Shabaab in Kenya. Al-Shabaab are taking responsibility to look bigger than they are.\"</p><p>\"Business is booming in Eastleigh, and people don't like it,\" says Naima. \"They want to target us and affect our business. This has to do with politics, not terrorism.\"</p><p>Despite its reputation as a slum, the tightly knit and entrepreneurial Somali community has become a trade hub. Eastleigh's wide avenues are overcrowded and dirty, with rubbish piled high at the roadside and filling puddles of stagnant water. But the area is also dotted with new, high-rise buildings.</p><p>Ahmed Mohamed returned to Kenya after obtaining a degree in London, and now runs a security firm and an association representing 2,000 Somali-Kenyan business owners.</p><p>\"People are coming from Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan to do business here,\" he says. \"Somalis are natural entrepreneurs. It's in our DNA.\"</p><p>Many feel that resentment at Somali-Kenyans' success in business has led outsiders to scapegoat the community for Islamist violence.</p><p>Somali-Kenyans say they are routinely victimised by the Christian majority. Naima says that when she travelled to Kenya's Rift Valley she was subject to harassment and called names.</p><p>\"When I went to Rongai wearing [a hijab] they were pointing at me and calling me 'al-Shabaab'. When I go to a bus station, they will check me two or three times, but a Christian won't be checked at all. I am a Kenyan. Why would you do that? It is radicalising people.\"</p><p>Eastleigh has been the focus of repeated attacks. Last year six people were killed in a grenade attack on a  minibus, which was followed by violence and looting. Somali-Kenyans were blamed for the blast, even though it happened within their own community.</p><p>\"We are naturally worried about retaliatory attacks,\" says Mohamed. \"Every time something like this happens, we experience the backlash. This time we have donated food to the Kenyan Defence Force, to the fire brigade and the police, to show we are not part of the problem.\"</p><p>Local MP Yusuf Hassan, who was confined to a wheelchair after a bomb attack during general elections in March, says not enough has been done to strengthen relations with the Somali community.</p><p>\"We have been assured by the leadership that ethnic profiling and collective punishment of Somalis is no longer acceptable, but the government should deal with this issue in a more systematic way,\" he says.</p><p>\"The majority of Kenyan people, they do not subscribe to that kind of mentality. But for a minority, whenever the terrorists are mentioned, the word 'Somali', the word 'Muslim', appears.</p><p>\"In the past two years, there have been 11 bomb attacks in my constituency. Yet there have been no arrests, and not one single person brought to court. What does that tell you about the state of the investigations?</p><p>\"The government told us it was al-Shabaab and that that was the end of the story. It's not good enough.\"</p>","headline":"Kenya's Somalis fear violent backlash in the wake of Westgate terror attack","trailText":"Muslim minority in Eastleigh area of Nairobi dispute al-Shabaab link

patchy official information and shallow media coverage, Kenyans have been forced to address the government directly","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T05:10:51Z","body":"<p>Westgate was a magnet for Kenya's moneyed classes, a mall that represented the three Cs of aspirational Nairobi: cosmopolitanism, capitalism and consumerism. Before it became a battlefield this week, it was a playground. Its sushi restaurant had the city's finest cocktail bar, while next door the multiplex cinema served a diet of Hollywood and Bollywood that reflected the mixed heritage of its regulars. The ground floor Artcaffe coffee shop with its dark wood decor was a hangout for celebrities, politicians, diplomats and expatriates. Conversations over cappuccinos on the terrace stretched from gossip about TV stars and property deals to funding for aid projects.</p><p>In a city where a third of the population lives in overcrowded slums with no running water or electricity, the Israeli-owned mall, which opened in 2007, was a fantasy land that insulated its visitors from the harsh reality of other, poorer people's lives. Even the drumbeat of security bulletins warning expatriates that it was a likely target for terrorists did little to diminish its appeal. To get there they would run the friendly gauntlet along Peponi Road, where ragged-trousered squatters would surround the shiny 4x4s, selling everything from flowers to wire sculptures and live puppies.</p><p>The events of Saturday, when a group of terrorists invaded the mall and began a four-day siege, killing more than 70 people and wounding nearly 200 others, have swept this away. Ghanaian poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/westgate-mall-kofi-awoonor\" title=\"\">Kofi Awoonor</a>, who was in Nairobi to attend a literary festival, was killed in the attack, as were Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta's nephew and his fiancée. Ruhila Adatia-Sood, a popular radio and TV presenter, who was six months pregnant, was gunned down at a children's cooking festival taking place on the rooftop. The car park where she died has gone, collapsed into the bowels of the building in what will be a tomb of an unknown number of victims and militants until forensic scientists finish their work.</p><p>Local media coverage of the attack reflected society's shock. It was portrayed as an unprecedented and unanticipated event – although this is not the first time Kenya has been confronted with terrorism on this scale. In 1998, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/aug/08/kenya.garyyounge\" title=\"\">militants linked to Osama bin Laden bombed the United States embassy</a> in the central business district of Nairobi. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/28/israel.kenya\" title=\"\">2002, an Israeli-owned hotel</a> in the coastal city of Mombasa was attacked.</p><p>However, terrorist threats have escalated since October 2011, when Kenya sent its army to southern Somalia to crush the Islamic militia that was blamed for a spate of kidnappings of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. The defence forces managed to oust al-Shabaab from key towns, including its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia\" title=\"\">port city stronghold of Kismayo</a>.</p><p>Away from the glare of the international media that has been fascinated by the atrocity at Westgate, a series of small-scale attacks have, since the incursion, slowly claimed scores of lives. Along Kenya's border with Somalia and in the Somali-dominated Eastleigh neighbourhood of Nairobi, churches have had grenades thrown into them and minibuses full of commuters have been blown up.</p><p>Kenya's own media has been lauded at home for giving a blow-by-blow account of the siege at the mall but it fell short on analysis and investigative reporting. Few outlets bothered to follow up on the disturbing allegation by a witness that one of the terrorists had changed his clothing and slipped out of the mall with some of the hostages, undetected by police.</p><p>Conflicting official reports about the identity of the attackers were also taken at face value. Government and security officials claimed all the terrorists were men, but did not identify those they said had been killed or those that were in their custody. The foreign minister then gave an interview in which she said one of the militants was a woman who had done these things \"many times before\", triggering more speculation.</p><p>The attack did at least deliver a much-needed sense of unity and patriotism in this ethnically and politically polarised country. While the siege rumbled on, Kenyans on Twitter created the hashtag #WeAreOne that was picked up as a slogan by broadcasters and newspapers. But the bravado has largely obscured the lack of credible or authoritative information about the attacks, which prompted ordinary Kenyans to anonymously post questions on the internet via a Google document addressed to the government. One of the questions was: \"Where are the photos of the dead terrorists?\"</p><p>There are difficult and disconcerting questions to be answered about recent lapses in security – including a bizarre fire that gutted Nairobi's international airport last month – that remain unanswered.</p><p><em>Rasna Warah is a columnist with the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading daily newspaper.

the British mother being Interpol's most wanted, the Kenyan prime minister has admitted he has no concrete evidence of Lewthwaite's involvement","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T05:10:56Z","body":"<p>When a group of masked and heavily armed fighters rampaged through a Kenyan shopping centre last Saturday, shooting dead scores of shoppers, one question for the tabloid media became irresistible: had they been funded, perhaps even directed, by a 29-year-old British mother?</p><p>When a number of witnesses described a white woman among the terrorists, was it Samantha Lewthwaite they had seen, the youngest daughter of a British soldier from Aylesbury, the shy, gawky schoolgirl who \"all the teachers loved\"?</p><p>Those questions have been preoccupying investigators – as well as the media – since the attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall, for which the Somali jihadist group al-Shaabab claimed responsibility. Lewthwaite was nicknamed the White Widow after it emerged last year that the Muslim convert, who was married to the 7 July bomber Jermaine Lindsay at the time of the 2005 attacks, was being hunted by Kenyan police in connection with an alleged 2011 bomb plot.</p><p>Lewthwaite had expressed shock after the London bombings, saying she \"totally abhorred\" her husband's actions and telling journalists she and the couple's two children were \"victims as well\". But she disappeared, apparently severing all contact with her family, before resurfacing in Kenya as an important member, according to counter-terrorist officials, of the Somali terror group. Handwritten notes found by the Kenyan police in 2012 and attributed to her claimed her children wanted to become jihadi fighters.</p><p>Who is Samantha Lewthwaite and, more urgently, where is she now? Despite the firestorm of interest in the Briton since the Nairobi atrocity – fuelled on Tuesday when Kenya's foreign minister said a British woman who had \"done this many times before\" had been involved, and by Interpol issuing an international warrant for Lewthwaite's arrest – the Kenyan prime minister has admitted he had no concrete evidence of her involvement in the shopping mall slaughter. Privately and in public, security sources in Britain and Kenya have cautioned against jumping to conclusions. \"I think the role of Samantha Lewthwaite in these attacks has been overblown to cover up what we [the Kenyan security forces] did wrong here,\" said Colonel Benjamin Muema, a Nairobi-based security expert. \"I have not seen any evidence linking her to this attack.\"   Stig Jarle Hansen, a Norwegian academic and security adviser who has written extensively on the Somali terror group, agreed, saying: \"This is a mother on the run with little military or technical expertise, certainly compared to a lot of al-Shabaab activists, some of whom have been in the battlefield for 10 years. Why would they use a person like that [for this kind of attack]?\"</p><p>But as the Interpol red notice demonstrated, Lewthwaite's arrest is an urgent priority for the authorities in Kenya and the British anti-terrorist officers assisting them. \"We cannot rule out that Lewthwaite played a role in this,\" one international intelligence source told the Guardian, saying female al-Shabaab sympathisers played an \"essential role\" in funding and supplying terrorist cells in Somalia.</p><p>Lewthwaite spent her earliest years in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, where her English soldier father Andy married a local woman before the family moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Schoolfriends have spoken of a popular and \"very, very clever\" girl who as a teenager went to a lot of parties, before becoming increasingly interested in religion, and finally converting to Islam in her late teens.</p><p>She had enrolled at university in London when she met Lindsay at an anti-war demonstration, and the pair married in 2002 when she was 19 and he 17. She was eight months pregnant with their second child when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly line train killing 26 people.</p><p>Senior detectives who interviewed Lewthwaite after the bombings say they saw nothing to indicate she had been radicalised, though she had met her husband's fellow bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan. She returned to Aylesbury, but began travelling abroad a lot, according to a friend. In 2009 she gave birth to a third child in the town, leaving the father's name blank on the birth certificate. Shortly afterwards, she disappeared.</p><p>The facts about her in the years that followed are not easy to separate from the rumours. She narrowly escaped arrest in December 2011 over the bomb plot for which she is being sought and fellow Briton Jermaine Grant is being tried in Mombasa. Using a faked South African passport in the name Natalie Webb, she is also believed to have spent time in Johannesburg raising funds (and running up large debts). British counter-terror officials believe she also travelled between Pakistan, Somalia and the UK building a support network.</p><p>A picture posted online shows Lewthwaite embracing Habib Ghani, a British al-Shabaab fighter whom she may have married and with whom she may have had a fourth child.</p><p>Ghani, known as al-Britani, was killed this month in east Africa in an internal al-Shabaab power struggle. But the evidence for other some of the acts attributed to Lewthwaite may remain elusive. Though Kenyan police named her as a suspect in a grenade attack in Mombasa during the Euro 2012 football tournament which killed three people, and Grant's trial was abruptly switched to a secure court in March after the prosecutor said he believed Lewthwaite was plotting to storm the courthouse to free her alleged associate, it is notable that the Interpol warrant specifies only charges of possession of explosives and conspiracy to carry out bombing attacks – the same charges Grant is facing. Neither the Euro 2012 nor the Nairobi attacks are mentioned.</p><p>The terror group has been keen to talk up her role, with online postings praising her as \"our dada mzungu\" (white sister in Swahili), \"an example to us all\" and claiming she has trained an all-female terror cell. But Hansen said he believes Lewthwaite may have become a Scarlet Pimpernel figure in al-Shabaab, a mythic figure whose reputation may not fully reflect her significance.</p><p>If so, he said, the enormous press speculation over her involvement could represent a propaganda victory for the terror group. \"I think her operational position would be limited. But her symbolic value for al-Shabaab is very large, because she's prominent in the media and because she is a convert. She's the daughter of a soldier who they attracted away from the western lifestyle. Her value to al-Shabaab is symbolic – which should not be understated.\"</p>","headline":"Authorities 'cannot rule out' Samantha Lewthwaite played role in mall attack","trailText":"Despite the British

If proved, this would not be the first time radical Islamism had made its presence felt in Norway. Islamist individuals and groups have received substantial attention from the security police. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/23/norway-attacks\" title=\"\">terrorist attacks in Norway on 22 July</a> two years ago, the police were criticised for having prioritised these groups over radical rightwing extremists. Radical Islamism has been one of several issues in the Norwegian immigration debate, but has never been the dominant theme. That said, Progress party politicians have frequently criticised the Norwegian government for being too soft on people with links to radical networks such as Profetens Umma. Earlier this year, Robert Eriksson, now the minister of labour, was furious that a central person in that group had been in receipt of benefits and demanded an immediate halt to all social security payments to persons with extremist connections.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it is safe to say that any allegation of terrorist activities by a Norwegian citizen would lead to a strong reaction from the Progress party. If the suspicions turn out to be true, the party will have to deal with the issue from a different angle. They now have control over the ministry of justice.</p><p>This means that the populist right party also has responsibility for immigration regulation. Progress's entry into government received international attention, and to get rid of its reputation as a radical rightwing party, it even organised a press conference for foreign correspondents in Norway, to clarify the \"misunderstanding\" that they were anti-immigrant.</p><p>There is no doubt that the immigration issue has been central to the rise and popularity of the Progress party. The rhetoric has been unmistakably anti-immigrant. However, the party has a broad portfolio of other policies, such as the lowering of taxes and improving healthcare. It is moderate when compared with other groups of its ilk. Since the shift of leadership in from Carl I Hagen to Siv Jensen in 2006, it has taken further steps in that direction. And the terrorist attacks by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik</a> have seen it tone down the anti-immigration rhetoric down to a bare minimum.</p><p>The new government's immigration platform is also far more moderate than many had feared. It includes some restrictions, such as on family immigration, but also clear instances of liberalisation for other categories of migrant.</p><p>Progress cabinet members are all from the moderate wing of the party, an indication that they are attempting to take on the mantle of a serious and responsible party of the right.</p><p>But despite the moderate leadership, certain outspoken politicians make it difficult to paint a credible picture of Progress as a mainstream party.

How Clouseau-like we must seem to al-Shabaab","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T05:10:54Z","body":"<p>Psst! I'm working on a crazy theory here. It's maverick, it's unconventional, and if it doesn't pan out it's likely to get my superior officer to bust my ass all the way back to whatever constitutes the armchair intelligence community's equivalent of traffic duty. But here goes: a vague feeling in my waters suggests that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/interpol-arrest-warrant-samantha-lewthwaite-white-widow\" title=\"\">\"white widow\" Samantha Lewthwaite</a> was not the field commander of the Nairobi shopping mall attack, in which at least 72 people died and scores more are still missing.</p><p>It may be foolishly early to call this one, in which case what follows will only destroy this column's hard-won reputation as the cognoscenti's absolute first port of call on all matters of international intelligence. But did you ever hear anything so fishy in all your life?</p><p>That Ms Lewthwaite should already have been immortalised as the \"white widow\" is not wholly surprising. The infantilising position of much of the media is that the British public couldn't possibly understand or be interested in such a trivial event as a massacre that held the world's eyes for days, unless it is bowdlerised into something with catchy names. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/white-widow-samantha-lewthwaite\" title=\"\">white widow is a newly hatched relative of that old media staple, the black widow</a> – AKA any woman involved in any sort of violent crime, ever.</p><p>Still, the hysterical speculation linking Lewthwaite to the al-Shabaab attack would surely have eventually fizzled out through lack of factual nourishment, had Interpol not obligingly issued an international arrest warrant for her on Thursday, making her what the Sun now dubs WORLD'S MOST WANTED (and if the paper really thinks she'd be a bigger scalp than the architects of various genocides, or even whichever unfortunate is currently <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/eliminating-al-qaedas-no-3-again/?_r=0\" title=\"\">occupying the ejector seat that is the al-Qaida No&nbsp;3 position</a>, then that is a matter for them).</p><p>You do have to take your hat off to Interpol, which somewhat undeservedly exists in the popular imagination as an elite, global crime-busting unit. I suspect it's a lot to do with the name, which combines the sense of a state-of-the-art technical network with the plosive sound of justice. It's certainly not to do with its more prosaic activities, which last year are alleged to have involved issuing an arrest warrant at the request of the Saudi government for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/10/interpol-journalist-arrested-muhammad-tweet\" title=\"\">blogger who tweeted that he wouldn't pray for Muhammad on the prophet's birthday</a>. Quite why the organisation has obliged the Kenyan authorities with one of their red notices is unclear. They<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/interpol-arrest-warrant-samantha-lewthwaite-white-widow\" title=\"\"> insist it doesn't relate to the attack in Nairobi</a>, and concerns a possession of explosives charge dating back to 2011, so maybe all the hoopla just jogged their memory.</p><p>As for the \"white widow\" – perhaps finger air quotes should be deployed as standard – what do we know about her? Well, she's white (which obviously makes her innately suitable for a management role in the attack) and she is a widow. Specifically, she is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who murdered 26 people on the Piccadilly line.</p><p>One of the many, many encouraging things to emerge via the laser-like focus on Lewthwaite over the past few days has been the phrase \"dropped off the intelligence radar\". According to what security sources seem to have been briefing, the Widow Lindsay was questioned after the attacks but, despite police suspicions, she \"dropped off the intelligence radar\". Or, as the official, redacted version of this assessment hopefully has it, \"dropped off the intelligence radar despite the fact her husband SUICIDE-BOMBED A TRAIN\".</p><p>Thus we find ourselves in a depressing – and depressingly familiar – double bind. If Lewthwaite really is our best lead on Nairobi, you can't help but wonder if we've really got anywhere much over the past few years, in any sense of the word \"intelligence\". And if she isn't, would it be possible to overstate how Clouseau-like we must now appear to al-Shabaab, with our front pages seemingly lost in some misty-eyed obsession with the Bucks-bred, \"angel-faced\" mastermind. Or should that be mistressmind? It's unclear.</p><p>Other things that are unclear? Take your pick, from whether Lewthwaite was even in Kenya at the time of the attack, to why someone \"fitting her description\" (ie, maybe white) was reported to have been in the Westgate shopping centre \"issuing commands\" in Arabic to a bunch of Somalis and Kenyans, who have elsewhere been reported as speaking in English and Swahili to victims.</p><p>The entire thing has taken on the flavour of the worst Ian Blair-era Metropolitan police briefing, where the relationship between the truth and what was being presented as the truth could be so distant that it was perhaps best enjoyed, if you could call it that, as a piece of performance art.</p><p>Still, perhaps we shall gain greater insight into the precise characteristics of the \"white widow\" when the \"global tripwire\" laid by Interpol finally apprehends her. Do let's hope they're not as bathetically disappointing as the characteristics of her distant namesake.</p><p>As tends to be the way of these things, you see, the popular assumptions surrounding the behaviour of black widow spiders are somewhat exaggerated. In so few of the numerous different species of black widow does the female routinely kill the male after mating, that the entire \"black widow\" section of the public imagination is often described by experts as more myth than fact.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde\" title=\"\"><em>@MarinaHyde</em></a></p>","headline":"The 'white widow', like the black, looms larger in the imagination than in fact","trailText":"<p><strong>Marina Hyde:</strong> Samantha Lewthwaite is 'world's most wanted' despite any hard evidence.

Ever since October 2011, when 4,000-odd Kenyan troops were summarily dispatched across to the border into Somalia with a mandate to hunt down and destroy al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group has been promising a massive, bloody revenge. Although it was always tempting to dismiss al-Shabaab's hyperbole as empty, Comical Ali-style bluster, the group has form when it comes to revenge.</p><p>Remember it is only three years since the last major terrorist attack in Africa, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/12/uganda-bombs-blasts-world-cup\">76 died in twin bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala</a> as they watched the World Cup final. This was in direct response to Uganda's military intervention in Somalia, involving thousands of Ugandan soldiers operating under the aegis of the African Union Mission in Somalia.</p><p>Of course, being warned is not the same as being able to prevent these kinds of attacks. Nairobi's gunmen were clearly inspired by the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, which analysts said at the time could be the template for terrorism of the future. Easier and cheaper than bombs, requiring just a handful of machine guns, plenty of ammo and a few men (and, in Nairobi, at least one woman) willing to die for their cause. And without going on full, permanent lockdown, what can cities do to prevent such an attack?</p><p>Still, in the light of this weekend's tragic scenes, it is worth revisiting Kenya's sudden decision to get itself involved in Somalia. Unlike Uganda's internationally approved military support for Somalia's fragile central government (along with troops from Burundi, and more recently Djibouti and Sierra Leone), Kenya's was a unilateral intervention that took everyone by surprise. And their goal was less about restoring stability in Somalia and more about wiping out al-Shabaab and establishing a de facto buffer state between the two countries, a buffer state it hoped would keep Somalia's instability from spilling over its borders and threatening Kenya's vital tourism and shipping industries.</p><p>Before Kenya went to war that is exactly what had been happening. In the absence of any effective government, piracy in Somalia flourished, as did kidnappings for ransom. As pickings grew slim in Somalia itself, the pirates, kidnappers and militant groups trying to fund their operations looked further afield, with Kenyan tourist resorts – flush with wealthy western tourists – identified as perfect targets. Two foreigners were taken from two different coastal resort towns, while another two foreign aid workers were abducted from a refugee camp near the Somali border. The future for Mombasa port was also looking grim, with shipping companies looking for alternative destinations that would take them out of pirate range. Along with the flood of Somali refugees into Kenya, this was all too much for the country's unpopular government of national unity (who would also have welcomed the distraction from their own governance record and the popular approval boost that so often accompanies major military action).</p><p>And so Kenyan troops were sent in to one of Africa's most intractable conflicts. Al-Shabaab, then in control of most of Somalia (and alleged to have participated in some of the Kenyan kidnappings) was the obvious target.</p><p>Kenya's involvement was welcomed cautiously by the African and international diplomatic community, and has fundamentally altered the balance of power in Somalia. Whereas Amisom's approach was essentially defensive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia\">Kenya went straight on the attack and ousted al-Shabaab</a> from most of its important strongholds, including its de facto capital in the port city of Kismayo. It allowed the federal government in Mogadishu to extend its reach and gave Amisom the encouragement it needed to secure Mogadishu properly, which explains the mini renaissance some say the city is currently enjoying (including hip restaurants, ice cream shops and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/somalia-tedx-mogadishu-recovery\"> TEDx talks</a>).</p><p>The pressure has hit al-Shabaab hard. Divisions in the group deteriorated into infighting, with several prominent defections. It has lost plenty of territory it once controlled, although it still remains in charge of vast swathes of the country. This pressure, ironically, may explain the timing and the spectacular nature of the Nairobi attack this weekend. In the face of fading influence, it is fighting to stay relevant and remain in the headlines.</p><p>Subsequent to the unilateral invasion, Kenyan troops were folded into Amisom and given a seal of international approval. Yet this retrospective legitimisation could not disguise that their intervention was in fact an invasion, and that the risk of blowback was always going to be high, especially when it became clear that Kenya's involvement was seriously hurting al-Shabaab.</p><p>On that front, al-Shabaab has delivered. Kenya's leaders now have some serious, difficult questions to ask themselves. Why is Kenya in Somalia? Is it worth staying? How likely are repeat attacks? Crucially, with President Uhuru Kenyatta already promising to \"punish\" those responsible, they need to ask whether sending even more troops in Somalia, with an even more aggressive mandate, is the best way to protect Kenyan citizens in the long run.</p><p>Also important for everyone to remember is that al-Shabaab's actions do not define Somalia, or Somalis (after all, al-Shabaab's primary target has always been Somalis themselves). Kenya has a sizeable Somali population and an entire suburb (Eastleigh) that is known as the Somali district. This has previously been the site of xenophobic violence, with Kenyans targeting Somalis in response to other attacks attributed to al-Shabaab. Kenya's leaders have a duty to remind their citizens that this is not acceptable.</p><p>There is also a worry that this tragedy will be used as a bargaining chip in the trials of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/kenya-deputy-president-william-ruto-icc-murder\">Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto</a>, at the International Criminal Court. Already Ruto has requested that the court delay his trial so that he can deal with the aftermath of the massacre and there are rumours that Kenyatta wants to use it to bolster his argument that he is unable to attend his trial in person.</p><p>In the middle of this ongoing tragedy, Kenya needs good leadership more than ever. This is Kenyatta and Ruto's chance to show they can provide it, even if they haven't in the past. They owe the Westgate victims at least that much.</p>","headline":"Nairobi terror attack: why Kenya and why now?","trailText":"<p>Despite subsequent UN legitimacy, Kenya's intervention in Somalia was

The preferred term is a \"revert\". The idea is that Islam is the natural state of man (or woman) until their parents interfere and make them one thing or another.</p><p>It has on occasion been patiently explained to me – a convert to Islam at the age of 18 – that the relative ease with which someone can convert to Islam shows just how open the community is to converts, regardless of their race, background, bank balance or life history.</p><p>It's been an appealing selling point, drawing on the early days of Islam in the deserts of seventh century Arabia – a time when an egalitarian spirit that embraced slaves and sinners is said to have prevailed.</p><p>And the theory has found favour with some of the most famous converts to Islam – from the black consciousness leader Malcolm X to the great Leopold Weiss, known in the Muslim world as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad\" title=\"\">Muhammad Asad</a>. The famous feminist Muslim scholar, Amina Wadud, is a convert to Islam, as was the historian and recorder of the Muslim pilgrimage, \"Harry\" St John Philby.</p><p>These are names worlds away from the likes of the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/white-widow-samantha-lewthwaite\" title=\"\">white widow, Samantha Lewthwaite</a>, whose notoriety has gone up several notches following reports linking her with the attacks in Kenya. She has captured the imagination, despite there being no firm evidence of her involvement in the atrocity.</p><p>Though she may be an aberration – with the Muslim community predictably reacting with shock at having unwittingly harboured her – Lewthwaite's story isn't unique.</p><p>Her apparent drift to extremism, after some perfectly ordinary early years \"within the fold\", though definitely exceptional in its nature and extent, partly reflects the reality found among many more converts to Islam than we might care to admit.</p><p>Frightened that the acceptance they so crave might never come, they may find themselves constantly needing to prove their bona fides to people sceptical of their ability to be \"real Muslims\" after a previous life presumed to have been loaded with hedonism and sin.</p><p>Biographers write of Muhammad Asad's disbelief when his English translation of the Qur'an – instead of being hailed, was dismissed by other Islamic scholars as the work of a \"mere Jew\". In a need to prove that they're not \"just a convert\" – simple propagation or da'wah is seen as inadequate – some inevitably gravitate towards ideas rejected by the mainstream.</p><p>And there is, in some Muslim communities, little of the kind of pastoral care found in the Christian church, where a believer can take their problems to  a sympathetic priest. Many converts, unless they have married into the community, once the initial novelty has died down, find themselves alone and alienated, \"rebels in search of a cause\".</p><p>You will find them, desperate to find some meaning in the journey they have undertaken. Some find it in Sufism. Others in jihad – immersing themselves in the writings of the likes of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb\" title=\"\">Sayyid Qutb</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_A%27la_Maududi\" title=\"\">Abul A'la Maududi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml\" title=\"\">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> – the godfathers of the Islamic movement. Because of their need to prove themselves, they are the impressionable types targeted by fringe groups looking for recruits.</p><p>Interviewing female converts to Islam in London as part of a film project in 2004, I chanced upon a group from Regent's Park mosque keen to share their views on everything from bikinis to stoning for adultery. One woman, a second-time divorcee whom I shall name Aimee, did not blink as she told the camera (in a heavy Scottish brogue) she would pick up the first stone to lob at her own daughter if she was found guilty of crimes against Allah.</p><p>Her chilling words reminded me of the story of Margaret Marcus, an ordinary Jewish girl from New York, who became <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Jameelah\" title=\"\">Maryam Jameelah</a>, one of the most famous (or infamous) polemicists on radical Islam and jihad of the last century.</p><p>Because we have yet to hear Lewthwaite speak from the dock – or have her explain the motives behind her alleged crimes, it is conjecture to suggest she was radicalised because her initial attempts at integration were rebuffed. But it's a reasonable assumption.</p><p>It is said that western women are converting to Islam in record numbers. A popular narrative, of a Damascene moment of some kind, is weaved by poster girls like Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth (and myself at one point) telling of how we turned our backs on the materialism and nihilism of the west to find our true calling beneath the hijab. In \"embracing\" our new faith we say we were embraced in turn.</p><p>The reality, however, is somewhat more complex. Converts seeking a bread-and-butter Muslim existence, of mosque attendance, raising children, praying and fasting, readily fit into the communities they choose to attach themselves to.</p><p>But those Muslim women seeking a more cerebral experience soon find themselves isolated in communities that are often insular and intolerant of a reinterpretation of the scriptures that might give more meaning to someone born and raised in the west.</p><p>There are those converts like Lewthwaite who will show you just how committed they really are – by embracing militant Islam. Others leave Islam altogether. Others become more devout. Then there are those like Muhammad Asad, who die disappointed, that despite his best efforts he remained \"a foreign body in contemporary Islam, a transplant rejected time and again by his hosts…\"</p>","headline":"The 'white widow': a Muslim convert 'rebel in search of a cause'?","trailText":"<p><strong>Khadija Magardie: </strong>Samantha Lewthwaite's story may never be fully known,

In targeting a site at the epicentre of elite consumerism in the upscale neighborhood of Westlands, they galvanised worldwide attention. As the media offered us a play-by-play account of the unfolding hostage crisis and my Twitter and Facebook newsfeeds were flooded with declarations of anger and sorrow&#8211;sentiments I of course share&#8211;two things are apparent.</p><p>First, the extent to which the more privileged and educated segments of our world community find certain forms of violence in certain locales to be horrifying and objectionable. Second, the classed and racialised framings that shape our understandings of the issue at hand. Together, these notions work to differentiate between human lives that are worthy of grief, and those that are not.</p><p>What is it about the targeting of innocents on islands of privatised leisure like Westgate that strikes such a strong emotional chord across the world? Is it not that the majority of us who (have the ability to) log in every hour for updates see ourselves in the victims, knowing that we regularly occupy these very spaces?</p><p>Perhaps it is in this vein that we can make sense of the deafening silence in the context of the transnational plundering of neighboring Somalia – a country that readers of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/\">Kenya's Daily Nation</a> have been conditioned to see as representing the antithesis of liberal cosmopolitanism, as requiring external tutelage in the name of \"peace and stability\", and whose ongoing destruction is more commonly understood as the work of Somalis themselves rather than the product of a complex assemblage of internal and external actors with competing political and economic interests.</p><p>How is it that the presence and violence of certain actors in the region&#8211;whether the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) and its African Union \"peacekeeping\" (Amisom) partners in Somalia, or US and Israeli forces \"advising\" the KDF in Nairobi&#8211;is normalised in our collective imaginaries as legitimate, while exceptional violence by non-state actors against upper-class Kenyans and expatriates triggers such immediate outcry?</p><p>Just three months after its invasion of Somalia in October 2011, the Kenyan military reportedly claimed the lives of at least <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201201090805.html\">700</a> Somali \"militants\". UN reports have documented <a href=\"http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=416\">black market sales</a> by peacekeeping troops of arms intended for the Somali government to oppositional groups including al-Shabaab, and Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/14/somalia-stop-war-crimes-mogadishu\">reports of indiscriminate mortar and rocket attacks</a> by Amisom in civilian areas, leading not only to loss of life but also repeated displacement.</p><p>If up to 3,000 Amisom forces <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/05/31/from_blackhawk_down_to_standing_up\">have died since the peacekeeping operation</a> was launched in 2007, one can only imagine what the number of Somali casualties might be. Our implicit acceptance of the ostensible humanitarian logic underlying such destruction amounts to what <a href=\"http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Anthropology/fac_asad.html\">Talal Asad</a> has referred to as the \"<a href=\"http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Anthropology/fac_asad.html\">etiquette of death dealing</a>\", characterised by nods of regret for such \"unfortunate\" loss of life.</p><p>Witnesses to the attack in Nairobi reported that the suspects \"looked like Somalis\" and \"chanted Allahu Akbar as they entered the building\". The spectral and racialised image of the terrifying Muslim (and explicitly non-Kenyan) Somali is here conjured once again to capture liberal anxieties, while the security apparatuses of Kenya, Israel and the United States are visually and rhetorically incorporated into cosmopolitan imaginaries of peace-keeping and secular diplomacy.</p><p>If we are to believe that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/kenya-westgate-shabaab-somali-conflict\">Westgate attack was the work of al-Shabaab</a> as the organisation itself claims, does this not demand consideration that this weekend's tragedy might be a political response to a transnational project of state-sanctioned violence in neighboring Somalia? Is it not Somalia that has been the epicentre of a \"war zone\" and not Westgate mall, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/africa/nairobi-mall-shooting.html%3Fref=africa\">New York Times claims</a>?</p><p>Given the amplified surveillance and suspicion of Kenya's Muslim minorities since 9/11, one can't help but dread how widely the tentacles of this war zone will extend, whether onto the streets of Mombasa or into the homes of Somali immigrants in Eastleigh. The targets of \"just\" violence deemed so integral to secular modernity will be lucky to garner an ounce of the empathy we have all expressed in response to the tragedy at Westgate.</p>","headline":"Nairobi attacks: what about the casualties of Somalia's war zone?","trailText":"<p>How do we differentiate between human lives that are worthy of global outpourings of grief

As Kenyan soldiers launch their assault, pop music is still playing from loudspeakers.</p><p>The grisly consequences of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/kenya-westgate-shabaab-somali-conflict\" title=\"\">attack by al-Shabaab on Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre</a> are still unfolding. As individual families mourn, Kenya is once again counting the cost of its point position as a regional bulwark against militant Islam. The country has been here before: in 1998 <a href=\"http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/080898africa-bombing.html\" title=\"\">al-Qaida bombed the US embassy</a> in the Kenyan capital; and in 2002 a terror attack <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2522207.stm\" title=\"\">against an Israeli-owned passenger aircraft and hotel</a> took place in the coastal city of Mombasa. Westgate, too, is Israeli owned, but this may be less significant than it might appear.</p><p>More important, for the future of Kenya and the continent, are the two competing visions of Africa that the attacks project, a tension for which the crude shorthand is: \"crime versus supermarkets\". Al-Shabaab emerged from the tradition of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifta\" title=\"\"><em>shifta</em></a>, a word long applied in east Africa to common bandits, but also (less frequently, and depending who was speaking) to rebel groups. There is a continuity between the two usages that challenges the tendency to separate terrorism and criminality into discrete phenomena.</p><p>Al-Shabaab is responding, specifically, to Kenyan involvement in a joint African peacekeeping force (Amisom) in Somalia. But like al-Qaida before it (the two groups linked formally in 2011), al-Shabaab is really attacking the very idea of capitalism; not through any greatly developed sense of revolution, but through an inverted sense of what is good for Africa.</p><p>In Kenya crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either. Indeed, the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta (whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/nairobi-attack-kenya-president-nephew\" title=\"\">nephew has been killed in the attack</a>), and the vice-president, William Ruto, both face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to their alleged role in co-ordinating election violence – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/kenya-deputy-president-william-ruto-icc-murder\" title=\"\">Ruto's trial at The Hague</a> has been adjourned for a week to allow him to come home to deal with the crisis.</p><p>These attacks are part of a spectrum of banditry, with corruption at one end, terrorism at the other, and regular robbery in the middle. Some Kenyans will feel that the conditions in which the attacks have happened have arisen because of economic growth in a vacuum of governance. Money that should have been spent on security and other aspects of national infrastructure has been disappearing for generations.</p><p>Corruption as well as geopolitics made possible a horrific situation in which Muslim shoppers in Westgate were apparently left alive and non-Muslims killed, in a ghoulish travesty of the mixed nature of Kenyan identity.</p><p>Ordinary Kenyans rightly want to be able to shop safely, and there is a long history of them doing just that, irrespective of their religion or that of the shop owner. An Ismaili Muslim from Kutch in India, the great Allidina Visram (1851-1916), more or less single-handedly invented the retail trade in Kenya. Muslims have been at the heart of Kenyan commerce for hundreds of years.</p><p>The past decade has seen rapid growth of the Kenyan and other African economies. This story of \"Africa rising\" is intrinsically tied up with the further development of an African middle class, which has brought confidence and investment. A lot of money has gone into commercial property, and particularly the building of supermarkets. But without governance it all looks very shaky.</p><p>You can gesture at the transnational problem of Islamist terrorism all you like, but it's just hot air unless you invest in proper security on the ground in your own country, with the right safeguards to civil liberties. For now Kenya must mourn its dead. But unless the corruption stops, and real investment is made in the social fabric, Kenya will once again be faced with systemic shocks it is hardly able to deal with.</p><p><em>Giles Foden is the author of Zanzibar, and The Last King of Scotland</em></p>","headline":"Kenya: behind the terror is rampant corruption","trailText":"<strong>Giles Foden:</strong> the Kenya attacks should shatter the crude picture of Africa's future as one of crime v supermarkets","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/23/1379962653374/A-soldier-carries-a-child-003.jpg","wordcount":"643","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"418068116","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8108119","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Foden","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1969874","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-26T19:45:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-behind-terror-rampant-corruption","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-behind-terror-rampant-corruption","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/kenya","webTitle":"Kenya","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/kenya","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-shabaab","webTitle":"Al-Shabaab","description":"The latest news and comment on al-Shabaab","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-shabaab","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilesfoden","webTitle":"Giles Foden","rcsId":"GNL026369","r2ContributorId":"15667","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/24/1380025766719/Giles-Foden.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Foden is the author of Zanzibar, and The Last King of Scotland</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesfoden","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/gilesfoden","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/commentanddebate","webTitle":"Comment & debate","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/commentanddebate","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/commentanddebate","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-418069392","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/23/1379962650945/A-soldier-carries-a-child-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"REUTERS","photographer":"Goran Tomasevic","altText":"A soldier carries a child to safety in Nairobi","height":"54","credit":"Goran Tomasevic/REUTERS","caption":"A soldier rescues a child from the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi after it came under attack by armed militants.

The Kenyan military led the operation to free hostages and kill or capture those who had trapped them, and we are proud of the professionalism and determination of our forces.</p><p>Foden says: \"In Kenya crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either.\" And he continues: \"These attacks are part of a spectrum of banditry, with corruption at one end, terrorism at the other, and regular robbery in the middle.\"</p><p>Make a brief comparison with other terrorist attacks. The disasters of 9/11 or the more recent Boston marathon in the US and 7/7 in the UK – both highly developed countries – could hardly be blamed on corruption, so why Kenya? We do not recall Foden blaming corruption within the security agencies involved.</p><p>\"A lot of money has gone into commercial property, and particularly the building of supermarkets. But without governance it all looks very shaky,\" says Foden. But he seems unaware of how much Kenya has changed in the past decade. The country's first truly free and fair multiparty election only took place in 2002, and since then the country has been transformed by a new constitution that gives power to all communities. Less than 10 years ago we introduced free primary education, now over a million children a year go to school.</p><p>Judicial reform, in some cases supported by international experts and donors – including the US and UK – has put the courts out of the political influence that once was common. Anti-corruption campaigns by government and civil society, the requirement for open tenders for government contracts, and the development of a lively media, have transformed the country.</p><p>This is not to say Kenya is perfect – far from it. A multinational forensic investigation currently under way – including with British agents – will examine the tragedy and assess the government's response to it. It shows the extent of our openness that we allow foreign security forces to share in an investigation we could probably manage ourselves.</p><p>At the same time, we will strive to be as open as possible in our actions against al-Qaida and its regional ally al-Shabaab in the coming months, without compromising the security of our country and the safety of our military personnel.</p><p>It is important that there is responsible international reporting. In this age of budget cuts in the international media there are too few foreign journalists with expert experience of Africa living in and reporting from the continent. Kenya suffered a terrible tragedy at Westgate. As information is released in the coming days and weeks, it is crucial – for the sake of the victims and the survivors – that reporting reflects the Kenya of today, and that we are judged by today's reality, not memories of a Kenya past.</p>","headline":"Kenya terror attack: corruption wasn't to blame","trailText":"<strong>Amina Mohamed: Response: </strong>My country has changed much in recent years – it's unfair to place the Westgate attacks on a 'spectrum of banditry'","newspaperPageNumber":"28","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381063978354/Kenyan-Security-Forces-Co-003.jpg","wordcount":"500","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"419179702","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8151203","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Amina Mohamed","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-10-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1976354","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-10T06:00:18Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/kenya-terror-attack-corruption-blame","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/kenya-terror-attack-corruption-blame","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/series/response","webTitle":"Response","description":"The Response column offers those who have been written about in the Guardian an opportunity to reply.

The most senior politicians in the Somali government and parliament, as well as the Somali people at home and abroad, have condemned it in the strongest terms and sent their condolences to the Kenyan people.</p><p>The attack was intended to sow discord and friction among Kenyans and to damage the country's economic success story. But its consequences for Somalia are potentially even more destructive.</p><p>As a result of al-Shabaab being driven out of Somalia's major cities, Somalis are returning from abroad, the economy is booming, the main roads in Mogadishu are being reconstructed, and the airport and port are expanding.</p><p>Westgate was al-Shabaab's revenge on Somalia and the international community that backed it, for defeating them. It was an attempt to persuade the international community not to go on helping Somalia, and thus give al-Shabaab the chance to regain power.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/09/2013923628350977.html\" title=\"\">The justification that al-Shabaab gave to their act was the presence of Kenyan forces in Somalia</a>. Of course, this is totally hypocritical: their ideology is based on denying national statehood, so they are against establishing a Somali state. They dishonour the Somali national flag by flying the black flag of al-Qaida, representing an imaginary global state. And so, purely in order to stir up nationalist feelings, they shed crocodile tears for the loss of Somali sovereignty.</p><p>Nevertheless, the presence of the Kenyan forces there was not invited by Somalia, nor welcomed by the African Union; it has embarrassed the great powers allied to Kenya and is in contravention of international law. This is a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/28/world/africa/kenya-mall-attack-reaction/index.html\" title=\"\">matter of serious concern that threatens to destabilise both Kenya and Somalia</a>.</p><p>Kenya has <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/mobile/?articleID=2000094685&amp;story_title=uhuru-kenya-will-not-withdraw-troops-from-somalia\" title=\"\">bluntly rejected</a> the resolution, reached in Kampala by the African countries that have sent forces to Somalia, <a href=\"http://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Aug/30625/communiqu%C3%A9_meeting_of_the_heads_of_state_and_government_of_the_troop_contributing_countries_of_amisom.aspx\" title=\"\">calling on Kenya to withdraw its forces</a> and to respect Somali sovereignty.</p><p>What is Kenya's interest in south Somalia or Lower Juba? It is the richest area in Somalia for agriculture, fisheries, wildlife, tourist attractions – and oil. There are also oil reserves in the offshore waters. Early in the mandate of the previous transitional government, Kenya persuaded the former Somali president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed to recognise that an area of territorial waters off the Somali coast in fact belonged to Kenya. The attempt was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/06/kenya-somalia-exploration-idUSL6E8I63IM20120706\" title=\"\">thwarted by the Somali parliament</a>.</p><p>Another significant reason that Kenyan forces may be trying to create in Somalia a vassal state – or \"buffer zone\", as the Kenyan government prefers to call it – is to protect its own projects. Kenya is embarking on a multibillion-dollar development around the port of Lamu, just 15km from the border, building roads and railways to give access to Uganda, Ethiopia and South Sudan.</p><p>Somalia has resources that are the envy of the world. There are vast oil and gas deposits on- and off-shore across the country. It is rich in maritime resources, agriculture and rare minerals.</p><p>Somalia and Kenya have a common border of 800km, so our destinies are inextricably linked. Our appeal is not to let extremists divide us, but instead to join forces to fight the common enemy and focus our attention on longer-term interests, based on respect for each other's sovereignty, and the benefits for our future generations of living in peace, stability and prosperity.</p>","headline":"Westgate attack must not divide Kenya and Somalia","trailText":"<strong>Osman Jama Ali and Mohamed Sharif Mohamud: </strong>Somalis condemn al-Shabaab's atrocious attack.
