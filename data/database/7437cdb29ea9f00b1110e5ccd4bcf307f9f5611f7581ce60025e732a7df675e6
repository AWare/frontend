Among the delights on offer are Vaughan Williams's classic Fantasia On A Theme by Thomas Tallis, followed by the neglected These Things Shall Be by John Nicholson Ireland, featuring Radio 3's New Generation Artist bass-baritone Jonathan Lemalu. Also on the bill is Walton's old testament tale Belshazzar's Feast, again featuring the dulcet rumblings of Lemalu. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2>Urban Secrets<br />8pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></h2><p>Alan Cumming's series exploring the corners of British cities reaches London, where the actor strolls from St Paul's to Soho. It all feels somewhat phoned-in: some of the locations could have been dredged up with a quick Google, the script is lazy - a drinking game triggered by the word \"amazing\" could incapacitate before the first ad break - and, aside from a visit to the Sex Pistols' former flat in Denmark Street, Cumming never conveys the impression that his heart's in it. Danny Baker's enlivening cameo prompts bemusement that he wasn't asked to host the whole thing. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><h2><strong>The Churchills</strong><br />8pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>David Starkey concludes his Winston Churchill love-fest with a final look at how the Duke of Marlborough, Churchill's ancestor, influenced the wartime prime minister. Starkey is from the \"great men do great things\" school of history and he relentlessly has Winston controlling events with the ghost of Marlborough by his side, while brushing aside the interplay of other characters. He puts his cards on the table: apparently we need a new Churchill, as we've been groping in the dark ever since Winnie's era ended at the start of the cold war. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Wonderland: Young, Bright And On the Right</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>The last election led to a coalition where nearly 70% of cabinet ministers are Oxbridge-educated. If this latest episode of Wonderland is anything to go by, that production line isn't grinding to a halt any time soon. We follow Chris Monk and Joe Cooke of their respective university conservative associations as they enter an academic term that may well define their political careers. Despite indications early on, there's more beneath the surface of each than plummy vowels and framed Maggie photos, meaning neither Chris nor Joe can be dismissed as little B'stards. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2><strong>America's Animal Hoarder: Horror At The Zoo – True Stories</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>As this True Stories documentary opens and a Chief Wiggum-esque officer tells you that events took place in Zanesville, Ohio, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were embarking on a spoof. In fact, this is the real-life story of a Vietnam war vet who kept a total of 56 dangerous exotic animals in his backyard (a practice perfectly legal in this particular state of America) and then promptly set them free, before killing himself. Disaster, unsurprisingly, ensued. <em>Clare Considine</em></p><h2>The Midnight Beast<br />10pm, E4</h2><p>The Beast's series finale is basically a clips show – one that focuses on The Midnight Beast's famed music videos. Not a bad idea, as the fake promos are probably the most successful aspect of this show. It's never easy for meagre TV budgets to compete with the megabucks music video directors have to chuck around, but these cheap and very cheerful ones manage far better than most. So sit back and enjoy the complete versions of Medium Pimpin', Strategy Wanking and other \"hits\". <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 09/08/2012","trailText":"BBC Proms 2012: A Fantasia Of English Music | Urban Secrets | The Churchills | Wonderland: Young, Bright And On the Right | America's Animal Hoarder: Horror At The Zoo – True Stories | The Midnight Beast","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344434099361/Winston-Churchill---the-c-003.jpg","wordcount":"565","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394394472","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6511247","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ben Arnold, Andrew Mueller, Martin Skegg, Mark Jones, Clare Considine and Phelim O'Neill","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1785053","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-11T18:59:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/08/americas-animal-hoarder-the-churchills","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/08/americas-animal-hoarder-the-churchills","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"music/proms-2012","webTitle":"Proms 2012","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/proms-2012","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/proms-2012","references":[]},{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","webTitle":"Classical music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[{"type":"musicbrainzgenre","id":"musicbrainzgenre/classical"},{"type":"musicbrainzgenre","id":"musicbrainzgenre/modern-classical"}]},{"id":"music/proms","webTitle":"Proms","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/proms","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/proms","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-arnold","webTitle":"Ben Arnold","r2ContributorId":"45285","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-arnold","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-arnold","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrewmueller","webTitle":"Andrew Mueller","rcsId":"GNL330043","r2ContributorId":"22152","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/04/Andrew_Mueller_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Mueller is a journalist and author.

Ash is warned that his randy gland is among the issues causing the fissure, as is Dru's distinct lacking in the same department. A romantic intervention in the caff seems to have a temporary effect, until Dru's new love interest proves less a steadying influence than an obsessive loon. With a hit rate of about one in 20 gags, the sitcom from these YouTube sensations is considerably less likely to grab the 40-odd million views it has had online.  <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2><strong>Natural World:  Tiger Island</strong><br />8pm, BBC2</h2><p>The habitat of the Sumatran tiger has been destroyed by the island's deforestation, turning the majestic creatures, among the last island tigers on the planet, into maneaters. As such they are hunted and killed, or kept captive in desperate conditions. Whether they can be rehabilitated and released back into the wild is unknown territory. But maverick millionaire Tomy Winata is doing just that, releasing the tigers on to his own land with little regard for the village nearby. Is this reckless? Or could it save the species from extinction? <em>BA</em></p><h2><strong>BBC Proms 2012</strong><br />7.30pm, BBC4</h2><p>Conductor Daniel Barenboim leads the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in its Royal Albert Hall romp through Beethoven's symphonies: tonight it's the fifth and sixth. The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra is the altogether admirable ensemble founded in 1999 by the Argentinian-Israeli conductor Barenboim in association with the late Palestinian academic Edward Said and includes musicians from all over the Middle East.     <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><h2><strong>The Churchills</strong><br />8pm, Channel 4</h2><p>One of the Churchills in question is Winston. The other, less well-known today, is his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The Duke's claim to fame was defeating France in the Nine Years' War in the early-18th century. Winston wrote a mammoth biography of Marlborough, which, for historian David Starkey, is crucial to our understanding of the future wartime prime minister, being \"a book about history that changed history\". Starkey gallops through his thesis with an unconcealed gushing admiration for his subjects. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Obsessive Compulsive Hoarder: The Big Clear Out</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4</h2><p>Hoarder Richard Wallace was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, as his collection of clutter threatened to take over his house. The follow-up looks at how he's doing six months later. Despite Andy the landscape gardener rounding up villagers to help with a clearout, there's still an alarming amount of mess. The extent of Richard's hoarding is revealed with the discovery of a \"death tunnel\" that he has to crawl through in his kitchen, prompting Andy to bring in a mental health team for support. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Frontline: The New Asylums</strong><br />9pm, PBS</h2><p>In 2005, when this harrowing documentary was made, fewer than 55,000 mentally ill Americans were being treated in psychiatric hospitals – almost 10 times that number are in jail. Frontline visits Ohio State Penitentiary and sits in on mental health meetings and crisis wards. Such places would be the Bedlam of the 21st century were it not for staff who go above and beyond the call of the ill-equipped prison system, administering decent and appropriate treatment to people who are victims of their country's almost vindictive indifference to social care. <em>David Stubbs</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 26/07/12","trailText":"The Midnight Beast | Natural World: Tiger Island | BBC Proms 2012 | The Churchills | Obsessive Compulsive Hoarder: The Big Clear Out | Frontline: The New Asylums","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/25/1343226239985/Needs-to-up-the-gag-rate--003.jpg","wordcount":"524","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"393587501","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6461928","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ben-arnold\" title=\"\">Ben Arnold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewmueller\" title=\"\">Andrew Mueller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-skegg\" title=\"\">Martin Skegg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/hannah-verdier\" title=\"\">Hannah Verdier</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidstubbs\" title=\"\">David Stubbs</a>","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1778600","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-28T19:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/25/midnight-beast-natural-world-proms","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/25/midnight-beast-natural-world-proms","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp;

This five-part drama tackles police corruption and it's quickly apparent who the dodgy coppers are, as they're much more interesting than the honest ones. It's off to a fine start: in only a few minutes we're knee-deep in botched police raids, faked reports, unreported crimes and cover-ups. This opening episode lays out the numerous characters efficiently, with a few big twists kept for the end. <em>Phelim&nbsp;O'Neill</em></p><h2><strong>Gordon Behind Bars</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Jamie's cornered the school dinner market, so Gordon Ramsay heads to Brixton prison for his do-good mission. His aim is to spend six months teaching the inmates to cook so they can set up a business selling food on the outside. \"None of these reprobates has a clue how to cook,\" he concludes after a disastrous egg-scrambling incident. But he soon gets into his stride, dropping the F-bomb all over the place as his \"bad boy brigade\" bake fairy cakes. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2>Coming Here Soon: Greece, Bust And Broken<br />9pm, BBC3<br /></h2><p>In a new series, Stacey Dooley investigates the consequences of financial meltdown in three countries: Greece, Ireland and Japan. She starts in Greece and soon discovers how bleak things are – unemployment, food handouts, scavenging in Athens. Dooley's presenting style is to get involved and report back how she feels about it; whether this approach provides a reliable analysis of the country's problems is down to whether you prefer touchy feely human interest stories or facts and figures delivered by reporters with serious expressions. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Ethan Hawke On&nbsp;Macbeth</strong><br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>The Hollywood actor takes an in-depth look at the part he's always wanted to play. Those who retch at the sight of thesps earnestly pontificating should look away because Ethan does a lot of brow-furrowing here. Former Macbeths and Lady Macbeths, including Antony Sher and Harriet Walter, describe their approach to the roles, and a curiously Yank-heavy cast of academics discuss the psychology of a guy who skewers a king to death because three crones told him to and his pushy wife wouldn't shut up about it. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2>Hit &amp; Miss<br />10pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></h2><p>The concluding part of the Paul Abbott-created series, bringing home the realities of juggling working life as an assassin with the stresses of being a transsexual raised by fairground folk. Chloë Sevigny doesn't convince in the lead role as Mia but neither is she risible, bringing a seething presence to her part. In this final episode, Mia discovers, at some painful cost, that \"family has nothing to do with blood\". Much music tonight, in an episode whose visual language borders on that of the rock video. If Hit &amp; Miss fails, it at least does so interestingly. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><h2><strong>Imagine</strong><br />10.35pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>Occasionally, Alan Yentob's Imagine films can seem merely decorative, or too in thrall to celebrity culture. In this first film of the new series nothing could be further from the truth: it profiles the production of The Two Worlds Of Charlie F, a new \"documentary play\" that stars veterans of the war in Afghanistan. It's a striking work that uncovers scars physical and mental, personal and political. As one character says: \"When we leave Afghanistan, a little bit of it stays with us, or us with it.\" <em>John Robinson</em></p><p>• This article was amended on 29 June 2012. The original referred to those who wretch at the sight of thesps pontificating.

As Jacques Peretti explains, the former Chicago cinema manager had a big idea: increased portion sizes and cost would lead to increased sales. Via variations such as BOGOF offers, the idea has spread, but at the cost of our waistlines. So why don't we stop super-sizing ourselves? Peretti's documentary suggests one answer lies where you might expect – in big corporations' drive for profits.  <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>The Boy They Call Fish: Extraordinary People</strong><br />9pm, Channel 5</h2><p>Lamellar ichthyosis is a condition that gives sufferers a scaly, fishlike appearance. A terrible affliction on its own, but this story follows 18-year-old Vietnamese orphan Minh Anh, who also has learning difficulties. What little joy there is in his life comes courtesy of Brenda, an Essex retiree who has visited him since volunteering at his orphanage 15 years ago. Brenda worries that Minh Anh will be moved to an adult facility with no prospect of treatment. This film follows Brenda on a visit where she tries to ameliorate his situation. An extraordinary tale indeed. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>Simón Bolivar Orchestra – Live From Stirling</strong><br />9pm, BBC4</h2><p>Traditionally held up as an example of how youth leaders can turn around lives with the transformative power of classical music, the Simón Bolivar Orchestra of Venezuela perform a concert in Scotland as part of the London 2012 festival. It's a strange meeting of occasion and geography but this is likely to be another impressive showing from the maturing orchestra (technically, it's no longer a \"youth orchestra\"). The youth element here comes from Raploch's Big Noise project, a Scottish cousin of the original South American educational \"Sistema\". <em>JR</em></p><h2><strong>Playhouse Presents: Psychobitches</strong><br />9pm, Sky Arts 1</h2><h2><strong>Dead Boss</strong><br />10.30pm, BBC3</h2><p>If the second part of last week's double bill seemed slow, here's a cracker of an episode to drive the series along. Anna Crilly (Magda in Lead Balloon) steals the show as German cannibal Gertrude Wermers, who comes to the prison on an exchange programme, much to Top Dog's delight. In the office, there's more news about the mystery of the lottery syndicate, and Mr Bridge's widow makes her presence felt by removing the Nespresso machine. <em>Rebecca Nicholson</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 21/06/2012","trailText":"<p>The Men Who Made Us Fat | The Boy They Call Fish: Extraordinary People | Simón Bolivar Orchestra Live From Stirling | Playhouse Presents: Psychobitches</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/19/1340129888670/The-Men-Who-Made-Us-Fat-003.jpg","wordcount":"362","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"391869483","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6320224","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Wright, Julia Raeside, Hannah Verdier, Rebecca Nicholson","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1762159","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-23T19:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/20/men-who-made-us-fat","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/20/men-who-made-us-fat","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanwright","webTitle":"Jonathan Wright","rcsId":"GNL402347","r2ContributorId":"15911","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/11/1294776243384/Jonathan-Wright.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Wright is a writer on science fiction and television</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwright","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonathanwright","references":[]},{"id":"profile/juliaraeside","webTitle":"Julia Raeside","r2ContributorId":"26860","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Julia Raeside writes about television for the Guardian Guide and the G2 section of the paper and reviews films for <a href=\"http://www.filmfour.com\">filmfour.com</a>.

Her research focuses on two of her great-grandparents. Alexander Cunningham Ryan, Womack learns, was injured in the first world war. More unusually, euphonium theft and personal disgrace also featured in his life history. As for great-grandma Beatrice Garraud, she initially proves to be an elusive figure. Cue Womack, with much help from experts, turning detective as she tries to learn why her forebear, whose mother was still alive, lived in an orphanage. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>Celebrity Big Brother: Launch Show</strong><br />9pm, Channel 5</h2><p>Civilian Big Brother passed in a bland blur, so now it's time for the celebrity version. Brian Dowling whips the crowd into a frenzy in tonight's live launch show. Of course the definition of \"celebrity\" is as loose as ever – the show is open to anyone who has grabbed headlines for two minutes, or spoken to someone who did. Still, it's always more entertaining than standard Big Brother. Who's in?&nbsp;The lineup will be revealed tonight, but Samantha \"Hey, I'm beautiful\" Brick is among those rumoured. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2><strong>The Culture Show at the Edinburgh Festival Part 1</strong><br />10pm, BBC2</h2><p>Sue Perkins takes over presenting duties in this first of three shows from the Scottish arts festival. Guests include comedian Mark Thomas talking about his stand-up, Harry Hill showing off his art, and Miriam Margolyes, who checks out the Catherine the Great exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland. Plus there's sure to be a rolling conveyor belt of comics, musicians and performers to further liven things up. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>Death Camp Treblinka Survivor Stories</strong><br />9pm, BBC4</h2><p>The publicity for this documentary describes Treblinka as a \"forgotten death camp\", which might be pushing things, given that Holocaust studies is an ever-burgeoning concern and the Nazis are a staple of factual TV. Still, there is a remarkable story here of how Samuel Willenberg and Kalman Taigman escaped the killing facility in occupied Poland (responsible for the deaths of more than 800,000 Jews) during a revolt in 1943. One joined the ill-fated Warsaw uprising in 1944 as an act of vengeance, while the other appeared at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2>You Gotta Eat Here!<br />9pm, Good Food</h2><p>It can only be his hypermetabolic manner as a presenter that prevents John Catucci from tipping the scales at 40st. He's an enthusiastic junk-food connoisseur and in this new series visits the Canadian joints known for making the best high-calorie food in the business, from Stoney's Pizza parlour to the Rock Cod Cafe, from chocolate peanut butter cheesecake to slow-roasted lamb sandwiches, all served in heroic portions. Just watching this is liable to make you put on weight. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><h2><br />Celebrity Bedlam<br />10pm, E4</h2><p>Fresh from Sellotaping fruit to Big Brother contestants' faces, Lee Kern turns his attentions to the subject of travel and adventure in his celeb-pranking show. His innocent face and deadpan attitude serves him well as he preys on his unsuspecting victims. This week, Lee poses as the world's only blind racing driver, persuades hapless boybander Andy Scott-Lee to break the news that scientists have found the iceberg that hit the Titanic and convinces Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon that she's presenting a show to be shown on plasma screens in the South Pole. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 15/08/2012","trailText":"Who Do You Think You Are? | Celebrity Big Brother: Launch Show | The Culture Show at the Edinburgh Festival Part 1 | Death Camp Treblinka Survivor Stories | You Gotta Eat Here! | Celebrity Bedlam","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344953168684/Who-Do-You-Think-You-Are-003.jpg","wordcount":"554","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394706224","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6538343","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Wright, Hannah Verdier, Julia Raeside, Martin Skegg and David Stubbs","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1787628","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-17T19:00:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/14/who-do-you-think-you-are","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/14/who-do-you-think-you-are","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanwright","webTitle":"Jonathan Wright","rcsId":"GNL402347","r2ContributorId":"15911","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/11/1294776243384/Jonathan-Wright.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Wright is a writer on science fiction and television</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwright","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonathanwright","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hannah-verdier","webTitle":"Hannah Verdier","r2ContributorId":"47270","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-verdier","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/hannah-verdier","references":[]},{"id":"profile/juliaraeside","webTitle":"Julia Raeside","r2ContributorId":"26860","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Julia Raeside writes about television for the Guardian Guide and the G2 section of the paper and reviews films for <a href=\"http://www.filmfour.com\">filmfour.com</a>.

Blow The Inheritance | Nature's Microworlds | Our War | Revenge | The Riots: In Their Own Words | Toast Of London","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-06-04T04:00:51Z","body":"<h2>Don't Blow The Inheritance<br />5pm, ITV1<br /></h2><p>Punslinger Tim Vine presents this throwback of a quiz show (families; score boards; insultingly easy questions) – with a modern twist: this time, parents compete to win an \"inheritance\" (aka cash prize) for their over-18s, which they could still blow by the end of the show. Vine's gag-valanche is a matter of personal taste, but there's a couple of choice ones buried in there: \"Do you know, if you chop a horse in half and bang the ends together, it sounds like someone riding a coconut?\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><h2><strong>Nature's Microworlds</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC4</h2><p>The last in the compact surveys of the world's ecosystems examines Svalbard, which sits within the Arctic Circle. It's a special place, as it benefits from the last vestiges of the Gulf Stream; this creates a short summer that allows the frozen sea to melt and the ground to thaw. As a result, plants and animals pack a whole life cycle into a few weeks of opportunity. Relaying the complex interplay of life in just 30 minutes, the film is a punchy antidote to the sometimes bloated \"event\" nature documentary. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Our War</strong><br />9pm, BBC3</h2><p>From Ross Kemp's terrified excursions in the region to journalists embedded with serving personnel, the war in Afghanistan has not been short on quality documentary coverage. Our War, returning for a second series, attempts something that must have been a bureaucratic nightmare: the story of life serving in Helmand Province, in the words and photos of the soldiers who are serving there. This opening episode joins the Duke Of Lancaster's Regiment as they protect a vital road link. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2><strong>Revenge</strong><br />9pm, E4</h2><p>There are shows that tread a fine line where they have to string things out as long as possible while still throwing the viewer an occasional bone to keep them watching. Lost and The Killing were both magnificent at maintaining that balance, and now you can add Revenge to the list. In one of the show's finest episodes to date, Emily works up a typically complicated scheme to get the other Emily (Amanda, the real Emily) to skip town. It's a plan that has unexpected consequences and makes us wonder whether the person we're rooting for is worth our sympathy or is instead as callous as those she's after. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p><h2><strong>The Riots: In Their Own&nbsp;Words</strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2><p>\"I can remember the air crackling with static,\" says Sergeant Henry Beresford of the British Transport Police. But even the most grizzled copper could surely not have guessed how terrifying the next few hours would be in Croydon, with officers forced to break into a burning building to warn its residents to evacuate. For all the criticism that's been directed at Britain's police over their handling of last summer's riots, a documentary gathering officers' testimony reminds you that it was ordinary men and women who were called upon to hold the thin blue line. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2>Toast Of London<br />10pm, Channel 4</h2><p>Matt Berry, familiar to viewers of The IT Crowd, takes the lead in this comedy pilot, written by Arthur Mathews. Steven Toast is a 40-something actor trying to right himself after a few setbacks (recent divorce; a starring role in a play so controversial people attack him in the street). Even given his considerable talents, it's hard to see how he can get his career and his life back on track by auditioning for a TV producer who is currently in jail for Holocaust denial.

She also knocks up a mean farfalle, as she grew up following her Italian granny's recipes. If Chiappa and her enthusiasm for food aren't irresistible enough, she makes cooking fresh pasta from scratch look so simple you'll hang your head in shame at the thought of buying it from a supermarket. There's lasagne verde and a mouthwatering mozzarella and tomato sauce on the menu, and she also makes a pilgrimage to Bologna to pick up tips from the locals. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2><strong>Mission to Mars: a&nbsp;Horizon Special</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>In the leadup to the planned landing on Mars of Nasa's Curiosity rover on 6 August, Horizon is here to tell how incredible and difficult the project will be. It's almost as though the engineers wanted to get their excuses in first in case it all goes wrong. The statistics, though, are sobering: two-thirds of missions to Mars have ended in disaster. As you might guess, sending a delicate craft millions of miles across space into an unpredictable atmosphere is enormously complex. Curiosity's procedures have to work first time, or Nasa's $2.5bn investment could simply vanish. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Coming Up</strong><br />11.05pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>This year's Coming Up season continues in its bid to showcase the work of new writers and directors with Spoof or Die, a timely effort directed by Prasanna Puwanarajah, who also made a short film for the opening ceremony of&nbsp;the Olympics. It's the story of 16-year-old Craig, a&nbsp;Belfast boy with a keen interest in the city's political history, and his partner in truancy Nicky, who has just moved over from England. <em>Rebecca Nicholson</em></p><h2><strong>Nature's Microworlds</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>This week Nature's Microworlds looks at the Amazon rainforest, less a Microworld – as previous episodes on the Serengeti and the Galapagos Islands have explored – than its own functioning ecosystem. It makes its own weather, for God's sake. Faced with the impossibility of summing up such a place&nbsp;in 30 minutes, this week's programme is spoilt for choice in terms of bafflingly immense facts and&nbsp;impressive footage of oxbow lakes stuffed full of two-metre-long giant otters, some of the rainforest's most prolific predators. <em>Ben&nbsp;Arnold</em></p><p></p><h2>Revenge<br />9pm, E4<br /></h2><p>As Revenge progresses, its already tenuous relationship with reality lessens, and the show is the better for it. It's got to the stage now where it's like some high-camp, super-soap opera with conniving women running rings around clueless, effete men. There's even a semi-mystical Japanese CEO who sidelines as a revenge mentor for Amanda/Emily. In a world where so much episodic TV is predictable, who could honestly say they saw that coming? The increasingly psychotic Tyler steals the show this week, blackmailing and bitching his way to the top and then entertainingly flipping out when it goes a bit wrong for him. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p><p></p><h2>First Cut: Britain's Oldest Stand-Up<br />10pm, More4<br /></h2><p>Chelsea Pensioner Jack Woodward followed his father into the armed forces and, later, showbusiness, becoming a BBC warm-up man in peacetime. But his last gig, in a working men's club in the north, was in 1968. And now, aged 90, he says: \"My biggest problem with standup comedy is standing up.\" This touching little film follows Jack's progress as he prepares to open for Ed Byrne at the Hammersmith Apollo. Will he remember his lines? \"I've still got what it takes to get a lady into the bedroom. A stair lift.\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 30/07/2012","trailText":"Simply Italian | Mission to Mars: a Horizon Special | Coming Up | Nature's Microworlds | Revenge | First Cut: Britain's Oldest Stand-up","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/7/27/1343406053305/Michela-Chiappa-Simply-It-003.jpg","wordcount":"564","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"393710492","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6466472","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hannah Verdier, Martin Skegg, Rebecca Nicholson, Ben Arnold, Phelim O'Neill and Ali Catterall","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-07-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1779921","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-01T21:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/29/tv-highlights-simply-italian-mars","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/29/tv-highlights-simply-italian-mars","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hannah-verdier","webTitle":"Hannah Verdier","r2ContributorId":"47270","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-verdier","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/hannah-verdier","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-skegg","webTitle":"Martin Skegg","r2ContributorId":"33186","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-skegg","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/martin-skegg","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rebeccanicholson","webTitle":"Rebecca Nicholson","r2ContributorId":"27855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/2/3/1328266428631/Rebecca-Nicholson-003.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebeccanicholson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/rebeccanicholson","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-arnold","webTitle":"Ben Arnold","r2ContributorId":"45285","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-arnold","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-arnold","references":[]},{"id":"profile/phelimoneill","webTitle":"Phelim O'Neill","rcsId":"GNL385096","r2ContributorId":"15287","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phelimoneill","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/phelimoneill","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alicatterall","webTitle":"Ali Catterall","r2ContributorId":"25791","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ali Catterall is a staff writer for Film4.com and writes Movie Rush, Film4's movie reviews show.

Meanwhile, the ladies of the Hampshire WI get busy with the preserves. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2>Screenwriters – The Bafta And BFI Lectures<br />8pm, Sky Arts1</h2><p>The last in this series of masterclass lectures from prominent writers from film and TV may well be the best of the lot, featuring an insight into the inner workings of the inimitable Charlie Kaufman, the mind behind such knotty greats as Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Kaufman argues here that a production-line culture in Hollywood has stunted the creative output of many of his peers, and calls for a shift towards original screenwriters. Easier said than done, one fears, but a fine sentiment nonetheless. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><h2><strong>Good Cop</strong><br />9pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>This is a drama with the premise of a bad US cop movie, but which has been cast and played like the best kind of UK drama. Warren Brown continues to do a great job as John-Paul, a slightly anonymous-looking Liverpool policeman whose vigilante actions to avenge his murdered co-worker are beginning to give him a few worries. It's a tense drama, that finds John-Paul not so much losing the plot as pursuing tangential storylines – none of which are particularly well-advised. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2><strong>The Audience</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>On paper the concept for this new series is nuts. One person who faces a life-changing decision is literally followed around by 50 people for a week as they go about their lives. The audience observe, ask questions and meet people involved in the dilemma, before coming to a conclusion as to what should be done. As TV it works remarkably well, as people's different opinions are brought to bear, though the filmmakers are skilful in carving a narrative and know exactly what to do with the emotional capital generated. First up is dairy farmer Ian Wainwright, who must decide whether to stay at his family's farm or to start a new life. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>The InterCity 125: The&nbsp;Age Of The Train </strong><br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Perhaps best-known due to Jimmy Savile's long-running ad campaign, or for inspiring one of Ben \"Double Seat\" Elton's most memorable routines, the InterCity 125 was introduced by British Rail in 1976 with the aim of revitalising its commercial fortunes and to make travelling by train a more appealing experience for the public. Here we hear the story of how newly-installed BR bigwig Peter Parker set out to update Britain's rail industry, even if the tenacious telly cliche of old-fashioned compartment cars would live on for a while longer. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2>Stephen Hawking's Grand Design<br />9pm, Discovery</h2><p>\"Curving space and time may sound tricky to wrap your head around … but it's not.\" Effectively, here's where Stephen Hawking gets down with the kids. Or at least, tones it down to the point where phrases like \"Check it out!\" and \"Quantum physics – I told you it was weird!\" become commonplace. It's unnerving initially, but at least underlines the fact that this science gubbins is supposed to be fun. In this first episode, Hawking covers everything from gravity to the finely named luminiferous aether, while asking \"What is this universe stuff anyway?\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 13/09/2012","trailText":"Wartime Farm | Screenwriters – The Bafta And BFI Lectures | Good Cop | The Audience | The InterCity 125: The&nbsp;Age Of The Train | Stephen Hawking's Grand Design","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347454358024/Wartime-Farm-tractor-003.jpg","wordcount":"588","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"396039483","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6654585","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hannah Verdier, Gwilym Mumford, John Robinson, Martin Skegg, Mark Jones and Ali Catterall","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-09-13T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1800303","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-09-15T19:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/12/wartime-farm-good-cop","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/12/wartime-farm-good-cop","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp;

Some 26 years later he's still driving it, so as presenters go he's less Clarkson and more Tiff Needell. In a reverent look at the history of British motoring, McGann discovers some of the less-known pioneers of speed in Britain. Made up of assorted egotists and a handful of borderline maniacs, this reckless bunch risk life and limb for what Aldous Huxley called \"the one genuinely modern pleasure\". <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2><strong>MasterChef</strong><br />9pm, BBC1</h2><p>After winnowing out 21 hopefuls and taking in some truly stomach-churning cuisine – cockroaches in fish sauce, anyone? – Messrs Torode and Wallace are finally ready to determine the winner of MasterChef 2012. In comparison with some of the fiendish tasks of previous rounds, this assignment is relatively straightforward, with the three finalists preparing a three-course meal for their hosts. That said, macaroni and cheese simply won't cut it tonight. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><h2><strong>Love Life</strong><br />9pm, ITV1<br /></h2><p>When Lucy (Andrea Lowe) starts getting serious with Joe (Rob James-Collier) it precipitates his dash to the Himalayas; and when he returns, a year later, everything's changed. Lucy's now got a pronounced baby bulge and won't tell Joe who the father is – but can a rekindled romance be on the cards? Not so terrible, as these things go, although the leads are rather outshone by the supporting players, Alexander Armstrong and the peerless Gregor Fisher. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><h2><strong>Mary's Bottom Line</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Mary Portas disapproves of cheap, foreign-made clothes, so she's bringing manufacturing back to Britain. In Middleton, a textile mill graveyard town near Manchester, she reclaims a derelict factory and gets it working again. Her eight apprentices will be making knickers. Portas's good intentions are horribly thwarted by the style of programme-making, in particular the interview she has with a potential apprentice is excruciating as she talks about his \"tragic\" life on the dole while he just sits there and she tries to muster anything other than pity. She can't. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>The Hidden Art Of Islam</strong><br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Rageh Omaar visits the British Museum's current exhibition on the Hajj – the pilgrimage to Mecca that every observant Muslim is supposed to make at least once. Islamic art has been circumscribed to varying degrees by the fluctuating rigour with which Islamic laws have been interpreted: there have been periods in which everyone was more relaxed about representations of the prophet Mohammed than they presently are. Despite this unpredictable hazard, Islam has a rich tradition of figurative art, to which Omaar is a thoughtful guide. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Eastbound &amp; Down</strong><br />10pm, FX</h2><p>This season, unreconstructed jock and former baseball star Kenny Powers (Danny McBride) has relocated to Myrtle Beach. Here, he's pitching in the minor leagues, engaging in locker-room chat with likeminded buddy Shane to the bemusement of younger teammates, as well as banging college girls and trying to surf. The appeal of Eastbound is apparently in Powers's unapologetic espousal of pre-metrosexual, pre-PC, pre-latterday temperance-era attitudes; you just feel he gets cut a little too much slack by the supporting characters. <em>David Stubbs</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 15/03/2012","trailText":"Petrol Age | MasterChef | Love Life | Mary's Bottom Line | The Hidden Art Of Islam | Eastbound &amp; Down","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/3/14/1331730288136/Gregg-Wallace-and-John-To-003.jpg","wordcount":"517","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"387320894","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5935980","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ben Arnold, Gwilym Mumford, Ali Catterall, Julia Raeside, Andrew Mueller and David Stubbs","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1717642","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-17T19:59:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/14/masterchef-marys-bottom-line","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/14/masterchef-marys-bottom-line","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-arnold","webTitle":"Ben Arnold","r2ContributorId":"45285","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-arnold","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-arnold","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gwilym-mumford","webTitle":"Gwilym Mumford","r2ContributorId":"47264","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390492385593/Gwilym-Mumford-003.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/gwilym-mumford","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alicatterall","webTitle":"Ali Catterall","r2ContributorId":"25791","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ali Catterall is a staff writer for Film4.com and writes Movie Rush, Film4's movie reviews show.

Coren's aboard the train to explain how the coming of the railways to Scotland meant hitherto local delicacies could get to market further south. This foodie version of Coast concludes with tales of venison, salmon and the humble spud. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>Queen Victoria's Last&nbsp;Love</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Victoria's lengthy widowhood was relieved by relationships with charismatic males in her service, most famously John Brown. However, in her old age Victoria became smitten by a young Indian servant, Abdul Karim, whose tales of the subcontinent so charmed her that she promoted him to be her \"munshi\" or teacher. Their relationship horrified her court: for a member of the lower races to enjoy parity with them was unthinkable in the 19th century. As this drama-documentary shows, a confrontation ensued before the Diamond Jubilee. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><h2><strong>Beautiful Minds</strong><br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Professor Richard Dawkins is the most influential evolutionary biologist of his generation but is as well known these days for his outspoken attacks on religion. Here, he talks about his childhood in Africa and how his first encounters with Darwin's work initially left him underwhelmed, his scientific influences, and his campaigning days at Berkeley. It's all a lead up to his seminal work, The Selfish Gene, which turned evolutionary theory on its head and made him into a science superstar, but also flamed a controversy that's followed him ever since. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>Justified</strong><br />9pm, 5USA<br /></h2><p>This show has perhaps television's finest rogues' gallery, from nightmarish stone-cold killers down to comical (but dangerous) buffoons. Tonight we get them all. Hapless stooge Dewey Crowe loses something close to his heart, while Dickie Bennett is not happy with his depleted \"inheritance\". Meanwhile, an understaffed Boyd faces off to city slicker Quarles and there are signs that Devil is getting far too ambitious. That's a lot of crime for one small county. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p><h2>Mountain Of Ice<br />9pm, PBS<br /></h2><p>The Vinson Massif is well-named. It's the highest mountain in Antarctica, and this documentary records the first attempt to ascend it from its eastern side, with the climb team lugging a less-experienced film crew and an unspeakable amount of scientific kit along with them. Although this expedition took place in summer 2001, the beauty and hazards of the terrain haven't dated. Along the way, the team dispense their views on previous expeditions: claiming, for example, that Scott's disastrous polar expedition of 1912 failed entirely due to the leader's hubris. Spectacular, and informative too. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2>Turtle Boy: A BodyShock Special<br />10pm, Channel 4</h2><p>Six-year-old Didier lives in a hamlet in Columbia. He and his family are forced to live in isolation due to an extremely rare condition called congenital melanocytic nevus. This caused a mole to grow on his body to the extent that it covered 40% him; it looked like a shell, earning him the nickname Turtle Boy (the superstitious villagers blamed his mother for conceiving him during an eclipse). This documentary follows Didier as he prepares for an operation which, though risky, may give him the chance of a normal life. <em>MS</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 25/04/2012","trailText":"<p>Our Food | Queen Victoria's Last&nbsp;Love | Beautiful Minds | Justified | Mountains Of Ice | Turtle Boy: A Bodyshock Special</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/4/24/1335266839495/Victoria-And-Albert-Queen-003.jpg","wordcount":"538","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"389095086","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6092459","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Wright, David Stubbs, Martin Skegg, Phelim O'Neill and John Robinson","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-04-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1735289","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-04-27T19:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/24/queen-victorias-lastlove","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/24/queen-victorias-lastlove","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanwright","webTitle":"Jonathan Wright","rcsId":"GNL402347","r2ContributorId":"15911","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/11/1294776243384/Jonathan-Wright.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Wright is a writer on science fiction and television</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwright","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonathanwright","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidstubbs","webTitle":"David Stubbs","r2ContributorId":"26219","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Stubbs joined the music magazine Melody Maker in 1986, where he worked for 12 years writing, among other things, the Talk Talk Talk parody section.

Reporter Jenny Kleeman meets the Afghani director-actor who gets to boss real soldiers around on her shoot. She also meets a Taliban fighter who argues that cinema is against sharia law and that film-makers should and will be punished with death. With the widespread feeling that the Taliban could be back in power once coalition forces leave, many in the industry are defiant – but also fearful.  <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01glxm0\" title=\"\"><strong>Lip Service</strong></a><br />9pm, BBC3<br /></h2><p>It's Cat's birthday, and while Sam is planning a perfect day for her, she is more interested in writhing around in a corset in Frankie's bed. Tess is having a headache at&nbsp;work with diva Nora determined to undermine her acting talents, but she is happy to find that straight-talking doctor Lexy is single as she moves into her flat. Frankie sets off on a road trip with Sadie to photograph a boutique hotel. But all these saucy shenanigans are soon to be upstaged by  a tragic accident.  <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/very-important-people\" title=\"\"><strong>Very Important People</strong></a><br />9.30pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>In the 70s, audiences laughed in appreciative recognition as Mike Yarwood impersonated a range of public characters, even including trade union leaders. With latterday cultural fragmentation and the thin spread of increasingly nondescript \"celebrities\", the job of an impressions show such as this, starring Morgana Robinson and Terry Mynott, becomes all the harder. It is telling that they often have to announce who it is they're doing. Still, this is as capable as could be expected; in the first episode, Bear Grylls tries out his survival skills in the suburbs, while David Attenborough studies at close hand the remarkable animal that is Frankie Boyle. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Dexter<br />10pm, FX<br /></h2><p>It seems we can all go home early as <a href=\"http://fxuk.com/shows/dexter/about\" title=\"\">Dexter</a> has apparently solved this season's murder mystery. Seeing Travis returning to the scene of his latest crime, Dexter spots the proud look of a fellow serial killer easily enough. But we know more about these Doomsday Killers than Dexter does, and it looks as if the audience is going to be several steps ahead for some time. This isn't great for the show; Dexter, for all his faults, has always been the smartest person in play. Now we have to watch him slowly catch up with the viewers. Painful. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Alan Carr: Chatty Man</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Tulisa Contostavlos, from The X Factor and the now-defunct R&amp;B triumvirate N-Dubz, is among Alan Carr's guests for the return of Chatty Man, now entering its eighth series for Channel 4. Since her last appearance, a grubby MPEG of her has been distributed on the internet. Will Carr confront the grainy, pixelated elephant in the room? His chatty credentials hang in the balance. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><p></p><h2>30 Rock<br />10.30pm, Comedy Central</h2><p>Six series in, <a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/30-rock-season-06/episodes/30-rock-season-6-episode-05/video/a-jack-off-30-rock-605-759280/\" title=\"\">30 Rock</a> is still among the smartest sitcoms out there, its fast-cut style bearing comparison with animated comedy such as The Simpsons and Family Guy. Tonight, Liz decides to settle a contract dispute with Jack by using an old tape of his own negotiating techniques. Meanwhile, Tracy and Jenna help out a shy barmitzvah boy whose only experience of girls is \"a Japanese videogame where you slap prostitutes to death\", and Kenneth the page is feeling unwanted, though as Jack observes, he needn't be too downhearted – \"He's a white male with hair – the sky's the limit!\" <em>DS</em></p>","headline":"TV highlights 27/04/2012","trailText":"Unreported World | Lip Service | Very Important People | Dexter | Alan Carr: Chatty Man | 30 Rock","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/26/1335440953772/Unreported-World-003.jpg","wordcount":"562","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"389263780","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6103560","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Skegg, Hannah Verdier, David Stubbs, Phelim O'Neill and Ben Arnold","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-04-27T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1736801","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-04-29T18:30:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/26/unreported-world-lip-service-vip","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/26/unreported-world-lip-service-vip","tags":[{"id":"culture/series/watchthis","webTitle":"Watch this","type":"series","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/series/watchthis","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/tvandradio","webTitle":"TV and radio in G2","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/tvandradio","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-skegg","webTitle":"Martin Skegg","r2ContributorId":"33186","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-skegg","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/martin-skegg","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hannah-verdier","webTitle":"Hannah Verdier","r2ContributorId":"47270","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-verdier","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/hannah-verdier","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidstubbs","webTitle":"David Stubbs","r2ContributorId":"26219","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Stubbs joined the music magazine Melody Maker in 1986, where he worked for 12 years writing, among other things, the Talk Talk Talk parody section.
