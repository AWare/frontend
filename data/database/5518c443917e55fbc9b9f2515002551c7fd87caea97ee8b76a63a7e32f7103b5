You will receive a painful brand of “F” for Flawed and be forced to live life as a second class citizen, a situation enforced by a powerful but respected Guild. </p> <p>This is the world that Celestine lives in. Her boyfriend is the son of Judge Crevan, the head of the Guild with the power to decide whether someone is Flawed or not. She strives for perfection every day but one decision may bring her life crashing down. </p> <p> <br />We all know Cecelia Ahern can write; you don’t sell millions of books and have your novels turned into films without being extremely talented. What I was unsure of, however, was how she would cope with a change in audience and a pretty ambitious concept. It soon became clear that Flawed is one of the best written dystopian novels around. <br /> <br />When writing anything with a complex plot, there are so many holes you can fall into. If one book has an amazing and fully-formed concept, it probably lacks a little bit in character development and vice versa. However, Cecelia’s experience writing many novels means Flawed is close to flawless! There isn’t a single aspect of this novel that feels weak and that really sets it out from the masses of YA fiction flooding onto shelves at the moment. <br /> <br />Although the concept of being ostracised from society is common in YA, what sets Flawed apart is the particular emphasis on Celeste’s emotional journey, dealing with the awful consequences of being publically shunned; this makes it seem all the more real and powerful. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec/0_0_248_400/248.jpg\" alt=\"Flawed\" width=\"248\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>From start to finish, Flawed grips you and holds you there right until the end, at which point I was desperate for the story to continue. I’m so glad that there is a sequel on the way as I’d love to find out how Celeste and Carrick’s stories play out. Pick up Flawed if you’re a fan of awesome YA dystopia or just if you appreciate really well written fiction.</p> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/292873/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>awkward unicorn:</strong> ‘Flawed is one of the best written dystopian novels around’","headline":"Flawed by Cecelia Ahern - review","byline":"awkward unicorn"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/mar/16/flawed-cecelia-ahern-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2016/mar/16/flawed-cecelia-ahern-review","sectionName":"Children's books","elements":[{"id":"b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec","relation":"body","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec/0_0_248_400/248.jpg","typeData":{"role":"thumbnail","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec","altText":"Flawed","source":"PR","credit":"Photograph: PR","mediaId":"b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec","displayCredit":"false","imageType":"Photograph","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec/0_0_248_400/248.jpg","width":"248","height":"400"},"mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec/0_0_248_400/master/248.jpg","typeData":{"role":"thumbnail","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec","altText":"Flawed","source":"PR","credit":"Photograph: PR","mediaId":"b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec","displayCredit":"false","imageType":"Photograph","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e1a02d4f4a96a89d832142becb377e5a3483ec/0_0_248_400/master/248.jpg","width":"248","height":"400","isMaster":"true"},"mimeType":"image/jpeg"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webTitle":"Children's books","type":"blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionId":"books","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-books","sectionId":"books","webTitle":"Teen books","type":"keyword","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","sectionId":"books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","sectionId":"culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/dystopian-fiction","sectionId":"books","webTitle":"Dystopian fiction (children and teens)","type":"keyword","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dystopian-fiction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/dystopian-fiction","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/childrens-user-reviews","webTitle":"Children's user reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","references":[]}],"references":[]},{"webPublicationDate":"2016-03-16T08:30:15Z","webTitle":"The Arabian Nights: the last set of fairytales that just might have a chance of being real","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","type":"article","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"id":"childrens-books-site/2016/mar/16/arabian-nights-thousand-and-one-nights-alwyn-hamilton","fields":{"byline":"Alwyn Hamilton","headline":"The Arabian Nights: the last set of fairytales that just might have a chance of being real","trailText":"Alwyn Hamilton realised as a young girl that Rapunzel and Cinderella weren’t real.

In fact I don’t think we ever even ventured beyond the French Borders unless Napoleon did. For me as a child that meant the near east held a mysterious draw that comes with a lack of actual knowledge, and let my imagination run wild until everything I read in storybooks seemed like it really might be out there in the desert. I imagine this might be like what it was like to hear fairy stories before the world was so thoroughly explored, and you could believe that somewhere beyond the edge of the map you knew there really was a kingdom where girls had hair with the tensile strength to support a lovesick Prince’s weight up the tower. The Arabian Nights were stories about rulers I had never heard of, from countries I probably wouldn’t be able to point at on a map, and which I was therefore free to imagine really did resemble the ones in the pages of the storybook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61cec84d6abb83f7aa7a0d478c5471e586150ac1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/61cec84d6abb83f7aa7a0d478c5471e586150ac1/0_0_2448_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ARabian Nights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A magical journey, at night - from Alwyn’s copy of the Arabian Nights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alwyn Hamilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The western fascination with the Thousand And One Nights isn’t a unique phenomenon to one day-dreaming child. In 1704 Antoine Galland started translating and adapting the text into French, the first Western collection of these stories, and it launched a fashion for Orientalism in Europe, which lasted well into the late nineteenth century. In 1721, Montesquieu published Les Lettres Persanes (The Persian Letters), Voltaire’s 1758 work Candide makes reference to the Thousand And One Nights, and in 1782 Mozart premiered his Opera Abduction from the Seraglio. And then there’s the paintings: Ingres painted Turkish Baths while Delacroix sketched street scenes in Morocco. It’s not by any means all down to the tales of Sultans and Genies. For one, the aforementioned Napoleonic tendencies towards conquest in Egypt played a huge part, but for me there always seemed to be a thread running through that tied it all together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fe7e1e73add0243099554f8202188b4c5a155ef\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2fe7e1e73add0243099554f8202188b4c5a155ef/0_598_2683_1610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alwyn Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alwyn Hamilton: The western fascination with the Thousand And One Nights isn’t a unique phenomenon to one day-dreaming child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a modern, and grown up, point of view there’s serious room to side eye this trend as a fetishization and simplification of several other cultures, amalgamating them all into one nebulous “orient”. But it meant that the Thousand And One Nights was imprinted in such a way that it stuck as part of culture that I grew up in, always viewed through a slightly hazy romanticized lens. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/dec/08/rama-sarwat-chadda-rama-indian-hero-ramayana-hindu\">My inspiration: Sarwat Chadda on Indian hero, Rama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a child I read a beautifully illustrated junior edition of the Arabian Nights, which was made more PG-13, without turning it cartoonish, and first experienced the Inception-like nature of the stories, in which Scheherazade’s tales feature Fishermen who save themselves from Genies by using astonishing stories of kings, who in turn have a history to recount. In philosophy, when talking about the nature of perception and reality, we discussed the story of the Sultan who cruelly tricked a beggar into thinking he had woken up as a king, and then again into thinking it was all a dream. And then I went on to study History of Art with a focus on eighteenth and nineteenth-century French painting, which led to standing in front of the larger-than-life Delacroix, La Mort de Sardanapale in the Louvre – not an Arabian Nights tale but another romanticized eastern story. The Thousand And One Nights always skirted at the edge of my consciousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daf13d371ff61dc29c42cfd5ca855b3b5fc63acf\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/daf13d371ff61dc29c42cfd5ca855b3b5fc63acf/0_0_2448_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fdd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cut to me being more than old enough to know nothing would come from rubbing a lamp. I was toying with an idea about an Annie Oakley-type sharpshooter girl who went by The Blue Eyed Bandit in a harsh desert town. Except I had no interest in actually writing a western. I was firmly committed to making it magical. I’m not sure whether it was the desert that did it, or the fact that “bandit” conjured up memories of Ali Baba and his 40 thieves, but when thinking about turning this world from mundane to magical, it was the Thousand And One Nights that came to mind. And so the idea became Rebel of the Sands, a story imbued with the last set of fairytales I believed just might have a chance of being real, long after I knew scullery maids didn’t become queen of france.</p> <h2>Rebel of the Sands is this month’s Teen book club read.

Where did he come from and what makes him tick?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The hype about the information age has been going on for so long that you’d assume all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\" title=\"\">Silicon Valley</a> innovation these days is based on apps and the internet, rather than sophisticated physical engineering: bits, not atoms. It has got to the stage where many tech startups look like parodic solutions in search of problems, as with the dozens of companies hoping to become the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\" title=\"\">Uber</a> for laundry. Yet the most intriguing figure among the Valley’s billionaire entrepreneurs right now makes incredibly elaborate machines: electric cars and space rockets. While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wants to change the world by enabling you to see more baby photos, the man who glories in the sci-fi name of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\" title=\"\">Elon Musk</a> wants to change the world by solving transport and global warming, and establishing a colony on Mars. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdowneyjr\" title=\"\">Robert Downey Jr</a> took inspiration from a visit to Musk’s rocket factory for his portrayal of <em>Iron Man</em>’s Tony Stark. “My mind is not easily blown,” Downey Jr reported, “but this place and this guy were amazing.” Musk has also been a guest star on <em>The Simpsons</em>. So who exactly is he, and can he be serious?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/may/25/elon-musk-entrepreneur-observer-profile\">Elon Musk: the new It Boy of Silicon Valley | The Observer profile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971. His troubled father made his childhood “a kind of misery”, but he was also free to experiment with building home-made rockets in the company of his cousins. At the age of 12 he published in a magazine the code for a video game he had written. He moved to Canada at 17 and worked odd manual jobs before winding up at the University of Pennsylvania, where he took degrees in both physics and economics. Soon afterwards Musk co‑founded an early internet-mapping company called Zip2, and when Compaq bought it in 1999 he made $22m (£15m). He ploughed most of it into his next venture, an internet-banking startup that would become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/paypal\" title=\"\">PayPal</a>. In Ashlee Vance’s fascinating and superbly researched biography, one Musk admirer describes this decision as representing “an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.” In a bus shelter, that is, with the $4m Musk had reserved for his personal use. Some Valley people do rather lack perspective. When PayPal in turn was eventually bought by eBay in 2002, Musk found himself with more than $100m at his disposal.</p> <p>Time to retire? Not a bit of it. Musk pumped nearly all of this money into the two ventures for which he is known today: the electric-car company Tesla Motors (Musk was an early investor and board chairman before becoming CEO), and the rocket company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/22/welcome-back-baby-elon-musk-celebrates-spacex-rocket-launch-and-landing\" title=\"\">SpaceX</a>. (He also has a solar-panel company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-firm-blames-subsidy-cuts-for-uk-exit\" title=\"\">SolarCity</a>.) These business decisions were thrillingly contrary to the prevailing wisdom of bits over atoms. Tesla was based in Silicon Valley, and SpaceX opened its factory in the middle of Los Angeles, where tattooed engineers worked on rocket engines to a deafening soundtrack of Van Halen. As Vance describes it, Musk “doubled down on making super-complex physical goods in two of the most expensive places in the world”.</p> <p>For years, however, both companies were near-jokes, and people were waiting to see Musk fail. Tesla was late delivering its first electric supercars to celebrity customers, while SpaceX’s test rockets kept blowing up. But Musk persevered. Tesla now sells nearly 50,000 cars a year. And SpaceX became the first private company in history to launch a rocket into orbit; in 2013 it successfully delivered its first commercial satellite. It now has a long and profitable roster of launch missions planned for government agencies, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\" title=\"\">Nasa</a> (to resupply the International Space Station), and satellite companies. No one is laughing any more. As Musk’s former eBay comrade Peter Thiel tells Vance: “To the extent that the world still doubts Elon, I think it’s a reflection on the insanity of the world and not on the supposed insanity of Elon.”</p> <p>Musk is, everyone says, a genius, able to solve complex orbital equations in his head and successfully perform the job of any given engineer in his companies. (Friends affectionately report his habit of falling silent and thinking about rocket problems.) Like many modern geek entrepreneurs – most notoriously the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs\" title=\"\">Steve Jobs</a> – he also has an abrasive management style, sometimes insulting brilliant colleagues and firing people without warning. Vance makes a valiant attempt to explain: “He sees man as self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in the way of all this [...] he feels pained by their mistakes, which have consigned man to peril that much longer.”</p> <p>Yet Musk also seems much more like a regular human being than many other tech CEOs. One investor calls him “nicer than Jobs and a bit more refined than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/billgates\" title=\"\">Bill Gates</a>”. He is interested in more than just tech: he follows the New York Review of Books on Twitter, where his profile gives his location, in an accurate joke, as “1 AU”. (An astronomical unit is defined as the average distance between the sun and Earth.) He shares custody of his five sons with his former wife, Justine Musk. (He subsequently married, divorced and remarried the British actor Talulah Riley.) Though evidently immensely driven, Musk can be self-mocking and surprisingly funny. “No man is an island,” he likes to say, “unless he is large and buoyant.” And he tells the story of contracting a dangerous bout of malaria while on holiday: “That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.”</p> <p>Meanwhile he is engagingly rude about some of his peers, particularly the founder and CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. “I do think Bezos has an insatiable desire to be King Bezos,” Musk tells Vance. “He has a relentless work ethic and wants to kill everything in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/30/future-of-e-commerce-bricks-and-mortar\" title=\"\">e-commerce</a>. But he’s not the most fun guy, honestly.” Bezos has funnelled some of his own vast fortune into a rival space company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/08/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-humans-in-space\" title=\"\">Blue Origin</a>. Forget yachts: spaceships are the new trophy craft of the super-rich. But as Vance points out, Musk had to build SpaceX from the ground up as a real commercial outfit.</p> <p>Musk didn’t invent the rocket, nor the electric car. But he did, with his fellow engineers, reinvent them. Most crucially, he made them good enough, cheaply enough. Teslas are the first electric cars to solve “range anxiety”: the company’s battery-pack tech gives its cars 200 to 300 miles between charges. (Electric cars, of course, don’t solve the climate problem by themselves: the electricity you charge them with still has to be generated somehow. Ideally, for a Musk lifestyle addict, it will be generated by your home installation of SolarCity panels. In any case, getting machines that burn fossil fuels off the streets is an important step.) The most crucial innovation SpaceX made in rocket design, meanwhile, was the audacious decision to build nearly everything itself. Insourcing became the new outsourcing. By designing and constructing almost all the parts from engines to electronics, SpaceX could shave chunks off the prices demanded by external suppliers, while being able to iterate and change things in the designs very quickly when needed.</p> <p>Today the word “philanthropy”, which means love of mankind, is reserved to describe the actions of rich people who receive tax breaks for donating money to art galleries or carefully chosen charities. The term implies that only those who have acquired lots of wealth and then disgorge it to carefully selected institutions can truly love their fellow humans. Among giants of the tech industry it is more accurately applied, at least, to someone like Gates, whose foundation is attacking problems of the global poor such as malaria. But philanthropy can take more forms still. A medical researcher, or even a novelist, might be philanthropic in her motivations. And so too, by all accounts, is Musk.</p> <p>Musk’s philanthropy, though, does not consist in giving his billions away, but in trying to make his businesses succeed in order to save humanity from civilisational collapse or planetary extinction. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/20/nasa-signs-contracts-spacex-manned-commercial-spaceflight\" title=\"\">Gwynne Shotwell</a>, SpaceX’s president and COO, describes the company’s mission: “If you hate people and think human extinction is okay, then fuck it. Don’t go to space. If you think it is worth humans doing some risk management and finding a second place to go live, then you should be focused on this issue and willing to spend some money.”</p> <p>Perhaps it will all crash and burn. But Musk certainly can’t be accused of lowering his sights, or shirking what he conceives of as his responsibility. As he says to Vance about another side‑project: “I think this needs to be done, and I don’t see anyone else doing it.” Future generations might be glad he did.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hh8d","wordcount":"1517","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8e996f6890794be2dd51ce51fb440c066ca2fb34/0_196_3500_2102/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-29T15:18:00Z","standfirst":"The Silicon Valley entrepreneur wants to solve humanity’s problems with his electric cars, space travel and solar panels.

Их звали Андрей Луговой и Дмитрий Ковтун. Они прилетели из Москвы тем же утром, провезя под носом у британской таможни не наркотики и не крупную сумму денег, а некое таинственное вещество — причем в такой форме в Великобритании с ним никому не доводилось сталкиваться. <br /></p> <p>Веществом был высокотоксичный изотоп полония. Пожалуй, это самый сильный из известных сегодня ядов — в 100 миллиардов раз мощнее синильной кислоты. Полоний был получен из ядерного реактора в России. С его помощью Луговой и Ковтун должны были отравить Александра Литвиненко, агента МИ-6 и последовательного критика Кремля. Никаких личных мотивов у убийц не было: они действовали по заданию ФСБ в рамках операции, которую, скорее всего, лично санкционировал президент России Владимир Путин.</p> <p>Скотленд-Ярду так и не удалось установить, каким образом убийцы смогли провезти полоний в Великобританию. Количество вещества было очень небольшим, так что спрятать его было нетрудно. Есть несколько возможных вариантов — полоний мог находиться в лекарственной бутылочке с крышкой-пипеткой; в пузырьке в виде аэрозоля; можно было даже поместить его в контейнер, спрятанный внутри перьевой ручки. Внутри контейнера полоний не представляет опасности, но стоит вдохнуть его — и ты труп.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79c3b571fb95b894302943e7eb45ae8bd92185b5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/79c3b571fb95b894302943e7eb45ae8bd92185b5/0_184_1591_1487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former spy, Alexander Litvinenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"935\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Александр Литвиненко.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alistair Fuller/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Как выяснилось впоследствии, ни Луговой, ни Ковтун не знали, что именно они везли. Иначе их поведение в Великобритании можно было бы счесть не просто маразматическим, но даже самоубийственным. Судя по всему, никто не рассказал им ни о токсичных свойствах полония-210, ни о том, что вещество оставляет след, по которому переносчиков можно вычислить — с точностью до того, на каких стульях они сидели. Анализ радиоактивного альфа-излучения позволил установить каждый предмет, до которого дотрагивались убийцы.</p> <p>Тем утром в 11 часов 39 минут Луговой позвонил Литвиненко из аэропорта Гэтвик и договорился о встрече в офисе компании Erinys на Гросвенор-стрит. Литвиненко был уверен, что это будет обычная деловая встреча — Луговой предлагал ему свои услуги в качестве партнера в консалтинговой фирме.</p> <p>До центра Лондона убийцы добрались на поезде. Они сняли номер в отеле Best Western на Шэфтсбери-авеню, в самом центре Сохо. Первое правило шпионажа — не привлекать к себе внимание. Однако Луговой и Ковтун выглядели не просто как шпионы — они выглядели как карикатурные злодеи из фильма про КГБ. Переодевшись в «деловые костюмы», они предстали перед персоналом отеля примерно в таком виде: на Ковтуне был серебристый синтетический костюм, на Луговом — костюм в клетку, на каждом — цветные рубашки и галстуки и увесистые ювелирные изделия. Как рассказал менеджер отеля Горан Крго, больше всего они смахивали на типичных бандитов из Восточной Европы: «Цвета не сочетались, костюмы сидели плохо — видно было, что носить их они не умеют. Кажется, про такое говорят — как ослу седло». </p> <p>В три часа дня Литвиненко встретился с Луговым и Ковтуном на Гросвенор-стрит. С ними также был Тим Райли, глава компании Erinys. Он пожал гостям руки и провел их в переговорную.</p> <p>Встреча началась, как это принято в Англии, с разговора о погоде. Затем Луговой свел беседу к чаю — и предложил устроить чаепитие, ведь англичане все время пьют чай. Райли отказался, заявив, что только что выпил воды из кулера, однако Луговой почему-то продолжал настаивать. «Они все время повторяли: неужто вы не хотите [чаю], неужели не выпьете?» — вспоминал Райли. </p> <p>В итоге Райли предложил посетителям чай и сел справа от Литвиненко. Сам Литвиненко сидел во главе стола, спиной к эркеру. Напротив Райли сидел Луговой, а Ковтун — слева от него. Подав чай, Райли — к радости будущих убийц — отлучился в туалет.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5753ad678750a603405ad18c15df6fe4500f15a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b5753ad678750a603405ad18c15df6fe4500f15a/0_0_2173_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo issued by the Litvinenko inquiry of the teapot used to poison Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko found to contain traces of polonium 210.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Чайник, с помощью которого был отравлен Александр Литвиненко. На чайнике были обнаружены следы полония-210.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Litvinenko Inquiry/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Мы до сих пор не знаем, как именно был применен полоний. Данные криминалистической экспертизы свидетельствуют, что-либо Луговой, либо Ковтун подмешали вещество в чай Литвиненко. В течение следующего получаса чашка с чаем стояла перед ним, как невидимая атомная бомба с часовым механизмом. Вероятно, Ковтун и Луговой не особенно следили за разговором. Главным вопросом для них было — выпьет ли Литвиненко чай?</p> <p>Литвиненко чай не выпил. Можно только догадываться, о чем думали Луговой и Ковтун, когда встреча закончилась, а он так и не притронулся к чашке.</p> <p>Когда переговорную комнату Erinys обследовали ученые-ядерщики, они пришли к выводу, что стол буквально распирает от радиоактивного заражения. Очевидно, имела место значительная утечка. Тим Райли даже переживал, не был ли и он мишенью убийц. На одном участке стола, непосредственно там, где сидел Литвиненко, счетчик альфа-излучений показал больше 10 тысяч импульсов в секунду. Этот участок признали местом «первичного заражения» — это значит, что источником радиации мог быть только сам полоний. На других участках стола счетчик показывал около 2300 импульсов в секунду; на одном из стульев (где сидел либо Луговой, либо Ковтун) было зафиксировано 7000 импульсов в секунду.</p> <p>Русские впоследствии говорили, что это Литвиненко пытался их отравить. Якобы он подмешал им полоний, когда встретил их в тот день в районе Мэйфэр (<em>Гросвенор-стрит — одна из центральных улиц этого района — прим. «Медузы»</em>). Этим, по их словам, объясняются все обнаруженные впоследствии следы вещества. Российские государственные СМИ поддержали эту версию как истинную.</p> <p>Но Скотленд-Ярд, проследив маршрут Литвиненко от дома, без труда отмел эту версию. Изучив данные электронного проездного Литвиненко, полицейские нашли автобус, на котором тот ехал на встречу (номер LR02 BCX). Обследование автобуса не выявило признаков радиоактивного заражения.</p> <p>А вот за Луговым и Ковтуном повсюду тянулся радиоактивный след — в том числе, признаки заражения были выявлены в гостиничных номерах, куда они заселились до встречи с Литвиненко. После встречи Литвиненко повел их в свой любимый ресторан (суши-бар Itsu на площади Пикадилли). Там тоже обнаружили следы полония.</p> <p>Впоследствии Луговой рассказывал, что, оставив Литвиненко в ресторане, они с Ковтуном полтора часа гуляли по Сохо. В частности, они заглянули в бар Dar Marrakesh в развлекательном комплексе «Трокадеро», где Луговой выкурил кальян (что обошлось ему в девять фунтов стерлингов). Найти этот кальян не составило для полиции труда — от него исходило радиоактивное свечение.</p> <p>Литвиненко, вернувшись домой, почувствовал себя неважно. Один раз его стошнило — несмотря на то, что чай он не выпил; хватило и той дозы радиации, которую он получил, просто сидя рядом с чашкой. Литвиненко не придал этому значения. Так, ни о чем не подозревая, он пережил свое первое столкновение с полонием.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>В час ночи Луговой и Ковтун вернулись в свою гостиницу. Судя по всему, Луговой, находясь в своем номере (107), переместил полоний из одного контейнера в другой, а какую-то часть вещества просто отправил в раковину. В сливном отверстии счетчик радиации показал сильное загрязнение — 1500 импульсов в секунду. Более низкие показания были зафиксированы повсюду в ванной комнате и в спальнях, а также в 306 номере, где остановился Ковтун.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38c4a6499623a183027485879d8a543a507aa415\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/38c4a6499623a183027485879d8a543a507aa415/0_0_1788_1880/951.jpg\" alt=\"Metropolitan Police’s 3D graphic showing polonium contamination on the green baize tablecloth in Grosvenor Square Photograph: Guardian graphics/Litvinenko Inquiry\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Заражение радиоактивным полонием в комнате на четвертом этаже дома 25 по Гросвенор-стрит.

Луговой утверждал, что они остались недовольны номерами в первой гостинице. Однако, скорее всего, причина была в желании держаться подальше от яда, который он вылил в раковину.</p> <p>На ресепшене русских встретила менеджер Parkes Джулиана Рондини. Поговорив с ней, Луговой попросил ее посоветовать «веселое место», чтобы «познакомиться с девушками». Рондини, привычная к подобным просьбам, посоветовала им обратиться в дом напротив. «Там был известный бордель», — рассказывала она. В качестве второго варианта она предложила им итальянский ресторан: «Там можно было поесть пиццу, а заодно повеселиться и снять девочек. Скажем так, пицца с бонусами».<br /></p> <p>Около 23:30 Луговой позвонил Литвиненко и предложил развлечься. Он рассказал, что они с Ковтуном заказали рикшу и собирались час кататься по центру Лондона — убийцы на отдыхе наслаждались яркой жизнью Сохо. Рикша оказался поляком, который неплохо говорил по-русски. Его они тоже спросили «про девочек». Тот посоветовал закрытый клуб на Джермин-стрит — место пользовалось популярностью у богатых русских.</p> <p>Клуб назывался HeyJo — его основал в 2005 году Дэйв Уэст, бывший торговец овощами и фруктами из Эссекса. Зеркала на стенах, розовые кабинки в рюшечках, официантки в костюмах медсестер-проказниц. Также в заведении были танцпол, русский ресторан Abracadabra с серебряными столами и туалеты с кранами в виде пенисов. Нашлось в HeyJo место и для бронзового фаллоса.</p> <p>Луговой и Ковтун провели в HeyJo два часа. Следователи обнаружили следы радиации на подушках в кабинке № 9, а также на скамейке, одном из столиков в ресторане и на двери в мужской туалет. Ни на бронзовом фаллосе, ни на танцполе следов полония не нашли — очевидно, танцевать московские гости не стали.</p> <p>Судя по всему, не только танцевать — наутро, когда они выписывались из гостиницы, чтобы отправиться в аэропорт, Рондини спросила Лугового, как они провели ночь. Тот, вопреки обыкновению, честно ответил: «Нам не повезло». </p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Можно только гадать о том, как Луговой объяснил неудачную попытку отравления Литвиненко своему начальству в ФСБ. Видимо, все прошло спокойно, поскольку уже через несколько дней он вернулся в Великобританию, на этот раз один, везя при себе новый контейнер с радиоактивным веществом. В Лондон он прибыл 25 октября рейсом 875 авиакомпании British Airways из Москвы. Луговой летел бизнес-классом, в кресле 6К. </p> <p>В начале первого ночи он приехал в Sheraton Park Lane — гостиницу в здании со стилизованными античными колоннами, выходящими на улицу Пикадилли. Внутри гостиница оказалось довольно обшарпанной. Луговой заселился в номер 848.</p> <p>Наутро он встретился с Литвиненко на первом этаже чайной Palm Court — заведения, оформленного в стиле высокого ар-деко и украшенного китайскими картинами, вазами и светильниками. С собой у Лугового были две сим-карты Orange — «чтобы у них была возможность безопасно общаться». Литвиненко пил чай, поданный в серебряном чайнике. Луговой заказал три бокала красного вина и кубинскую сигару.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0ebf261fed94e283d78cd80b0fb23c06c8d4aae\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c0ebf261fed94e283d78cd80b0fb23c06c8d4aae/194_281_2980_2166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Litvinenko holds a copy of the report after receiving the results of the inquiry into the death of her husband.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Вдова Александра Литвиненко, Марина, с экземпляром доклада, подготовленного по итогам расследования гибели ее мужа.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>По невыясненным причинам, Луговой не стал применять очередной сосуд с полонием. Возможно, потому, что в Palm Court работали видеокамеры, либо он опасался, что за ним следят. Следили ли за ним британцы? Нет. Возможно также, что он получил из Москвы новые указания. Так или иначе, он принял решение свернуть операцию. </p> <p>Однако возникала проблема: как поступить с ядом? Луговой решил не усложнять — он снова опорожнил контейнер в раковину в своем гостиничном номере. В этот раз он протер раковину полотенцами. Полотенца Луговой оставил в номере, а контейнер выкинул в урну, стоявшую рядом с унитазом.</p> <p>Ученые, обследовавшие номер Лугового, обнаружили в помещении сцену из фильма о ядерном апокалипсисе. Направив счетчик радиации на входную дверь, они получили показания в 30 тысяч импульсов в секунду. Внутри заражение было еще выше, а в ванной комнате, рядом с урной, счетчик зашкаливал. Радиация была повсюду: на стене под раковиной, на полу, на двери в ванную комнату.</p> <p>Ученые были одеты в защитные костюмы, но, увидев показания своих счетчиков, попросились наружу. Обследование прекратили из соображений безопасности.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/06/alexander-litvinenko-and-the-most-radioactive-towel-in-history\">Alexander Litvinenko and the most radioactive towel in history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Два месяца спустя следователи смогли найти оставленные Луговым полотенца — персонал отправил их в прачечную через специальную металлическую шахту, проходящую через все здание гостиницы и ведущую в подвал. Там они и оставались. Уровень радиации был такой, что полотенца пришлось отправить в правительственный <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Weapons_Establishment\">Центр атомного оружия</a> в Алдермастоне. </p> <p>Уровень заражения оказался беспрецедентным: банное полотенце излучало 6000 импульсов в секунду, или 130 тысяч беккерелей на квадратный сантиметр. Полотенце для рук изначально показало 10 тысяч импульсов в секунду, но затем повторный тест показал невероятные 17 миллионов беккерелей на квадратный сантиметр.</p> <p>Чтобы было проще понять: доза радиации, эквивалентная от 10 до 30 миллионов беккерелей, при попадании в кровь взрослого мужчины приведет к смерти в течение месяца. Полотенце оказалось самым радиоактивным объектом, обнаруженным Скотленд-Ярдом в ходе почти десятилетнего расследования убийства Литвиненко. И, возможно, самым радиоактивным полотенцем в истории.</p> <p><a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2016/03/12/samoe-radioaktivnoe-polotentse-v-mire\"><em>Перевод Константина Бенюмова</em></a></p> <p><em>Опубликованный отрывок взят из книги Люка Хардинга “Очень дорогой яд” (издательство Guardian Faber, розничная цера 12 фунтов 99 пенсов).

In <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/getting-square-in-a-jerking-circle/\">Getting Square in a Jerking Circle</a>, the Sydney writer Luke Carman delivers an extended jeremiad against the Melbourne literary scene. </p> <p>In tones of considerable venom, Carman excoriates arts administrators in general and Melbourne’s City of Literature pretensions in particular. His targets are “the social climbers of the arts”: arts administrators at creative institutions – journals, festivals, funding bodies and hubs – working in that most notorious<em> cosa nostra</em>, “the Melbourne literati mafia”.</p> <p>These godfathers (often godmothers) of the Melbourne “lit-mob”, he says, are “anti-artists”, in it only for the allure of literary power. Carman writes that these “Melbourne-centred lit-scene mobsters” are “a cultish cabal holding the country’s literary ‘stakeholders’ to ransom”, who are corrupting “the consciousness of young Australian writers”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2015/dec/14/literati-cities-just-the-spot-for-networking-less-so-for-writing-a-great-novel\">Literati cities: just the spot for networking, less so for writing a great novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you read Carman’s essay aloud in the right voice – perhaps at a writers’ festival event – this all becomes hysterically funny. The delicious image of a group of hipster dons assassinating their literary enemies from a special table at the Wheeler Centre’s Moat bar is luridly evocative.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the essay has got tongues wagging in Australia’s tight-knit writing community. Some, like the Newcastle writer Emmett Stinson, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmettStinson/status/709574328833040384\">have argued</a> that the sensitive reaction to Carman’s essay in the Melbourne literary scene unintentionally proves his point about a cabal of glad-handing self-congratulators.</p> <p>Others are more concerned about the bomb-throwing nature of Carman’s provocation. In a thoughtful response to the essay, Jessica Friedmann <a href=\"http://jessicafriedmann.com/blog/2016/3/12/from-a-great\">points out</a> that Carman’s sidelong reference in the essay to mental illness – “Want someone to stand in as a borderline personality spokesperson? Speak to their agent,” he writes – is “breathtakingly callous”, given the very serious issues posed by mental illness in the artistic world.</p> <p>The Melbourne writer Ellena Savage responded <a href=\"http://theliftedbrow.com/post/141055770227/boiling-the-pot-by-ellena-savage\">more generously</a>, arguing that Carman “brashly articulates the simmering rage felt by many, if not most, working artists in Australia”. Artists must endure low pay and precarious conditions, and arts administrators are often the conduits of this insecurity.</p> <p>But the most common reaction has been head-scratching. Ironically, Carman’s article has confused many of the people he might have been thought to be attacking.</p> <p>That’s not to say Carman is completely off-beam. He argues that “the literary arts in this country have been abandoned to cultural guerrillas who seek nothing but to further their interests” – and it’s true that the interests of festival curators and writers don’t always align. Industry politics and strings-attached patronage have always been a distasteful part of cultural endeavour, as Balzac lamented in his masterpiece Lost Illusions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/25/perils-writing-in-solitude-george-orwell-thoreau\">A lonely story: the perils of writing in solitude</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Savage notes, there are also genuine labour market issues afflicting the cultural industries. For all the rhetoric of “paying the writers”, fees for published work in Australia remain depressed and large masses of poorly paid writers and artists compete in a cut-throat freelance market. Only a lucky few can earn enough income from their writing to pay the rent in a big Australian city, so it’s easy to see why hostility runs hot against the salaried arts administrator with a steady income. It’s a doleful situation and Carman is right to be angry.</p> <p>Nor is Australia’s critical scene particularly healthy. Newspapers are publishing less criticism and fewer reviews; the web provides writing opportunities but not income. Genuine, thoughtful discussion about Australian culture is getting harder to find. </p> <p>And Carman is surely justified in calling out the defensive and incestuous nature of the literary scene. In a small industry it doesn’t pay to make enemies, so many reviewers pull their punches. Cliques do form. A small number of influential gatekeepers do wield significant power. This is hardly news. In an industry where nearly everyone really <em>is</em> a critic, it’s not surprising there are criticisms.</p> <p>But someone has to do the job of producing an event: choosing the speakers, setting up the venue, cleaning up afterwards. The majority of arts workers are paid barely more than the minimum wage. Mid-level producers and curators from the smaller arts organisations have been among those fighting hardest to roll back the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show\">funding cuts</a>.</p> <p>I emailed Carman on Tuesday in an attempt to better understand what he was getting at. He told me he hadn’t set out to write a deliberately confusing or outrageous essay. “I did not write this article in an attempt to get some kind of click-bait, shock-jock style ‘reaction’,” Carman maintained. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/26/emerging-writers-prize-launched-by-hachette-and-guardian-australia\">Emerging writers prize launched by Hachette and Guardian Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he does seem to have a particular loathing for the directors of writers’ festivals. “The anti-artist takes on the directorship of some literary event, pours their ego into it, then acts as though they climbed up on a cross and died for the nation’s sins,” he wrote in the email.</p> <p>Most industry insiders would argue the truth is more boring. Far from exercising mafia-like power over the Australian literary scene, the majority of writing organisations are barely keeping their head above water. Arts administrators are scrambling to keep the doors open as a slew of funding cuts flows through the sector from George Brandis’ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show\">raid on the Australia Council’s funding</a>. </p> <p>On this analysis, the real threat to Australian culture is not the mafia-like power of arts administrators – it’s the Coalition government, which has slashed more than $160m of federal arts funding since 2013.</p> <p>But while Carman gets plenty wrong, in some crucial respects he is right.</p> <p>There is truth to the accusation that the salaries of festival and gallery directors are way out of line with the reality of ordinary artists’ earnings. While artists and writers struggle, superstars like the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ Michael Brand are earning $500,000 a year. It’s a problem across many artforms: just ask the visual artists, or the musicians.</p> <p>If Carman helps us focus on these inequalities, his provocation is useful. But if the article just leads to another round of arts industry infighting … well, that really would be a circle jerk.

His friends and contacts reflected the broad span of his interests, from Winston Churchill, whose <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/A-History-English-Speaking-Peoples-Winston-Churchill/dp/1616082402\" title=\"\">History of the English-Speaking Peoples</a> Briggs proofread as a young don, to Chairman Mao’s loyal lieutenant Zhou Enlai and J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atom bomb. Friends and neighbours nearer Briggs’s Sussex home included former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">James Callaghan</a>, and fellow peer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/03/lord-healey\" title=\"\">Denis Healey</a>, whom Briggs thought would have made a better prime minister than any of them.</p> <p>Best known for his trilogy on 19th-century social history, Victorian People (1954), Victorian Cities (1963) and Victorian Things (1988), Briggs also wrote a penetrating short essay on Chartism (1959) that has stood the test of time, plus studies of Karl Marx in London and a company history of Marks and Spencer. He was commissioned by the BBC to write a mammoth five-volume history of British broadcasting, which he started in 1961 and completed in 1995. Though he thought it among his finest works, for many its accounts of bygone bureaucratic battles and reliance on internal memos render it a work of reference only.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lEkYirFVLo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lEkYirFVLo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Asa Briggs, the author of a five-volume history of British broadcasting, on pirate radio and the BBC’s response to it</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A key year for Briggs was 1961, as it saw the foundation of the institution with which he became most closely identified, the University of Sussex. In at the university’s start as professor of history and dean of the school of social studies, Briggs served as vice-chancellor between 1967 and 1976. On his retirement he was ennobled as a life peer, Lord Briggs of Lewes, after the town that he had made his home. Briggs’s Sussex era encompassed the years of worldwide student revolt, in which the university played its part. Occasionally Briggs would debate vigorously with crowds of angry protesters on the campus. </p> <p>Asa Briggs – he was always proud of his unusual Yorkshire forename – was born in Keighley, near Bradford, the son of William, and engineer, and his wife Jane. Educated at Keighley grammar school, he went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, at the age of 16, where a tutor told him: “You’re just a baby, Briggs, and there’s a war coming. But get your degree first and then join up.” He did better than that, and got two: a BA in history and a BSc in economics in 1941, before he was 20. </p> <p>By then, he had been spotted by a college contemporary, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-sir-howard-smith-1346505.html\" title=\"\">Howard Smith</a>, a mathematician with whom Briggs played chess, who was to become head of MI5 in the 1970s. Smith recommended him to <a href=\"https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/about/FilmandTV/welchman.rhtm\" title=\"\">Gordon Welchman</a>, another Cambridge mathematician, the head of Hut 6, responsible for breaking Germany’s army and Luftwaffe ciphers at Bletchley Park. Recruited by the Intelligence Corps, in 1942 Briggs found himself among the country’s brightest brains at Bletchley, where he was enchanted by the spirit of equality that prevailed, “except for Turing, whom we all deferred to because he was clearly a genius,” he told me in a 2011 interview. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmqADGoQkXE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmqADGoQkXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Asa Briggs talking about his book Secret Days: Code-breaking at Bletchley Park</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the war’s end, increasingly interested in urban and working-class history, Briggs lectured at the London School of Economics, attracting the attention of the socialist intellectuals RH Tawney, Harold Laski and GDH Cole. He refused an offer of a safe Labour seat in parliament, and was elected a fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, where he remained for a decade until 1955. One of his students there was the future media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, and in 1952 the pair went <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/02/rupert-murdoch-road-trip-middle-east\" title=\"Guardian article on Briggs and Murdoch\">on a camping tour of the middle East</a>. Briggs would return to Worcester as the college’s provost on leaving Sussex in 1976, retiring in 1991. Never a Marxist like his fellow Oxford historians <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/26/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Christopher Hill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-e-p-thompson-1464255.html\" title=\"\">EP Thompson</a>, Briggs retained a sentimental attachment to old Labour ideals throughout his life. </p> <p>One of Briggs’s rare failures was when an article on army slang was rejected by George Orwell, then literary editor of the leftwing weekly Tribune. “I thought it would appeal to him – clearly it didn’t,” recalled Briggs ruefully. </p> <p>A year’s academic appointment at Princeton (1953-54) enabled him to study postwar America and to critique the views of Lewis Mumford on the development of cities, which Mumford regarded as essentially similar, while Briggs stressed their variety.</p> <p>As a historian, Briggs’s hallmark was his breadth of interest and his grasp of the essential in the torrent of diverse material. In contrast to the aggressive capitalism of the US, for example, he observed that in spite of the Victorian boom: “England did not become a business society ... The failure was crucial to the subsequent development of English society and politics.” </p> <p>In 1955, he married Susan Banwell and returned to his native county as professor of history at Leeds University. Always a staunch Yorkshireman, Briggs kept in close touch with his roots, and was a proud president of the Brontë Society. But when the call came from Sussex, Briggs did not hesitate. His involvement with the new university reflected an increasing interest in the extension of higher education, and he was one of those instrumental in persuading Harold Wilson’s Labour government to launch the Open University in 1969. Nine years later Briggs became the OU’s chancellor, a post he held until his retirement in 1991. </p> <p>An indefatigable globetrotter, Briggs was an especially enthusiastic visitor to China in the 1960s, when the country was convulsed by Mao’s bloody and chaotic Cultural Revolution. Briggs, whose chief private hobby was collecting historic ceramics, built up a large collection of Maoist pottery, which he displayed in the windows of his Lewes home. When questioned about this iconography of one of the 20th-century’s worst mass murderers, he conceded that Mao had “probably” been a monster, but added: “We will be arguing about this to the end of time.” </p> <p>In a sense, Briggs remained marooned in the optimistic period of his prime – the 40s to the 60s – a believer above all in what he called in one of his best books <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Improvement-1783-1867-Edition/dp/0582369592\" title=\"\">The Age of Improvement</a> (1959). He remained steadfast in his commitment to the education and improvement of the masses, exemplified by his beloved Victorians, and the provincial class and region from which he sprang. From 1958 to 1967 he served as president of the Workers’ Eudcational Association.</p> <p>His socialist sympathies notwithstanding, he joined the ranks of the Establishment, and moved in such exalted company with ease, glorying in the many honours (and the grand houses) that came with his academic posts. After leaving Oxford, he and his wife bought part of <a href=\"http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst282.html\" title=\"\">Tyninghame House</a>, a 19th-century stately home in East Lothian. Not without personal vanity, he took a positively Pooterish joy in mingling with the powerful.</p> <p>A great committee man, and an enemy of narrow specialisation, he said that he leapt over the frontiers of academic disciplines with as much joy as he crossed national borders. If he had been born a century earlier, he would himself have been among the most energetic of the eminent Victorians that he celebrated. His book Loose Ends and Extras (2014) completed an autobiographical trilogy, and a collection of poetry is due to be published in April.</p> <p>Briggs is survived by Susan, their two sons, two daughters and 14 grandchildren.</p> <p>• Asa Briggs, Lord Briggs of Lewes, historian, born 7 May 1921; died 15 March

It was described as ‘excessively voracious and appears to be disposed to eat almost without cessation’. Its greed was its undoing, for one day in the summer of 1828 it ‘over-gorged itself one day at breakfast and died’. Its stuffed skin ended up, appropriately, in the Zoological Society’s museum.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2dab6f297421aeada85b99295553d67bcbcdcab\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c2dab6f297421aeada85b99295553d67bcbcdcab/0_0_672_500/672.jpg\" alt=\"Greenland caribou\" width=\"672\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From the early 18th century onwards, increasing numbers of private individuals started collections of exotic animals. These were usually housed on country estates, but Hans Sloane kept a wide variety at his home in Chelsea, where the unusual household pets included a one-eyed wolverine from Hudson’s Bay. In 1738 Captain Craycott brought him a pair of caribou from Greenland, which were drawn by George Edwards before being sent on to the Duke of Richmond’s estate at Goodwood in the hope that they might breed. They died shortly afterwards.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad0e50c20cdf61a6722cfde20e1c3d830d1affa7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ad0e50c20cdf61a6722cfde20e1c3d830d1affa7/0_0_2721_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke of Richmond’s Java Hare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke of Richmond’s menagerie included wolves and leopards, a lioness, a civet, a ‘tyger catt’, foxes, a jackal, two Greenland dogs, three vultures, two eagles, a kite, two owls, at least three bears, a ‘white’ bear, a large monkey, three raccoons, three small monkeys, an armadillo, a peccary, and seven cassowaries. Among his household pets was a ‘tame and inoffensive ... Java hare’ recorded for posterity in a 1747 edition of Mark Catesby’s <em>Natural History of Carolina</em>. It was neither a hare nor from Java – it was the first agouti from South America to be recorded in England.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d819517302f572ad9e3c65cdcb8cc790cc2af4ac\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d819517302f572ad9e3c65cdcb8cc790cc2af4ac/0_0_1475_1781/828.jpg\" alt=\"The Gamboa Groasbeak\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke of Chandos acquired Canons Park in 1713, and set about transforming the estate into one of the grandest in England, complete with a collection of exotic animals from Africa and the New World. His letters show that he had a genuine interest in animals, both his own and those that he had seen exhibited in London. He fed the cranes that stalked around the garden terraces with his own hand and allowed Eleazer Albin to study the birds in his famous aviary – ‘The Gamboa Groasbeak ... from coast of Guinea’, is described and illustrated in Albin’s <em>Natural History of Birds</em> (1738).</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0707ce0f102974b03f1b7549d189a31d39b02cfd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0707ce0f102974b03f1b7549d189a31d39b02cfd/0_0_3068_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female zebra standing in an enclosure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Various members of the royal family kept collections of exotic animals on their estates at Richmond and Kew. During the 1740s, Frederick Prince of Wales was sent a pair of zebras from the Cape of Good Hope. The stallion died en route, but the mare lived at Kew for several years. George Edwards drew her in 1751, and published an engraving in his<em> Gleanings of Natural History</em>. This shows her with dark brown stripes on a brownish background which fade out towards her rump – the coloration of a quagga, extinct since 1883 and now considered to have been a sub-species of the plains zebra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wellcome Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01262c1a3549fa847383af1155ce2ddc43d1e559\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/01262c1a3549fa847383af1155ce2ddc43d1e559/0_0_1481_2074/714.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Twynnoy’s tombstone at Malmesbury Abbey\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exotic animals were not simply objects of enjoyment or curiosity, good money could be paid from exhibiting them ‘to be seen or sold’ at London pubs and fairs. An Indian elephant was shown at the Rising Star in 1675, an Indian rhinoceros at the Belle Sauvage in 1684, and a short-lived chimp, which had arrived with slaves from West Africa in 1698, was displayed at Moncrieff’s coffee house. Animals were occasionally shown in provincial towns, as Hannah Twynnoy’s tombstone at Malmesbury Abbey attests. Note the use of the generic term ‘tyger’ for most large cats – it was probably a leopard.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79c2ff8d343dd1fb2654d3dcb8f9d16b37f35442\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/79c2ff8d343dd1fb2654d3dcb8f9d16b37f35442/0_0_1188_827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A ‘Numidian’ lion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Gilbert Pidcock’s travelling menagerie visited Newcastle in 1788, Edward Bewick took the opportunity to draw several of the animals, including this tame ‘Numidian’ lion from Algiers, described in advertisements as ‘one of the finest lions (very lately brought over)’. The resulting woodcut was published in his <em>General History of Quadrupeds </em>(1790).</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de18e2ae56ac61e3c626c3a5df9b70b54cf0f1f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6de18e2ae56ac61e3c626c3a5df9b70b54cf0f1f/0_0_1355_2568/528.jpg\" alt=\"Farthing from Pidcock’s menagerie\" width=\"528\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The best known commercial menagerie of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was housed on the second floor of the Exeter Change on the Strand in London. It was started in 1778 by Thomas Clarke, and showed some of the first Australian marsupials seen in Britain, including a bettong (kangaroo-rat), a flying phalanger and a kangaroo. Pidcock took over the entire operation in 1793, promoting it with exuberant newspaper adverts and a flood of handbills. Dozens of coins like this two-sided farthing token were produced with images of the more spectacular animals, perhaps as keepsakes for visitors.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c64f10cab2b6e7488c59bfcd53d5c0f0e8c809a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1c64f10cab2b6e7488c59bfcd53d5c0f0e8c809a/0_0_3072_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An engraving of a boxing kangaroo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More kangaroos arrived, not only at the Exeter Change, and soon began to breed, so that by 1805 Thomas Smith could remark that ‘these animals may now be considered as in some degree naturalized in England’. One of Pidcock’s largest kangaroos had ‘remarkable pugilistic skills’, Smith wrote. ‘I saw this noble quadruped wrestle with the keeper for the space of ten or fifteen minutes, during which time he evinced the utmost intrepidity and sagacity…’ This may be the first picture of what has since become a national symbol of Australia – the boxing kangaroo.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99de9aa11fdc1dfc922dbac52b1894045480c183\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/99de9aa11fdc1dfc922dbac52b1894045480c183/0_0_2109_1207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plains viscacha\" width=\"1000\" height=\"572\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The menagerie at the Exeter Change was taken over successively by Stephen Polito in 1810 and Edward Cross in 1814, both of whom also toured some of the animals around the country. Cross owned mammals of scientific importance including this so-called marmot – illustrated, like many other animals from the Exeter Change in Edward Griffith’s edition of Georges Cuvier’s <em>The Animal Kingdom</em> (1827). It was actually a previously unknown species, the plains viscacha, first scientifically described by the surgeon Joshua Brookes in 1828.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e86370211f8d2cda8474d70bf65dad37d160f14e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e86370211f8d2cda8474d70bf65dad37d160f14e/0_0_1942_1014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clouded leopard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"522\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first clouded leopard known to science, said to have arrived from Canton in about 1817 and kept at the Exeter Change, was named by Edward Griffiths in 1821 as the ‘clouded tiger’. Its skin was lost to science because the animal was ‘taken into the country with an itinerant exhibition and died there, and so little attention did Zoology, at that time, receive here, that as far as appears, its skin was cut up to make caps for the keepers’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c81466a1d2c58489315bdfbaa30dff5e8d8f98fc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c81466a1d2c58489315bdfbaa30dff5e8d8f98fc/0_0_2249_1376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Castlereagh's 'black-maned' lion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"612\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Castlereagh kept a menagerie at North Cray in Kent with a mocking bird, ‘nutmeg birds’, a flying squirrel, an antelope, several kangaroos, emus, a pair of ostriches and a puma or jaguar. Her husband liked to boast that he was the only person at the Coronation of George IV in 1821 who wore a plume of ostrich feathers from his own birds. Her magnificent ‘black-maned’ lion from South Africa was perhaps too dangerous to be kept at Cray – she gave it to Edward Cross at the Exeter Change, where it was drawn by Thomas Landseer. The resulting engraving was published by Griffiths in 1827.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"227f13a40ce3f779dfcfb7c7ae0b6ce3ad4445d6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/227f13a40ce3f779dfcfb7c7ae0b6ce3ad4445d6/0_35_931_1248/746.jpg\" alt=\"Flyer for Wombwell’s Royal Menagerie\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1831, after over 600 years of almost continuous operation, the menagerie at the Tower of London was closed and the animals moved to the newly-opened Zoological Gardens in Regent’s Park. Animals brought to England must have suffered terribly both on board ship and in their cramped cages on arrival, but – at the time of the transatlantic slave trade – were people treated any better? In 1850, George Wombwell’s obituary paid tribute to the educational value of his travelling menageries, arguing that ‘no one has done so much to forward practically the study of natural history among the masses’.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a78ca792278a34f087a918605386a7559e2f8bcd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a78ca792278a34f087a918605386a7559e2f8bcd/0_0_919_1418/648.jpg\" alt=\"Menagerie by Caroline Grigson\" width=\"648\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/13/menagerie-the-history-of-exotic-animals-in-england-caroline-grigson-review\">Review: Menagerie by Caroline Grigson (OUP)</a><br><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/362093/\">Buy it at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OUP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h9gx","wordcount":"0","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4f6fe502d990d445799d3a336c60a7652804e26c/112_140_3041_1826/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-30T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Exotic animals have been kept in Britain for more than eight centuries, inspiring wonder and terror in those who saw them – despite the cruelties of their captivity.

Her magnificent ‘black-maned’ lion from South Africa was perhaps too dangerous to be kept at Cray – she gave it to Edward Cross at the Exeter Change, where it was drawn by Thomas Landseer.

One of them was “19th-century art criticism in England and France”. Anita Brookner taught our students about Baudelaire while I was deputed to introduce them to Ruskin and Pater. This was in 1966.</p> <p>Thus we formed an unlikely friendship. Anita would never enter a pub, but we sometimes had a drink in a little cafe opposite the Archives Nationales in Paris, and she liked lunching in the restaurant at Fenwick’s in Bond Street. A quarter of a trout would fill her.</p> <p>She was smartly dressed, but in those days often wore ornate dark glasses, used bright red lipstick and chain-smoked tipped Woodbines. Anita often spent the cocktail hour in Blunt’s flat on the top floor of the Courtauld building. As soon as she got home to South Kensington, she told me, she went to bed with piles of empty exercise books in which she wrote novels, in French.

country’s new makar, or national poet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

on Tuesday, Kay said she hoped to “open up the conversations, the blethers, the arguments and celebrations that Scotland has with itself and with the rest of the world”.</p> <p>Kay told the Guardian it was “an extraordinary time to be Scottish” particularly since the surge in political engagement after the 2014 independence referendum campaign. </p> <p>“It was a really exciting time to be living through and it continues to be. As a poet, you have a relationship with your country all of the time. I think Scotland is finding a way to have a really interesting conversation with itself, but also we are looking outwards to the world.” </p> <p>Kay became the third poet to take the post since it was established in 2004, succeeding Liz Lochhead and her mentor Edwin Morgan, Scotland’s first makar.</p> <p>Apart from appearing in larger venues, Kay, who is known for the warmth and humour of her performances, said she planned to take poetry to “small and unexpected places”.</p> <p>The first thing she wanted to write about in her new role was the islands: “Often big cities get the attention, but I would like to address the people of the islands and the peninsula.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9fb15b214c8ba0227a38001ab9502d9e3c494c6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a9fb15b214c8ba0227a38001ab9502d9e3c494c6/0_41_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kay is interviewed after her appointment as the new makar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kay is interviewed after her appointment as the new makar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writer, who divides her time between Manchester and Glasgow, won the Guardian fiction prize in 1998 for her first novel, Trumpet, and was awarded an MBE for services to literature in 2006.

Looking at those photos now, you see a square tuxedo with a man stuffed into it. A bulging face, no neck to speak of, tiny eyes behind enormous glasses, classic wavy hair. And a Barbarella babe next to him in a delirious dress, her teeth bared by a smile so strained it looks like she’s putting her face through an aerobics workout.</p> <p> ‘Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.’ He was referring to those women, but didn’t think his theory through enough to realise it applied to him too. In the run-up to the presidential election of 1968 he’d called Richard Nixon ‘unfit to be president’, but when President Nixon called him three weeks after winning to make him National Security Advisor, he didn’t hesitate for a moment. He too felt his knees quiver and his heart pound when faced with the true power of the White House.</p> <p> ‘Will you be my National Security Advisor?’</p> <p> ‘Oh, I will, Richard. Yes, I will.’</p> <p> We recognized him from some thirty metres, maybe more. He was walking towards us from the Louvre. A small, elderly man with a walking stick, flanked by three much younger men who were obviously security. On our right, the Seine. Left, the Jardin des Tuileries, the Orangerie, the rue de Rivoli with its palatial hotels and Armani stores. Behind us the place de la Concorde with Napoleon’s enormous Obelisk and further in that direction the Grand Palais, the Champs-Élysées, and the Arc de Triomphe, which even Hitler marched around rather than through, out of respect for the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. We were surrounded by echoes of the past.</p> <p> It had to be one of the most touristy spots in France, close to the museum’s inverted glass pyramid, one hundred and fifty metres away from the undocumented Liberians and Senegalese trying to flog Eiffel Tower key rings to indifferent tourists. If you had two hours to kill in Paris, this was the place to go and that was why we were here – one and a half hours before we were due to report at the Gare du Nord – but the tourists rarely left the main route through the former palace gardens, so you could still stroll peacefully along paths of fine gravel of the kind that is undoubtedly very good for playing boules.</p> <p> Look, could it possibly, surely not, is that, could that really be, we said to each other, but there was no doubt in our minds. It had been some four decades since he’d held a cabinet post, and more than not being able to remember the last time we’d seen him on TV, we couldn’t remember <em>ever</em> having seen him on TV apart from archival footage.</p> <p> He was walking slowly and we too slowed our pace. We wanted to delay the moment, the moment our paths would cross and we’d be able to look him in the eye. Ten metres, six metres, three metres and then, to my surprise, my brother stepped over to him.</p> <p> ‘Excuse me, Mr Kissinger, could we please take a picture?’ Immediately adding, ‘I am such a big fan of your book, Diplomacy.’</p> <p> The security men held back for a moment. ‘Ah well, ah well,’ mumbled the former Secretary of State, who didn’t even reach my brother’s shoulder. He seemed to be amused. My brother put on his big, fake, photo grin, while one of Kissinger’s assistants smiled professionally and said, firmly, ‘Please, just one picture.’</p> <p> Their faces were next to each other on the screen of my iPhone. I knew Hugo’s all too well, but Kissinger’s was a feast for the eyes. His skin was leathery and crumpled and angular, like an old leather travelling bag. Gravity had taken hold of his eyelids and not let go; they were watery and drooping. The same for his lower lip. Once so strong, his face had collapsed. It was past it, but his eyes were clear and icy blue and burning through the lenses of the square glasses that rested on his potato nose like twin television sets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of Kissinger’s assistants smiled professionally and said, firmly, ‘Please, just one picture'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> In that moment I thought about all the things you could know about him. In the thirties he’d fled Germany with his family to escape the Nazis, he’d become a brilliant academic at Harvard, joined Nixon’s government in the late sixties, successfully pursued détente with China and the Soviet Union, let the Vietnam War escalate, squandering tens of thousands of lives, so he could de-escalate it later on his own terms and win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. The peace negotiations had been held here in Paris. He was history personified – war and peace. This old man supported fascist regimes in Latin America, probably had Salvador Allende murdered, delayed informing the president about the Yom Kippur until it was too late for mediation, deliberately left thousands to starve to death in Bangladesh. And now he was here.</p> <p> Click, said my camera.</p> <p> ‘Thank you, thank you,’ said Kissinger. ‘Good day, good day.’</p> <p> ‘Great meeting you, sir,’ we said.</p> <p> We didn’t walk on, but watched him walk away with his support staff. They left the gardens a little further along, heading out to the road where a car was undoubtedly waiting. We didn’t say anything. I could imagine that he’d done some shopping, that he had his regular addresses on the rue Saint-Honoré, the place Vendôme.</p> <p> ‘Wow. Henry Kissinger,’ Hugo said at last.</p> <p> ‘Yes, smashing,’ I said.</p> <p> ‘Super.’</p> <p> ‘Absolutely.’</p> <p> We looked at each other.</p> <p> ‘He should have been chucked in prison years ago.’</p> <p> ‘On bread and water, the bastard.’</p> <p> We laughed, of course.</p> <p><em>Translated from the Dutch by</em> <em>David Colmer</em><br /></p> <p><em>*****</em></p> <ul> <li>This translation appears by courtesy of <a href=\"http://dasmag.co.uk/\">Das Mag</a> and will appear in full in the special English-language edition out April 12.<br /></li> <li> <em><strong>Joost de Vries</strong> (1983) is a Dutch novelist and essayist.

A girl named Sophie is recruited to work in a new department store called Sinclairs. She is very exited but all the other girls that work there think she is useless and generally funny to laugh at. Then one cold night Sophie forgets something at the store and has to go back, leaving her cosy apartment behind. She gets what she was looking for and comes out. Then a nasty boy from the store comes up to her and won’t let her past.</p> <p>Suddenly Mr Sinclair’s assistant comes out and Sophie slips away. Then a strange person comes, takes the clockwork sparrow as well as shooting the nasty boy! Everyone now thinks that Sophie shot him because she was witnessed with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d9c67e44d32f6388b4f93d2f2afd122aae1ffa21\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9c67e44d32f6388b4f93d2f2afd122aae1ffa21/0_0_310_475/310.jpg\" alt=\"The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow\" width=\"310\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I love this exiting book because it is full of mystery and astonishing cliffhangers. The way the book is written and all of the things that happen in the book are really fantastic. Katherine Woodfine is an awesome writer and an amazing storyteller. I love the whole atmosphere about it too because the book is set in a shopping plaza and then a crime happens in a place where beauty is nurtured. The plot and perspective is exceptional and everything about it is great. I hope you read this book and like it as much as I have done. </p> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/295174/s/the-mystery-of-the-clockwork-sparrow/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>bunkbedbobby: </strong>‘I love this exiting book because it is full of mystery and astonishing cliffhangers’","headline":"The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow by Katherine Woodfine -

The term, proposed by <a href=\"http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~frank/Documents/InSearchUncannyValley.pdf\">engineering professor Masahiro Mori in 1970</a>, is normally applied to human responses to animations, robots or computer imagery that is so recognisably like us that any tiny difference is all the more noticeable, and disconcerting or even horrifying. It’s territory in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jgballard\">JG Ballard</a> seems to have spent a lot of time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/mar/08/high-rises-flat-moral-challenge-reader-jg-ballard\">High-Rise: Ballard's detached tone presents a steep moral challenge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the unsettling things about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/mar/08/high-rises-flat-moral-challenge-reader-jg-ballard\">High-Rise, Ballard’s 1975 novel</a>, is how close it comes to our normal human experience, while skewing it. We can, for example, recognise that the setting has foundations in reality. We know about tower blocks: malfunctioning lifts, power outages; the petty inconveniences of life in the building seem all too familiar (and presumably had even greater resonance when the book was first published).<br /></p> <p>The people, too, are instantly recognisable: 70s sophisticates, partygoers, social climbers. They are aspirational, middle-class, everyday. Ballard emphasises their normality by labelling them according to professional type – doctors, TV presenters, architects and lecturers. Partly, he shows them as respectable, successful people because there’s a thrill of dissonance in observing the gulf between their working lives and their activities in the tower.</p> <p>Partly also, it’s funny to see the thrusting middle classes living in their own mess. It’s a joke that works especially well because it’s at our expense. Ballard’s readers are more likely than most to see something of themselves in those university-educated, chattering-class hooligans. He chose these people because he knew they would resonate most strongly with his intended victims: us.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a3091b5d5728eec88cf69795d77d67a92f07f1d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3a3091b5d5728eec88cf69795d77d67a92f07f1d/0_0_3421_5045/678.jpg\" alt=\"JG Ballard outside his home in Shepperton, Surrey, in 1973, two years before High-Rise was published.\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JG Ballard outside his home in Shepperton, Surrey, in 1973, two years before High-Rise was published.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We Ballardians, chatterers, readers of broadsheet newspapers and speculative literary fiction can’t help but feel kinship with the inhabitants of High-Rise. He holds up a mirror. When Royal, the architect designer of the dysfunctional building, sprouts horns, so does our reflection. When everyone begins to run amok, it feels all the stranger because it is happening in our world.<br /></p> <p>High-Rise contains enough that is (in a phrase Ballard repeats throughout the novel) “matter-of-fact” to make the fantasy seem more lurid. The book’s realism makes it uncanny.<br /></p> <p>Perhaps “reality” is the wrong word. Ballard often maintained he was “surreal”. “The essence of the surrealist imagination,” he told a German magazine, “is its ability to translate the apparent forms of the world, the outer forms, into inner ones, into mental forms. The surrealist painter doesn’t seek to interpret the outer world as the classic schools of painting did … the surrealists recreate the outer world, completely in fact. And this was exactly the right method for SF, which needs something very similar. I used this concept of ‘psychological space’, and that again I found in surrealist paintings. I thought, that’s exactly what I need in science fiction.”<br /></p> <p>That idea can clearly be applied to the strange conditions whereby the High-Rise building seems to have a mind of its own and the real is so out of kilter. Ballard was a surrealist. High-Rise is strange, disturbing and disconnected from most normal experience. Yet the novel draws much of its power from ‘the real world’ and historical fact. Ballard suggested it had direct inspirations.<br /></p> <p>In 1978, <a href=\"http://www.jgballard.ca/media/1978_reprinted_1988_search%26destroy_newspaper.html\">he told Jon Savage </a>(then a young punk journalist writing for Search &amp; Destroy) that he first had the idea for High-Rise thanks to “the most incredible triviality” of the arguments that used to break out in a luxurious block of flats near his parents house in Victoria. There, Ballard said, the residents “spent all their time bickering with one another, complaining about small things constantly: ‘Who’s going to pay for the maintenance of the potted plant display on the 17th floor landing?’”<br /></p> <p>He went on to tell a story of renting a flat on the Costa Brava (near, he enjoyed pointing out, to “Dali’s place”). Most of those in the resort were middle-class French: “they all had their bloody boats”. And they, too, spent an “enormous amount of their time” bickering about nothing. One of the residents filled in the hours “with his back to the sea” training his camera on Ballard’s 12-storey apartment block. </p> <p>Ballard at first assumed the man was a “peeping Tom” because, he said “my girlfriend was walking around in the nude”. But the author eventually realised the man was taking photos because of “an enormous amount of antagonism between the people of the lower floors and the people in the top”. He was snapping people dropping cigarette ends and other rubbish from the upper floors on to lower balconies. The man announced this, eventually, by putting up a sign threatening to shame the litterbugs by pinning his photos on a noticeboard. “Who would believe it? A holiday in this expensive block, and here’s this guy so upset with the misbehaviour of those people on the 12th floor, that he stands with his back to the sea, with his camera, waiting to catch somebody in the act. Some guy who’s probably a dentist, so obsessed with the sort of hostilities that are so easily provoked.”<br /></p> <p>So far, so High-Rise, and funny. But there’s a crueller reality. The novel might have drawn some immediate inspiration from this bickering and rivalry on the Spanish Costa, but the violence and extremism had another source. Ballard had experienced confinement, isolation and societal breakdown in the second world war, when he was interned in a Shanghai prisoner of war camp. Physical imagery from this experience coloured his writing (the dried-up and discoloured swimming pools were something he saw in Shanghai). He had also seen the moral abdication of middle-class professionals – including his own parents – when cast adrift and thrust into a fight for survival.<br /></p> <p>Possibly the most upsetting thing about the sense of the uncanny valley in JG Ballard’s book isn’t where the novel deviates from humanity. It’s where there’s a deeper reality behind the fantasy; where the apparently strange acts of his protagonists have historical precedent. Where the unlikely starts to feel all too familiar. Where we realise that truly frightening people walk among us. That they might be you and I.<br /></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hh53","wordcount":"1033","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f8b261caea93beaa4808cb726acb8f34d58d9817/0_179_5493_3296/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Doctors, lecturers, architects run amok in Ballard’s tower blocks, capitalising on our fear of the weirdness that walks among us</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/uncanny-valley-jg-ballard-high-rise-reading-group-tower-blocks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/mar/15/uncanny-valley-jg-ballard-high-rise-reading-group-tower-blocks","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8b261caea93beaa4808cb726acb8f34d58d9817","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f8b261caea93beaa4808cb726acb8f34d58d9817/0_179_5493_3296/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2012 Rex Features.

Last September, he was signed by Marvel to write <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/22/ta-nehisi-coates-to-write-marvels-black-panther-comic\">a new series of Black Panther comics</a>, called A Nation Under Our Feet. The Black Panther character, T’Challa, is the head of the wealthy, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. When he made his debut on the page in 1966, he was the first mainstream black superhero.</p> <p>The first issue in the new series, illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze, is out on 6 April. Coates unveiled pages from the comic <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-return-of-the-black-panther/471516/\">in the Atlantic</a>, where he wrote that in his journalism for the magazine he has “been asking a particular question: can a society part with, and triumph over, the very plunder that made it possible? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bde050ba035a6ed9ec2d249740cb05362e417eb9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bde050ba035a6ed9ec2d249740cb05362e417eb9/0_339_2003_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ta-Nehisi Coates at the 2015 National Book awards in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ta-Nehisi Coates at the 2015 National Book awards in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Platzer/Twin Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In Black Panther there is a simpler question: can a good man be a king, and would an advanced society tolerate a monarch?” he wrote. “Research is crucial in both cases. The Black Panther I offer pulls from the archives of Marvel and the character’s own long history. But it also pulls from the very real history of society – from the precolonial era of Africa, the peasant rebellions that wracked Europe toward the end of the middle ages, the American civil war, the Arab spring and the rise of Isis.”</p> <p>Marvel has said that in A Nation Under Our Feet there will be “dramatic upheaval” in Wakanda, as the Black Panther “struggles to do right by his people as their ruler”.</p> <p>“The indomitable will of Wakanda – the famed African nation known for its vast wealth, advanced technology and warrior traditions – has long been reflected in the will of its monarchs, the Black Panthers,” said the publisher. “Now the current Black Panther, T’Challa, finds that will tested by a superhuman terrorist group called the People that has sparked a violent uprising among the citizens of Wakanda. T’Challa knows the country must change to survive. The question is: will the Black Panther survive the change?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-return-of-the-black-panther/471516/\" data-alt=\"Ta-Nehisi Coates speaks with the Atlantic about writing the forthcoming Black Panther series - video\">  <iframe src='http://www.theatlantic.com/video/embed/?brightcove_id=4792142562001' allowfullscreen frameborder=0></iframe> <figcaption>Ta-Nehisi Coates speaks with the Atlantic about writing the forthcoming Black Panther series</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coates said in the Atlantic that comics were his “earliest influences”, and that when he was contacted about continuing the Black Panther series: “I was less concerned with character conflict than with the realisation of my dreams as a nine-year-old.</p> <p>“Some of the best days of my life were spent poring over the back issues of The Uncanny X-Men and The Amazing Spider-Man. As a child of the crack-riddled west Baltimore of the 1980s, I found the tales of comic books to be an escape, another reality where, very often, the weak and mocked could transform their fallibility into fantastic power,” wrote the author.</p> <p>“Chris Claremont’s The Uncanny X-\u001EMen wasn’t just about an ultracool band of rebels. That series sought to grapple with the role of minorities in society – both the inner power and the outward persecution that come with that status. And so it is, I hope, with Black Panther. The questions are what motivate the action. The questions, ultimately, are more necessary than the answers.”</p> <p>The character will also be appearing in the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/\">Captain America: Civil War film</a> this year, played by Chadwick Boseman, as well as in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/28/marvel-black-panther-doctor-strange-avengers-movies-schedule\">forthcoming Black

aunty’s eyes. When Clara is attacked by a cat she doesn’t think it will be the start of her new life. The next day Clara starts to feel sick but instead of taking her to the doctor, her mum takes her to her aunty’s house. It is far out in a untouched place. They stay over night and she is told that she is very special. Clara thinks they’re all mad.</p> <p><br />Clara goes back home and, while riding with her friend, strange things happen. The next day her mother drops her off at her aunty’s and says she must stay for a while. She is too scared to object. Will she be able to survive when her life could change rapidly? She now knows she is a wildwitch and a good thing too because an evil force is lurking right round the corner. And what about that pesky cat? Will he be a part of this amazing story too?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d97358e0fe126711b3704065984fc63827caf762\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d97358e0fe126711b3704065984fc63827caf762/0_0_310_475/310.jpg\" alt=\"Wildwitch- Wildfire\" width=\"310\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I really love this addictive book because of its simplicity. I can’t believe so much happened and I loved how the story flowed. The way it was told and the characters just made the book that much better. I love Clara because she is amazingly brave even though she must save the wildwitches. This was a very easy read and within about a week I had read 10 chapters! The whole book puts on an amazing show and is never dull. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with the hope that you will enjoy it as much as I have. </p> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/366164/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>bunkbedbobby:</strong> ‘I loved how the story flowed’","headline":"Wildwitch: Wildfire by Lene Kaaberbøl -

I devoured the world, through art, politics, literature, films and music, in order to find the elixir of its tone. Then it became a perpetual story into which flowed the great seas of African dreams, myths and fables of the world, known and unknown. I made up stories in the matrix of the ancestral mode. Many people read these stories and assume they belong to the oral tradition, but I had always believed that it is an artist’s function to enrich the oral tradition with stories of our own, inventions of our own, inspired by the tales we heard in the moonlight, sitting in a circle. But even in that the tone is the thing.<br /></p> <p>But it was as a child that I began the book, with innocence and simplicity of heart. With the rich history of literature turning in my mind, I would disappear into the writing of the novel as into a dream. It was as if I sensed there was a book there, in the archetypal margins of the numinous world that existed already in the spirit realm; my task was to bring it here, as one lowering intact a perfect vision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/26/hubert-essakow-terra-review-ben-okri-poem-dance\">Hubert Essakow: Terra review – new Ben Okri poem accompanies earthy dance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novel was written to give myself reasons to live. Often the wonder of living fades from us, obscured by a thousand things. I wanted to look at life afresh and anew and I sought a story that would give me the right vantage point.</p> <p>It is also meant to be a humorous book – from the perspective of the spirits, the deeds and furies of men are tinged with absurdity. Poverty compelled me to break off writing the novel in order to shape another, different book which would help keep me alive. This was a book of short stories and it forced compression on me. The stories my mother told me were elliptical and strange, and the philosophies of my father, steeped in the ancient African world that was older and stranger than the Greek myths, hovered above me in the little room where I wrote. There was a lake I walked round every day, in a ritual that magnetised my spirit.</p> <p>The novel was drawn from a half-glimpsed world, and it was fading fast from reality. In that sense the novel is a sort of elegy. Not the things we saw, but the things in between – the myths in between, the tone in between – were the key to its mysteries.</p> <p>Time, which decays everything else, gives literature a strange new life. As we diminish in time, works of literature grow. I hope that time has been kind to The Famished Road.</p> <ul> <li>This is an edited extract of the introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of The Famished Road</li> </ul> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>IN THE BEGINNING there was a river. The river became a road and the road branched out to the whole world. And because the road was once a river it was always hungry.</p> <p>In that land of beginnings spirits mingled with the unborn.</p> <p>We could assume numerous forms. Many of us were birds. We knew no boundaries. There was much feasting, playing, and sorrowing. We feasted much because of the beautiful terrors of eternity. We played much because we were free. And we sorrowed much because there were always those amongst us who had just returned from the world of the Living. They had returned inconsolable for all the love they had left behind, all the suffering they hadn’t redeemed, all that they hadn’t understood, and for all that they had barely begun to learn before they were drawn back to the land of origins.</p> <p>There was not one amongst us who looked forward to being born. We disliked the rigours of existence, the unful­filled longings, the enshrined injustices of the world, the labyrinths of love, the ignorance of parents, the fact of dying, and the amazing indifference of the Living in the midst of the simple beauties of the universe. We feared the heart­lessness of human beings, all of whom are born blind, few of whom ever learn to see.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5bf459c6c3187360f43cb0b72515ae0df8b486a8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5bf459c6c3187360f43cb0b72515ae0df8b486a8/0_0_795_964/412.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian’s review of The Famished Road, from 21 March 1991\" width=\"412\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian’s review of The Famished Road, from 21 March 1991.

Sometimes fantasy widens the dimensions of the novel, but often it is overplayed. At various points, it flows from one scene to the next like a surreal watercolour left in the bath, and as the archetypes pile upon one another, one begins to wonder if the novel doesn’t require a dream-analyst more than a literary critic. This is all straining to convey the pregnant madness of vast Africa, where anything may occur, but to my mind it is not the ‘unreality’ but the reality of Africa that is so very moving in The Famished Road, and quite mad, desperate and illogical enough to satisfy any appetite. – <strong>Glyn Hughes</strong><br /></p> </blockquote> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>A 25th-anniversary edition of The Famished

I may be long past my university days, but I am still a sucker for this kind of question","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>There were times when I asked myself why I was reading this collection of essays on modernist literature spanning three decades, and why, moreover, I was recommending it to you, oh gentle and blameless reader. What grudge do I have against you, or what atonement do I think I am performing, when I run up against a sentence like the following? “The preconditions for the autonomy of the aesthetic totality can be formulated in a different way, in terms of the problem of reference.” And I should add that this is one of Professor Jameson’s shorter sentences. The next one is four times as long and mentions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/16/biography.philosophy\" title=\"\">Hegel</a>, and whenever I run across that name I feel like tiptoeing off to the drinks cabinet and pouring myself a stiff one.</p> <p>But, but. The sentence I quote comes from a chapter called “Proust or Joyce?” and I must confess that I am a sucker for that kind of question. I may be long past my university days, which was the last time I might have been expected to consider such a question, but when I see a book that asks it – or, as in another chapter, whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charles-baudelaire\" title=\"\">Baudelaire</a> was a modernist, and if so what kind; or which tantalisingly offers the prospect of getting a handle on Wallace Stevens’s beautifully baffling verse – then I am drawn to it, as the moth to the light bulb. And if I batter myself senselessly against it with at times as little comprehension as the moth has of the concept of electricity, then I will at least have had the benefit of some light.</p> <p>Jameson has been publishing since 1961, and has now written so many books that you may have picked one up yourself. A Marxist thinker who throws out terms like “dialectical” a lot, he nevertheless is capable of letting the mask slip and producing something that is readable, and at times charmingly so. For example, on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/aug/24/art\" title=\"\">De Kooning</a> (like many literary critics, Jameson is very good on art; there’s a playfulness at work when the literary sensibility bumps into the image, like a bring-your-toys-to-school day): “What I like to look at in De Kooning’s paintings is the yellow. I like to look at the yellow parts of even those paintings I don’t think much of. Next to the yellow, I like to look at the pink. Finally the grey.” Was there ever a more winning introduction to a serious essay on aesthetics? And it leads, by plausible and convincing steps, to this conclusion: “Photorealism is thus the aesthetic ideology and the fullest living expression of that sterile thing which is consumer capitalism or the s<em>ocieté de consommation</em>.” (Note the teasing opposition of “fullest living expression” and “sterile thing”; almost, but not quite, completely contradictory.)</p> <p>The large part of Jameson’s career has involved explaining the “catastrophe” of postmodernism, and not only does anyone who uses such a word to describe PoMo make me prick up my ears, it also means that they are going to engage with what came before the “post”: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/marcelproust\" title=\"\">Proust</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce\" title=\"\">Joyce</a>, Stevens, James and Mallarmé, to mention just some of the writers dealt with here. And if he has the cheek to name “the two most boring chapters in <em>Ulysses</em>”, he also has the grace to make the case for them. Quoting the penultimate chapter of Joyce’s novel, he says he actually “tend[s] rather to prefer this one” to Molly Bloom’s monologue. (So do I.)</p> <p>Effort is rewarding in itself, and there are tougher challenges than reading Jameson. “As I read those three thousand pages …” he says, referring to Sartre’s unfinished magnum opus on Flaubert, and overhead passes a nightmare that has not settled upon us. He has read those three thousand pages so we don’t have to.</p> <p>• To order <em>The Modernist Papers</em> for £14.99 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/373179/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Well, here’s some: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/tessa-hadley\">Tessa Hadley</a>, the British writer, has won a <a href=\"http://windhamcampbell.org/winners\">Windham-Campbell prize </a>(established three years ago, the awards support the work of nine writers each year with a grant worth $150,000).</p> <p>I couldn’t be happier for her. She deserves all the prizes. Hadley is psychologically acute, drily witty and, whether describing a red-brick suburb or a sopping country afternoon, she is absolutely wonderful on place. Her relative obscurity, then, is an unfathomable mystery, even if I know deep down she is likely just another victim of a literary culture that tends to prize the male over the female, the grandly thematic over the so-called domestic. The female characters at the heart of her novels – clever, impulsive, not always wholly likable – are so finely drawn, I can never get them out of my head. Even now, whenever I see a train bound for Cardiff, I picture Kate, the heroine of her third novel, <em>The Master Bedroom</em>. What is she doing these days, I think to myself. Is she sleeping with yet another unsuitable man?</p> <p>If you haven’t read Hadley before, where should you start? My favourite book of hers is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/clever-girl.html\"><em>Clever Girl</em></a>, from 2013, which tells the story of Stella in 10 seemingly self-contained chapters from her childhood in the 1960s through to her married middle age. It’s a remarkable novel, not least for the seamless way Hadley handles the passage of time, though its chief bit of daring for me is its expression of what cleverness feels like, and the impact this may have on the trajectory of an ordinary woman’s life. It should enrich, and mostly it does, but it also increases the chances that she will feel patronised or, even worse, thwarted.</p> <p>Stella struggles with life. Things often go wrong for her. Yet somehow, she is always heading towards the light. I remember that I found this almost unbearably moving; I read the novel’s last 30 pages with tears rolling down my cheeks, a rare thing for me. And when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/06/tessa-hadley-meet-the-author-the-past\">I interviewed Hadley</a> last summer, before the publication of her latest novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/323074/s/the-past/\"><em>The Past</em></a>, I was ambushed by the memory of it. As her creator looked on kindly, I struggled to compose myself, Stella having suddenly crept, quite uninvited, into her sun-filled sitting room.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hazm","wordcount":"390","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/442d5509026b332b116da31ba0a2cba8fa630df2/0_62_5616_3371/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-03T10:20:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Few

and love and magic, and IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!’</p>","body":"<p>When I first looked at the cover of Rebel of the Sands, I knew that it was a book I had to have. I didn’t care what it was about, this was cover love at first sight. My love only deepened when I actually read what the book was about: ‘A Sharpshooter. A Dreamer. A damn good liar’ and I had chills running down my back! </p> <p>To be quite honest, I don’t think my words can quite capture the essence of what this book has in store for you when you pick it up (because you REALLY should) so I’m going to try and capture it from some of the many lines that were so awesome, I re-read them over and over. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f1d545dd89447ced61c73e5e8f513c7759f8b4a7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f1d545dd89447ced61c73e5e8f513c7759f8b4a7/0_0_314_475/314.jpg\" alt=\"Rebel of the Sands\" width=\"314\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn’t seem to mind proving myself dumb if it meant proving someone else wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>You know badass heroines, right? We all love them. There’s Katniss Everdeen and Celaena Sardothien and Mare Barrow. Here’s the thing though, how many of said actually SAID they were badass, because Amani does. And Amani is AWESOME! She’s a fearless dreamer with perfect aim and a will to live, and I assure you, you will LOVE her.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No one could see me, a girl with a stolen gun, shooting until my fingers were sore and my aim was good enough that I could’ve knocked a shot glass out of a drunk’s shaky fingers. </p> </blockquote> <p>The book opens with Amani trying to get out of the bleak existence she can’t help but detest. She’s meant for greater things; she’s meant for places where your gender doesn’t make you lose respect, where it’s okay to not be ashamed to have been born a girl. AND I loved that in the middle of an Arabian Night’s story, we had FEMINISM, and equality and non-discrimination. These were real life issues that every girl in the world faces – East or West – and Alwyn handled it all brilliantly. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was a desert girl. I thought I knew heat. </p> <p>I was wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, a book is NOT complete without the smouldering boy who gets our heroine completely, and in most novels, she just falls right into his arms without much thought and he does almost all of the work. SO NOT THE CASE! Amani, even if she was wrong, wasn’t afraid of doing what she needed to get what she wanted. And the CHEMISTRY! *Swoons* *Finds Ointment for Burns* </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These ideas could make men shout for rebellion even when it meant they would hang for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>The blurb promises you rebellion and love and magic, and IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! From the stories of Djinn to Ghouls to Skinwalkers, to the passion between Jin and Amani and through all the characters with their dangerous powers and powerful personalities, this book will grip you and never let go. <br /> <br />I guess I just need to end with: ‘Red Queen meets The Hunger Games in this masterful Arabian Nights setting, leaving readers spellbound.’</p> <p><strong>• Buy this book

seriously, it is a mystery to me. I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"715","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45xtn","wordcount":"3166","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608387704/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you.

great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"439","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1024","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This
