Brotherhood calls protests as judge accused of acting out of spite after two-day trial over policeman's death in Minya","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:20:48Z","body":"<p>Fears for the integrity of Egypt's legal system deepened on Monday after 529 supporters of the ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi were sentenced to death for the murder of a single policeman, in a mass trial that lasted less than two days.</p><p>Lawyers and analysts said the sentences were likely to be commuted on appeal. But their scale and the brisk way they were enforced heightened concern for Egypt's rule of law <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution\" title=\"\">amid a crackdown on political opposition</a>. At least 16,000 mainly Islamist dissidents have been arrested since Morsi's overthrow in July.</p><p>Amnesty International described the news as \"injustice writ large\", and said it was the largest single batch of death sentences it had seen anywhere in the world in recent memory.</p><p>The sentences are likely to spark yet more unrest, with Egyptians from both secular and Islamist backgrounds expressing anger. Supporters of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood announced large-scale protests to begin immediately and continue  on Tuesday.</p><p>Sixteen defendants were acquitted after lawyers said they had not been allowed to present a proper defence during either the trial's first hearing, on Saturday, or the second and final session on Monday.</p><p>Ahmed Shabeeb, a lawyer for the men sentenced to death, said: \"This is a disturbing verdict that infringed all laws, regulations, as well as the 2014 constitution.\"</p><p>Shabeeb claimed that the judge, Saeed Elgazar, sentenced the men out of spite after being told during Saturday's 45-minute-long session that his behaviour was unconstitutional.</p><p>\"Don't talk about the constitution, I don't want to hear about that in my court,\" Elgazar had said, according to Shabeeb. The judge's outburst reportedly started a fierce argument that he tried to resolve by calling armed security officials to guard the judicial bench, Shabeeb added.</p><p>\"He swore he'd give a verdict at the next session on Monday, and that is what happened,\" Shabeeb said. \"It is a reckless verdict that was borne from anger.\"</p><p>The defendants were sentenced in Minya, a southern city that was hardest hit by a spasm of anti-state and sectarian violence that erupted across Egypt last August. Mobs thought to be sympathetic to Morsi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/egyptian-police-recapture-islamist-town-delga\" title=\"\">attacked dozens of churches</a> and police stations in revenge for the state's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/cairo-doctors-morsi-hospitals\" title=\"\">brutal clearance of a pro-Morsi protest camp</a> in Cairo.</p><p>A deputy police commander, Mostafa el-Attar, was killed in the Minya violence, and it was for his murder and the attempted murder of two others that the 529 were sentenced to hang.</p><p>Families of the accused and rights lawyers described the process as a miscarriage of justice. \"Nothing can describe this scandal. This is not a judicial sentence, this is thuggery,\" said Waleed, whose father was among those condemned, and who asked not to publish his surname.</p><p>He said Monday'ssession lasted five minutes. \"And during those five minutes none of the lawyers or the defendants were listened to, not even the prosecution. The judge just came in to acquit [the 16] and sentence to death the others,\" he said.</p><p>Mohamed Zaree, head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, said: \"This verdict is a disaster. To rule in the second session of a trial – it means the judge didn't hear the defence or look at the evidence. Even someone from the second grade of the law faculty would never have issued this verdict, it goes against the basic principles of criminology.\"</p><p>Many compared the sentences unfavourably to the 10-year jail term given last week to a police captain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/cairo-prison-abu-zabaal-deaths-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">who was found culpable for the gassing to death of 37 prisoners</a> last August.</p><p>The death sentences are the latest instalment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">campaign of repression</a> that has seen over a thousand in which more than 1,000 dissidents have been killed, thousands more have been arrested, and journalists have been jailed for advocating or reporting narratives that oppose the post-Morsi state.</p><p>But Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University and an expert on the Egyptian judiciary, said the verdict was highly unlikely to have been directly ordered by a central figure such as Egypt's army chief, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p><p>\"Parts of the judicial apparatus are fully on board with the new repressive order, at least for now,\" said Brown. \"Many felt that they were under attack by the Morsi presidency and they have rallied around what might be called the 'party of order' represented by the military, the security apparatus, and the top of the religious establishment.</p><p>\"I think it is more a matter of a common mentality than direct co-ordination. Indeed, the court here has gone so far that it is difficult to see that it serves the interest of the regime.\"</p><p>Egypt's foreign ministry was at pains to emphasise the conditional nature of the sentences, hinting at embarrassment at Monday's events. \"The law allows the verdict to be appealed,\" its statement read, in red type that was emboldened and underlined.

It was not immediately clear how many sentences had been confirmed, with the lawyers giving estimates ranging from 182 to 197. In either case, it would be largest mass death sentence to be confirmed in Egypt in recent memory.</p><p>Lawyers boycotted the opening of the trial on 25 March to protest an earlier mass death sentence by Judge Said Youssef. A month after that session, the judge sentenced 683 people to death, including Badie. Of the 683, all but 110 were tried in absentia, according to defence lawyer Khaled el-Komi.</p><p>Death sentences issued for those in absentia are automatically cancelled in Egypt if they turn themselves in or are apprehended, and a retrial is ordered.</p><p>The case springs from an attack on a police station in the town of Adwa near the southern city of Minya on 14 August in which one policeman and one civilian were killed. The attack was carried out in retaliation after police killed hundreds while dispersing a sprawling Cairo sit-in by Morsi supporters.</p><p>The death sentences sparked international condemnation and raised questions about the independence of the judiciary.</p><p>Mohammed Tosson, a representative of the defence team, said that 183 people were sentenced to death, four received life sentences and 496 were acquitted.

But history shows that such measures have a habit of becoming permanent","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T11:30:48Z","body":"<p>Egypt's muddled transition from dictatorship to democracy has entered a dangerous phase with the president and his Islamist supporters arrayed against the rest – each side claiming to be the true defender of democracy and the revolution. President Morsi says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/22/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">his controversial decree</a> (euphemistically called \"constitutional declaration\") is only a provisional measure to defend the revolution and ensure a swift passage to democracy. And a presidential spokesman has now said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/26/mohamed-morsi-decree-sovereign-matters\" title=\"\">only decisions related to \"sovereign matters\"</a> will be protected from judicial review. He may be sincere. But exceptional temporary measures in Egypt have a history of becoming permanent.</p><p>Back in 1954, Colonel Nasser, the leader of the military coup that overthrew the monarchy, abolished all political parties in order to fight the \"reactionary forces\" of the ancient regime. To this day, Egypt is still struggling to extricate itself from his legacy of an all-powerful president who rules by decrees with the help of a secret police.</p><p>Back then, the judiciary, like today, played a crucial role. The midwives of Nasser's dictatorship were some of Egypt's finest legal minds who had lost faith in the old ruling elite. Political expediency superseded lofty legal and constitutional principles, and justice itself became the first victim of revolutionary justice.</p><p>Today the judiciary is divided between those who support Morsi's swift justice, and those who say they are fighting for the rule of law and independence of the judiciary. The problem is that some of the latter, especially the leadership of the Judges Club, have for years been loyal servants of Mubarak and never stood up to him.</p><p>Morsi and his supporters may be right in suspecting that old regime stalwarts within the administration are trying to thwart a transition to democracy. But they are equally guilty of pursuing a narrow Islamist agenda. The decision to protect the controversial constituent assembly – packed with Islamists and their supporters – from any legal challenge, seems to provide evidence for that. The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies feel they are entitled to draft a constitution to their liking, ignoring many well-founded legal and political arguments that such an important document should not be written by the winners of an election, but by representatives of a broad spectrum of Egyptian society.</p><p>The constitutional court is due to issue its verdict on the legality of the assembly next month, and it was widely expected to dissolve the panel drafting the new constitution because many of its members were drawn from a parliament which had been dissolved. This would have been the second time the constituent assembly was dissolved because of disputes over the criteria of selecting its members.</p><p>Who is to blame for this mess? A muddled roadmap for transition was laid down by the military council which ruled Egypt after the overthrow of Mubarak in February 2011. Instead of starting by laying down new rules for the game by drafting the constitution first, they rushed to a parliamentary election based on a faulty electoral law. The law was subsequently challenged and the Islamist-dominated parliament was dissolved.</p><p>The Muslim Brotherhood also bears part of the blame, because it supported that roadmap, thinking it would enable the Brotherhood to take power quickly. Things didn't turn out that way. And when existing laws stood in its way, it decided to change the rules to its advantage.</p><p>The scene is now set for a mighty confrontation as more and more judges and politicians line up against Morsi and his party. In fact, Morsi has succeeded in something no one else has: unifying the fractious liberal and leftist groups.</p><p>But failure to reach a compromise could plunge Egypt further into political chaos and paralyse the machinery of the state. The judges have said they will go on strike to bring the legal system to a halt until Morsi backs down. With both sides sending their supporters to the streets, the fear is that it could turn very nasty, though optimists believe Egypt has always pulled back from the brink. Let's hope they are right.</p><p>Egypt's muddled transition is proving to be a steep learning curve, if not a precipice. The current fear of impending chaos has once again raised the spectre of \"the saviour leader\". Old regime supporters as well as conservative forces within the army and the security establishment believe Egypt is not ready for democracy and can only be ruled by an iron fist. They are watching with glee as political crises unfold in quick succession. They are now praying for a strong man to emerge from the shadows to prevent a descent into anarchy.</p>","headline":"Mohamed Morsi and the fight for Egypt","trailText":"<strong>Magdi Abdelhadi: </strong>President Morsi says his power grab is temporary.

Mohamed ElBaradei called it a violation of universal values and vowed that the struggle against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood would continue.</p><p>Earlier, an estimated 50,000 people congregated near Cairo University, many bussed in from the countryside to show their support for the president and sharia law. Members of the president's Muslim Brotherhood were joined by large numbers of their Salfi Muslim allies.</p><p>\"I'm here to support Morsi's decree and the constitution. He is the first elected president, and his decisions are all correct,\" said protester Shaaban Hassan. Fellow protester Mustafa Abdel-Razak stressed that it was a religious duty to support Morsi. \"It's a matter of religion, to support my custodian [Morsi]. It is religiously decreed to support my custodian, as long as he does not order us to sin.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Egypt's top court postponed a session during which it was expected to rule on the legitimacy of the panel that drafted the constitution. </p><p>The officials cited \"administrative reasons\" for the delay, but the announcement came as several thousand Morsi supporters surrounded the supreme constitutional court, preventing members of the judiciary from entering the courthouse in Cairo.</p><p>Morsi's decree and the resulting furore has repolarised Egyptian politics and society. Opposition forces immediately took to the streets to decry what they termed a dictatorial power grab, which granted Morsi judicial immunity in all decisions and ringfenced the assembly given the task of drafting the constitution.</p><p>Morsi has insisted that the measures are temporary and will speed Egypt's democratic transition.</p><p>However, by giving himself extensive powers and putting his decisions beyond judicial challenge he has pushed the country into fresh turmoil. His assertion of authority in a decree issued the day after he won world praise for brokering a Gaza truce between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement dismayed his opponents.</p><p>Saturday was the first showing of Islamist forces since the uproar began after they cancelled a demonstration last Tuesday because it coincided with opposition forces marching on Tahrir Square. Initially Saturday's protest was scheduled for Tahrir Square, but was relocated to Cairo University to avoid opposition protesters who were continuing a sit-in.</p><p>In an effort to defuse the crisis, and also avoid possible dissolution by the supreme court on Sunday, the drafting assembly rushed to finish in time for Morsi to ratify it and call the referendum. </p><p>The final draft drew criticism at home and abroad for its ambiguous language, its weak and contradictory articles on human rights, women's rights and civil liberties, and for the creeping sense of religiosity. The assembly was also criticised for its homogeneous nature after liberal and Christian members withdrew.</p><p>\"We fundamentally reject the referendum and constituent assembly because the assembly does not represent all sections of society,\" said Sayed el-Erian, 43, a protester and member of a party set up by ElBaradei.</p><p>Privately owned media announced a press blackout on Tuesday and Wednesday in protest. Morsi's unilateral actions and refusal to back down have dismayed secular opposition forces, who are adamant that he must rescind these powers  before a solution can be discussed.</p><p>\"Morsi's actions display a lack of wisdom,\" said university professor Mustafa Kamel el-Sayed, who withdrew from the assembly drafting the constitution because of the Islamist domination of the group.</p><p>\"The head of state should try to promote national reconciliation. And by insisting on a course of action which is rejected by a considerable number of Egyptians, the president is basing his power exclusively on one political force, marginalising all others.\"</p><p>However, Sayed Sabah Abdallah, a member of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice party, who was present at the pro-Morsi rally, laid the blame of the current crisis squarely at the door of the secular opposition.</p><p>\"The forces in Tahrir want to bring down this constitution because they know we are the biggest organisational force in the country and that we would sweep the parliamentary elections that must be held right after the constitution is passed in the referendum,\" he said.</p>","headline":"Egypt: Mohamed Morsi calls December referendum on

</video><p>Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi plans to reject the authority of a court due to try him on Monday, in what could be his first public appearance since being deposed and hidden in a secret location in July.</p><p>The trial is expected to increase Egypt's political tensions, with Morsi supporters planning a series of nationwide protests and police announcing a state of alert. Security fears are so high that on Sunday court officials had not yet confirmed whether the trial would be televised, or even whether the ex-president would be allowed to attend in person.</p><p>Morsi stands accused of inciting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/egypt-clashes-protesters-muslim-supporters\" title=\"\">the murder of protesters demonstrating outside Cairo's presidential palace last December</a>, charges also faced by 14 other senior officials from the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Morsi, who still regards himself as Egypt's legal president, plans to defend himself because he believes engaging a lawyer would be an indirect acknowledgment of the court's authority.</p><p>\"Neither us nor President Morsi acknowledges the legitimacy of this trial,\" said Amr Darrag, a cabinet minister during Morsi's year in office, speaking on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice party.</p><p>Morsi's trial is likely to spark renewed unrest. A spokesman for the anti-coup alliance – a coalition of Morsi backers from the Brotherhood and its allies – has promised to \"make this day an international day of protest. We will defeat this brutal traitorous military coup.\"</p><p>More than 1,000 pro-Morsi supporters and dozens of security officials have died during confrontations at protests since Morsi's 3 July overthrow. Terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/egyptian-interior-minister-survives-car-bomb\" title=\"\">have also risen</a>.</p><p>Fears that Morsi's re-emergence might reinvigorate his supporters have led Egypt's authorities to keep quiet about the precise arrangements for his trial. While it is likely to take place at a police compound on the eastern outskirts of Cairo, this has not been officially confirmed. An official at the prosecutors' office told the Guardian it had not yet been decided whether the trial would be televised orwhether Morsi would be allowed to attend, out of fear for public order.</p><p>In news that may exacerbate tensions further, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, arrived in Egypt on Sunday – the first time a US secretary of state has travelled to Egypt on what is known as an unannounced visit for security reasons.</p><p>A US official said Kerry's visit was entirely unrelated to Morsi's trial, but his presence could anger both Morsi supporters and his critics, who each accuse the US of meddling in Egyptian affairs and of siding with their opponents.</p><p>The US has never described Morsi's overthrow as a coup, but last month Washington cut the amount of aid it gives to Egypt. The unannounced nature of Kerry's arrival suggests he is keen to keep a low profile.</p><p>For the first time in its history, Egypt will have two ex-presidents on trial at the same time, with Morsi following his predecessor Hosni Mubarak into the dock. But whereas Mubarak's first trial (he is currently being retried) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2011/aug/03/egypt-syria-libya-middle-east-unrest\" title=\"\">was greeted eagerly by most Egyptians</a>, Morsi's prosecution has provoked mixed emotions.</p><p>\"A lot of Egyptians feel pity for Morsi, even people who like Sisi [the army chief, General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi],\" argued Ahmed Shabani, a 30-year-old doctor who took part in anti-Morsi protests this June, and who was also involved in the December demonstrations against Morsi that led to this trial.</p><p>\"We know he was just a pawn for the Brotherhood, an engineering professor who became the president,\" Shabani added. \"And now he's probably going to be sentenced to life.\"</p><p>In some quarters, the case is seen as a trial of the Brotherhood rather than just Morsi himself, said HA Hellyer, a Cairo-based analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a foreign affairs thinktank.</p><p>\"When Mubarak was in court, it was the prosecution of a president who'd been around for 30 years, and those who were very vigorously in support of the trial really wanted a death sentence,\" said Hellyer. \"But with Morsi, it feels more like it's the Brotherhood on trial, rather than Morsi as an individual. I get the impression that as long as the Brotherhood get stamped out, it wouldn't go down so badly. I don't think they're looking for Morsi's blood.\"</p><p>Morsi and his co-defendants are accused of ordering hundreds of Brotherhood cadres on 5 December 2012 to attack secular protesters camped outside his presidential palace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/morsi-power-grab-angers-opposition\" title=\"\">demanding the abandonment of a constitution drafted by Morsi's allies</a>. The confrontation sparked night-long clashes that left at least 10 dead, and began a spiral of political upheaval that led the army to overthrow Morsi this July, following days of mass protests.</p><p>\"It was a turning point in Egyptian history,\" said Shabani, the Morsi critic, of the December clashes. \"For the first time two groups of people directly faced each other on the basis of their political beliefs. It was a civil war – a small one, just on one street. But ever since everything went violent.\"</p><p>Morsi was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/morsi-final-days-egypt-president\" title=\"\">arrested along with several of his aides on 3 July</a>, and has since been held virtually incommunicado in at least three government compounds. Beyond a visit from EU foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, and two phonecalls with his family, his jailers have limited Morsi's contact with the outside world – treatment his supporters say is extrajudicial and does not bode well for a fair procedure in the courtroom.</p><p>\"There is no evidence in Morsi's 4 November trial,\" Morsi's legal adviser, Mohamed el-Damaty, told Egypt's flagship state newspaper, al-Ahram.</p><p>But Egypt's new interim government says his treatment and his prosecution are legitimate. \"He will have full rights to a free and fair trial,\" said Badr Abdellaty, a spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry. \"He will be charged on criminal charges before his normal judge according to the Egyptian penal code. Nothing extraordinary. Nothing exceptional.\"</p><p>Whatever else happens, Morsi's prosecution is unlikely to be speedy. Mubarak's trial was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/13/hosni-mubarak-retrial-egypt\" title=\"\">subject to frequent administrative delays and postponements</a>. \"If it's anything like Mubarak's trial, this session may start and finish within about five minutes,\" said Hellyer. \"It could be the start of a very drawn-out process.\"</p>","headline":"Egypt on high alert as Mohamed Morsi trial threatens to revive civil unrest","trailText":"John Kerry flies in for surprise visit day before ex-president is due to be tried for inciting murder of opposition demonstrators","newspaperPageNumber":"16","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/3/1383477875742/US-secretary-of-state-Joh-004.jpg","wordcount":"998","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"421551680","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8275372","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1991067","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-11-06T11:25:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/egypt-high-alert-mohamed-morsi-trial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/03/egypt-high-alert-mohamed-morsi-trial","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/mohamed-morsi","webTitle":"Mohamed Morsi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/mohamed-morsi","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

Earlier reports on Saturday said the death toll had exceeded 136.</p><p>The Egyptian health ministry said that it had counted 38 dead – though its figures are only based on bodies delivered to state institutions. </p><p>The massacre took place in the small hours of Saturday morning, at a sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya, east Cairo, where tens of thousands of pro-Morsi supporters have camped since Morsi was deposed on 3 July. </p><p>Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad said the shooting started shortly before pre-dawn morning prayers on the fringes of a round-the-clock vigil being staged by backers of Morsi, who was toppled by the army more than three weeks ago. </p><p>\"They are not shooting to wound, they are shooting to kill,\" Haddad said, adding that the death toll might be much higher. </p><p>Al Jazeera's Egypt television station reported that 120 had been killed and some 4,500 injured in the early morning violence near Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawia mosque. </p><p>Reporters at the scene said firing could still be heard hours after the troubles started. </p><p>\"I have been trying to make the youth withdraw for five hours.

other in Tahrir Square, Egypt's revolutionary epicentre.</p><p>The clashes went on for hours, after tensions were inflamed by both sides aiming barbed chants at each other. Protesters sympathetic to leftwing and liberal political forces were kicked out of the square after their anti-Morsi chants, only to return in greater numbers. Violence flared when Morsi supporters barred their path in the roads leading to Tahrir.</p><p>One man, Ibrahim El-Sheikhh, who was wounded in a beating from Morsi supporters, told the Guardian: \"They trapped us from both sides after attacking our stage where we were chanting. As they beat me they chanted <em>Allahu Akbar</em> [God is Great] and said they'd kidnap me, but I managed to escape. This is the Muslim Brotherhood.\"</p><p>The original protest had been organised by secular political forces ostensibly to protest against the monopolisation of the drafting of Egypt's new constitution by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups.

Morsi supporters also protested the acquittals.</p><p>In response, the president attempted to remove the country's general prosecutor, the Mubarak appointee Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud, by appointing him ambassador to the Vatican.

the verge of the Egyptian presidency, but a standoff between the expected election winners and the country's military authority  appears inevitable.</p><p>The Muslim Brotherhood held a press conference at 4am Cairo time, saying its candidate had beaten his rival, Ahmed Shafiq, Hosni Mubarak's last appointed premier, by almost 1 million votes.</p><p>With 99% of the votes tabulated, the Brotherhood claimed Morsi had garnered 13.2m votes – 51.8% – against 12.3m for Shafiq. Initial results contain a margin of error of about two percentage points, meaning the result may be premature. However, the confidence with which the group claimed its victory was palpable.</p><p>The electoral commission is due to announce the official results on Thursday, and the Shafiq campaign has strenuously contested the Brotherhood's figures. Until the official announcement, candidates can appeal to strike a number of votes over reported violations. After the first round, though, the commission dismissed all candidates' appeals.</p><p>Morsi made an appearance at a press conference shortly after the Brotherhood claimed victory, and gave a speech promising to be president of all Egyptians, not just those who voted for him. \"I will be serving all Egyptians, and standing at an equal distance from all of them.\"</p><p>Chants of \"God is great\" and \"down with military rule\" rang out at the press conference and delirious Brotherhood supporters spilled out into the streets to celebrate. Their headquarters is across the road from the ministry of the interior, which once housed many of them behind its high walls.</p><p>If the results are confirmed,  Egypt faces a standoff between the Brotherhood and the ruling military junta, which has been making an 11th-hour bid to seize back constitutional powers.</p><p>Only hours before the numbers started rolling in, the supreme council of the armed forces (Scaf) issued constitutional amendments that gave it sweeping powers and limited a future president's executive authority. Scaf  enjoys legislative authority, the power to draft the constitution, extraordinary powers of arrest and almost complete control over its own affairs and the final say on going to war.</p><p>This is being described as the final act to complete a military coup, and prompted the prominent human rights lawyer Gamal Eid to say: \"Whoever accepts the military coup and the rule of the tanks is complicit.\"</p><p>Another spanner in the Brotherhood's works was the recent decision by the supreme constitutional court to dissolve parliament, in which it was the majority bloc through its political arm, the Freedom and Justice party.</p><p>An hour later, celebrations began in Tahrir Square, the meeting point for protesters during the 18-day revolution, as the Brotherhood framed the apparent victory as a strike for the revolution, much to the chagrin of activists who believe the Brotherhood deserted the revolution months ago.</p><p>Investors seem to have  deserted Egypt in the wake of news of Morsi's lead. The market's benchmark index dropped 1.9% during  early hours of trading on Monday.</p>","headline":"Mohamed Morsi claims victory for Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt election","trailText":"<p>Standoff between Brotherhood and military junta looks likely as Mohamed Morsi claims to have beaten Ahmed Shafiq</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/18/1340018248746/Mohamed-Morsi-003.jpg","wordcount":"481","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"391793958","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6313876","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Abdel-Rahman Hussein in Cairo","internalPageCode":"1761178","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-21T11:25:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/mohamed-morsi-muslim-brotherhood-egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/18/mohamed-morsi-muslim-brotherhood-egypt","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/abdel-rahman-hussein","webTitle":"Abdel-Rahman Hussein","r2ContributorId":"49104","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/abdel-rahman-hussein","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/abdel-rahman-hussein","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/mohamed-morsi","webTitle":"Mohamed Morsi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/mohamed-morsi","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-391809392","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/18/1340018248746/Mohamed-Morsi-003.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Ahmed Gomaa","altText":"Mohamed Morsi","height":"84","credit":"Ahmed Gomaa/AP","caption":"The Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi claims victory in Egypt's presidential election runoff.

But while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">his candidacy has been an open secret</a> for months, Sisi himself had given few definitive signals of his intentions.</p><p>That finally changed on Wednesday night – three years and two months after the fall of Egypt's last ex-military strongman, Hosni Mubarak – as Egypt's military council, known as Scaf, convened to allow Sisi to resign. Minutes afterwards, shortly before 9:30pm local time, state television broadcast a 13-minute statement recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>\"If I am granted the honour of the leadership,\" Sisi said, \"I promise that we together – leadership and people – can achieve stability, safety and hope for Egypt.\"</p><p>In speech that contained few surprises, the outgoing field marshal warned Egyptians that the country faced a host of economic and political challenges, and asked them for their patience and help in rebuilding the state. He focused on strengthening state institutions and increasing stability – mentioning democracy just once, and with no mention of human rights.</p><p>Sisi is widely expected to win any presidential election by a landslide, as many see him as the only candidate with the authority to control a country wracked by three years of post-revolutionary turmoil. He has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large and often sycophantic following</a>, ranging from wealthy businessmen – who have paid for his face to be displayed on vast hoardings across Cairo – to working-class shopkeepers, who place his photograph in shop windows. To many, Sisi represents a bulwark against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, who are instinctively blamed for any outburst of violence.</p><p>But support for Sisi is by no means universal. Supporters of the Brotherhood detest him for leading a crackdown on dissent that has seen at least 16,000 people jailed since July, and over a thousand killed. A small group of secular liberals, who are now also victims of the state crackdown, also want the army out of politics. Thousands of students at Cairo university chanted against military rule on Wednesday afternoon, as news of Sisi's resignation began to trickle through.</p><p>In January's constitutional referendum, which was seen as a poll on Sisi himself, over 98% of those who voted said yes to the new constitution, and implicitly for the general too. But only 38.6% of the electorate took part, less than Sisi would have hoped for.</p><p>Sameh Seif Elyazal, a retired general expected to form part of Sisi's campaign, said: \"For the majority of Egyptians who were waiting anxiously for this moment, they will be very happy – but I think the Muslim Brotherhood will be very upset and angry.\"</p><p>The experience of the referendum has led rights activists to fear that the presidential elections may not be free or fair. Several campaigners against the constitution were arrested for putting up posters, leading many to fear a repeat scenario in the presidential poll.</p><p>Only one other serious candidate – a champion of workers' rights, Hamdeen Sabbahi – has declared his candidacy, and a senior army officer told the Guardian that the campaign would be without irregularities: \"[Sisi] is very happy for other people to run. It's not going to be a race without other candidates.\"</p><p>But three leading candidates from the 2012 elections have already withdrawn from this year's race, warning that the election will be a sham.</p><p>\"I won't take part in deceiving people into believing we have a democratic path when we don't,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/16/khaled-ali-announces-will-run-president-2/\" title=\"\">one of the withdrawn candidates, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh</a>, said in February.</p><p>Sisi risks his popularity plummeting once he becomes president, analysts argue, since <a href=\"http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=931530677&amp;Country=Egypt&amp;topic=Politics\" title=\"\">Egypt's economic and political challenges</a> are so intractable that they cannot be easily solved.</p><p>HA Hellyer , Egypt analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said: \"A Sisi presidency is going to face the key structural problems endemic in Egypt as [the country's head of state from 2011-2 Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein] Tantawi, Mubarak and Morsi did.

But while his candidacy has been an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">open secret for months</a>, Sisi himself gave few definitive signals of his intentions.</p><p>That appeared to change on Wednesday – three years and two months after the fall of Egypt's last ex-military strongman, Hosni Mubarak – when Egypt's main state-run news website said Sisi would resign from the army by the end of day, allowing him to run for elected office. Two senior military sources later confirmed the news to the Guardian.</p><p>\"Today we will have a meeting for SCAF [the army's governing council] – and after that he will resign,\" said one high-ranking officer. \"After that he will be a civilian, and after that he will be able to announce his campaign.\"</p><p>Sisi is widely expected to win any presidential election by a landslide, as many see him as the only candidate with the authority to control a country racked by three years of post-revolutionary turmoil. He has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large and often sycophantic following</a>, ranging from wealthy businessmen – who have paid for his face to be displayed on vast hoardings across Cairo – to working-class shopkeepers, who place his photograph in shop-windows. To many, Sisi represents a bulwark against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, who are instinctively blamed for any outburst of violence.</p><p>But support for Sisi is by no means universal. Supporters of the Brotherhood detest him for leading a crackdown on dissent that has seen at least 16,000 people jailed since July, and more than a thousand killed. A small group of secular liberals, who are now also victims of the state crackdown, also want the army out of politics. Thousands of students at Cairo University chanted against military rule on Wednesday afternoon, as news of Sisi's resignation began to trickle through.</p><p>In a referendum in January, which was seen as a poll on Sisi himself, more than 98% said yes to the new constitution. But only 38.6% of the electorate took part, fewer than Sisi would have hoped.</p><p>The experience of the referendum has led rights activists to fear that the presidential elections may not be free or fair. Several campaigners against the constitution were arrested for putting up posters, leading many to fear a repeat scenario in the presidential poll.</p><p>Only one other serious candidate – the workers' favourite Hamdeen Sabbahi – has declared his candidacy, and a senior army officer told the Guardian that the campaign would be without irregularities: \"[Sisi] is very happy for other people to run. It's not going to be a race without other candidates.\"</p><p>But three leading candidates from the 2012 elections have already withdrawn from this year's race, warning that the election will be a sham.</p><p>\"I won't take part in deceiving people into believing we have a democratic path when we don't,\" one of the withdrawn candidates, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, <a href=\"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/16/khaled-ali-announces-will-run-president-2/\" title=\"\">said in February</a>.</p><p>Sisi risks his popularity plummeting once he becomes president, analysts argue, <a href=\"http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=931530677&amp;Country=Egypt&amp;topic=Politics\" title=\"\">as Egypt's economic and political challenges</a> are so intractable that they cannot be easily solved.</p><p>HA Hellyer, Egypt analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said: \"A Sisi presidency is going to face the key structural problems endemic in Egypt as [the country's head of state from 2011 to 2012 Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein] Tantawi, Mubarak and Morsi did. He actually has a worse situation to deal with, considering the security threats, and the counterproductive efforts of the Egyptian state in facing all those problems. No one quite knows how he intends to address those problems – or even if he will try with any degree of success. Some of those answers may become more evident as his team members become clear in the short-lived presidential campaign – but no one should be optimistic in any real progress any time soon.\"</p><p>Analysts also say it remains to be seen how authoritarian a Sisi presidency will be, as it is currently unlikely that he is directly co-ordinating Egypt's crackdown on dissent. \"So the real test comes post-election,\" Michael Hanna, an analyst of Egyptian politics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> this week. \"Will a President Sisi – with the backing of the military, and with what he would consider a popular mandate – then decide he can make decisions?\"</p>","headline":"Egypt's army chief expected to resign, paving way for presidential campaign","trailText":"Abdel Fatah al-Sisi is said to be planning to step down from army on Wednesday, and is expected to win vote by landslide","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395844420717/Abdel-Fatah-al-Sisi-poste-006.jpg","wordcount":"752","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"433043878","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8847059","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","internalPageCode":"2066047","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T14:36:22Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/egypt-army-chief-resign-presidential-campaign","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/26/egypt-army-chief-resign-presidential-campaign","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

Abbas says she believes only two may be responsible for the murder of her husband","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:21:00Z","body":"<p>The wife of the policeman whose murder led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence\" title=\"\">death sentences for 529 Egyptians</a> on Monday has suggested that only two of them may be responsible for his killing.</p><p>The sentences caused global outcry on Monday after it emerged that the 529 had been convicted of the murder of officer Mostafa al-Attar last August in a case that lasted just two court sessions.</p><p>Speaking to an Egyptian news presenter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CW1kMcQULc#t=77\" title=\"\">after the case ended</a>,  Al-Attar's wife, Magda Abbas, inadvertently cast further doubt on the strength of the prosecution by saying that her joy at the sentences was tempered by the fact that the two men who killed him were still in hiding.</p><p>Al-Attar was wounded by a mob at a police station and later brought to hospital, where Abbas said two doctors killed him. \"Those who killed Mostafa are not there [in prison],\" said Abbas. \"They are fugitives.\"</p><p>Local lawyers protested against the death sentences by boycotting a second mass trial of 683 people on Tuesday, which was presided over by the same judge who ruled in the first case.</p><p>Judge Saeed Youssef Elgazar went ahead regardless – a decision defence lawyers said was illegal.</p><p>\"I have never seen anything like this in all my life as a lawyer,\" said Adel Aly, one of the defence counsel who chose not to attend Tuesday's trial of defendants including the head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie.</p><p>Ahmed Shabeeb, another lawyer involved in the boycott,  said: \"His [Elgazar's] decision infringed all the procedures guaranteed by law and the constitution – as if he wanted to say that he's the uppermost god.\"</p><p>According to local media, Elgazar has a history of controversial judgments, most prominently in January last year when he acquitted policemen accused of murdering protesters during the 2011 revolution.</p><p>Further draconian sentences were avoided as Tuesday's trial was adjourned until 28 April. But violence broke out in Minya, the southern city where both trials took place, as students clashed with police. The head of the local student union said some protesters had been hit by police shotgun pellets. Clashes were also reported in the northern city of Alexandria.</p><p>The death sentences sparked a global outcry, culminating in the UN's human rights office judging that the case had breached international law.</p><p>\"A mass trial of 529 people conducted over just two days cannot possibly have met even the most basic requirements for a fair trial,\" said the UN's human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville.</p><p>But reaction in Egypt was more mixed. The identities of the 529 are not all known, but many Egyptians assume they are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group behind the ousted president Mohamed Morsi. Many in Egypt instinctively blame the Brotherhood for all new outbursts of violence, and believe the 529 deserved their punishment.</p><p>One lawyer from the area, Ali Delgawy, said: \"They're liars, so they deserve whatever happens to them.\"</p><p>Both state and private media have consistently backed the actions of the post-Morsi regime, and Monday's trial was no exception. \"Today, we got justice, the justice that we want. We are tired of your violence. We will build the country despite your war,\" <a href=\"http://madamasr.com/content/egyptian-television-celebrates-mass-death-sentence\" title=\"\">said Rania Badawy</a>, a presenter on the private Tahrir channel.</p><p>A presenter for the Sada al-Balad channel, Ahmed Moussa, said: \"I salute the fairness and justice of our judiciary in defiance of those killers and all those who attack it. Egypt's judiciary is clean and fair.\"</p><p>Analysts argued that while the judgment may have been made independently, Egypt's judiciary was not a neutral institution. \"Parts of the judicial apparatus are fully on board with the new repressive order, at least for now,\" said Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University. But he added: \"I think it is more a matter of a common mentality than direct co-ordination.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Manu Abdo </em></p>","headline":"Egyptian policeman's wife casts doubt on death sentences handed out to 529","trailText":"<p>Magda Abbas says she believes only two may be responsible for the murder of her husband</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395758044787/Minya-003.jpg","wordcount":"621","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"432951313","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8842496","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2065258","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T14:37:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/egypt-lawyers-boycott-mass-trial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/25/egypt-lawyers-boycott-mass-trial","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

But their scale and the brisk way they were enforced heightened concern for Egypt's rule of law <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution\" title=\"\">amid a crackdown on political opposition</a>. At least 16,000 mainly Islamist dissidents have been arrested since Morsi's overthrow in July.</p><p>Amnesty International described the news as \"injustice writ large\", and said it was the largest single batch of death sentences it had seen anywhere in the world in recent memory.</p><p>The sentences are likely to spark yet more unrest, with Egyptians from both secular and Islamist backgrounds expressing anger. Supporters of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood announced large-scale protests to begin immediately and continue  on Tuesday.</p><p>Sixteen defendants were acquitted after lawyers said they had not been allowed to present a proper defence during either the trial's first hearing, on Saturday, or the second and final session on Monday.</p><p>Ahmed Shabeeb, a lawyer for the men sentenced to death, said: \"This is a disturbing verdict that infringed all laws, regulations, as well as the 2014 constitution.\"</p><p>Shabeeb claimed that the judge, Saeed Elgazar, sentenced the men out of spite after being told during Saturday's 45-minute-long session that his behaviour was unconstitutional.</p><p>\"Don't talk about the constitution, I don't want to hear about that in my court,\" Elgazar had said, according to Shabeeb. The judge's outburst reportedly started a fierce argument that he tried to resolve by calling armed security officials to guard the judicial bench, Shabeeb added.</p><p>\"He swore he'd give a verdict at the next session on Monday, and that is what happened,\" Shabeeb said. \"It is a reckless verdict that was borne from anger.\"</p><p>The defendants were sentenced in Minya, a southern city that was hardest hit by a spasm of anti-state and sectarian violence that erupted across Egypt last August. Mobs thought to be sympathetic to Morsi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/egyptian-police-recapture-islamist-town-delga\" title=\"\">attacked dozens of churches</a> and police stations in revenge for the state's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/cairo-doctors-morsi-hospitals\" title=\"\">brutal clearance of a pro-Morsi protest camp</a> in Cairo.</p><p>A deputy police commander, Mostafa el-Attar, was killed in the Minya violence, and it was for his murder and the attempted murder of two others that the 529 were sentenced to hang.</p><p>Families of the accused and rights lawyers described the process as a miscarriage of justice. \"Nothing can describe this scandal. This is not a judicial sentence, this is thuggery,\" said Waleed, whose father was among those condemned, and who asked not to publish his surname.</p><p>He said Monday'ssession lasted five minutes. \"And during those five minutes none of the lawyers or the defendants were listened to, not even the prosecution. The judge just came in to acquit [the 16] and sentence to death the others,\" he said.</p><p>Mohamed Zaree, head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, said: \"This verdict is a disaster. To rule in the second session of a trial – it means the judge didn't hear the defence or look at the evidence. Even someone from the second grade of the law faculty would never have issued this verdict, it goes against the basic principles of criminology.\"</p><p>Many compared the sentences unfavourably to the 10-year jail term given last week to a police captain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/cairo-prison-abu-zabaal-deaths-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">who was found culpable for the gassing to death of 37 prisoners</a> last August.</p><p>The death sentences are the latest instalment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">campaign of repression</a> that has seen over a thousand in which more than 1,000 dissidents have been killed, thousands more have been arrested, and journalists have been jailed for advocating or reporting narratives that oppose the post-Morsi state.</p><p>But Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University and an expert on the Egyptian judiciary, said the verdict was highly unlikely to have been directly ordered by a central figure such as Egypt's army chief, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p><p>\"Parts of the judicial apparatus are fully on board with the new repressive order, at least for now,\" said Brown. \"Many felt that they were under attack by the Morsi presidency and they have rallied around what might be called the 'party of order' represented by the military, the security apparatus, and the top of the religious establishment.</p><p>\"I think it is more a matter of a common mentality than direct co-ordination. Indeed, the court here has gone so far that it is difficult to see that it serves the interest of the regime.\"</p><p>Egypt's foreign ministry was at pains to emphasise the conditional nature of the sentences, hinting at embarrassment at Monday's events. \"The law allows the verdict to be appealed,\" its statement read, in red type that was emboldened and underlined. It claimed the ruling \"would be overturned as soon as the defendants demand a retrial\".</p><p>More draconian verdicts are feared on Tuesday, with the same Minya court due to try 683 other Brotherhood supporters and officials including its leader, Mohamed Badie, and the head of its political wing, Saad al-Katatny.</p>","headline":"Anger in Egypt as 529 Morsi supporters sentenced to death","trailText":"<p>Muslim Brotherhood calls protests as judge accused of acting out of spite after two-day trial over policeman's death in Minya</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395686576854/Minya-004.jpg","wordcount":"834","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"432879952","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8839551","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley and Manu Abdo in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2064736","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T18:46:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

The security crackdown has severely undermined the Brotherhood's ability to mobilise and stage big street protests. Those who think this way are undoubtedly encouraged by the conduct of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the Ukraine crisis, and the apparent failure of the west to stand up to him. These hawks dismiss any international response to the action of the police or the judiciary as of little consequence.</p><p>There's already been a barrage of criticism both inside Egypt and abroad. The procedure itself lacked basic standards of fairness. Many are ridiculing a legal system that allows for a mockery of justice on this scale to take place. The trial lasted two days, and more than half the defendants are on the run.</p><p>This is not the first time the Egyptian judiciary has attracted widespread condemnation. Last November a court in Alexandria gave <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/12/07/Egypt-courts-hear-appeals-of-jailed-female-protesters.html\" title=\"\">21 Islamist women and teenagers jail sentences of up to 12 years</a> for taking part in a pro-Brotherhood protest that turned violent. The disproportionate punishment produced a howl of protest. The sentences were later commuted on appeal, and the women were released.</p><p>The Egyptian judiciary has a mixed record. It has, for example, given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/02/hosni-mubarak-sentenced-life-prison\" title=\"\">Hosni Mubarak a life sentence</a>, which he's appealed against. He is currently being retried. But none of the police or military accused of killing protesters since the uprising that toppled him in 2011 have been found guilty.</p><p>Given this record, most observers will conclude that the verdict is political, designed to send a message to the Brotherhood and its backers abroad – in Cairo this usually means Turkey and Qatar, which have made no secret of their unwavering support for the Brotherhood– that the Egyptian state is still in no mood to compromise with the Islamists: surrender or annihilation.</p><p>But coming down with a sledgehammer on anything that moves makes the government look more like a raging bull than a confident operator playing by the rules. It also adds to perceptions of the Brotherhood in the outside world as clear victims, despite the fact that government action against the Islamists still enjoys broad support in Egypt itself.</p><p>Within days the electoral commission is expected to issue a timetable for the presidential election. Given that it is the judiciary that will be supervising the election, anything that undermines its independence will cast a long shadow over the electoral process. The credibility of the transition will be called into question if the judiciary is seen to act at the behest of those who hold power.</p><p>Yesterday's verdict comes at a critical moment in Egypt's muddled transition from authoritarian rule to what many still hope, despite all the disturbing signs, will be an elected and representative government. Many others remain sceptical, though. Sentencing almost 530 suspects to death en masse will most probably strengthen the scepticism of those who believe Egypt is heading towards anything but democracy and rule of law.</p>","headline":"A death sentence not just for hundreds of Islamists, but Egypt's democratic future","trailText":"<strong>Magdi Abdelhadi: </strong>The judiciary's role in the sentencing of almost 530 Muslim Brotherhood supporters could destroy faith in the electoral process","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395751395428/Journalists-trial-in-Cair-006.jpg","wordcount":"574","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432941169","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8841049","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Magdi Abdelhadi","internalPageCode":"2065137","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T13:20:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/25/death-sentence-islamists-egypt-democratic-future-muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/25/death-sentence-islamists-egypt-democratic-future-muslim-brotherhood","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/magdi-abdelhadi","webTitle":"Magdi Abdelhadi","r2ContributorId":"47049","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/3/1325604592385/magdi-abdelhadi2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Magdi Abdelhadi is a freelance writer and broadcaster and former Arab affairs analyst for the BBC</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/magdi-abdelhadi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/magdi-abdelhadi","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432941980","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395751385414/Journalists-trial-in-Cair-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"EPA","source":"EPA","photographer":"Tarek Wajeh/Almasry Alyoum","altText":"Journalists trial in Cairo","suppliersReference":"EGY01","height":"54","credit":"Tarek Wajeh/Almasry Alyoum/EPA","caption":"Journalists on trial in Cairo on 24 March for allegedly supporting a terrorist group – the Muslim Brotherhood.

They were convicted after just two court sessions, most in absentia and without being allowed to present a defence. On Tuesday a further 683 members of the Brotherhood, including its leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/aug/20/brotherhood-mohammed-badie-arrested-video\" title=\"\">Mohammed Badie</a>, will face similar charges in the same city. Although many of these sentences are likely to be commuted when the defendants reach the last stage of Egyptian justice and are brought before the grand mufti, legal experts cannot recall a court coming to such draconian conclusions on such a scale. It will send a shudder through those who once cheered on the Egyptian revolution and imagined the country was on the path to democracy.</p><p>There are now so many political prisoners in Egypt that its jails are close to bursting. By the government's own estimate, 16,000 people have been locked up in the crackdown that followed the military coup in July last year in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, the Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, was ousted. Prisoners are packed up to 40 to a cell and are routinely beaten. The thousands rounded up in the past eight months consist largely of members of the Brotherhood, and almost all of its leaders, but include secular revolutionary activists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alaa-abd-el-fattah\" title=\"\">Alaa Abd El Fattah</a>, who was bailed on Tuesday, as well as reporters. Twenty journalists were arrested after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/29/egypt-to-charge-20-al-jazeera-journalists-damaging-countrys-reputation\" title=\"\">accused of spreading misinformation</a> and aiding terrorists.</p><p>To say that Monday's death sentences were ordered by the military leadership as part of the brutal counter-revolution would credit army chief and defence minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/egypt-army-chief-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-indicates-run-presidency\" title=\"\">Abdul Fatah al-Sisi</a> with a level of control he may not have. There is little evidence, in this case, of direct interference from the army in the rulings of the court. A more likely scenario is that parts of the judiciary are fully signed up to the army-led campaign of political repression. They felt threatened by Mr Morsi's government and have rallied round the old establishment, the \"deep state\" of shadowy bureaucrats created by the deposed dictator, Hosni Mubarak.</p><p>The response of Egypt's most important ally to the crackdown against the largest of Arab revolutions has been equivocal. In October, the Obama administration – which famously failed to describe the events that toppled Mr Morsi as a coup because US law forbids Washington from giving money to \"any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree\" – announced it would <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/world/middleeast/obama-military-aid-to-egypt.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">withhold some military and civilian aid</a> to the country, including tanks and fighter aircraft. Congress has since <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/us-circumvents-law-to-transfer-aid-to-egypt/a-17406390\" title=\"\">passed legislation</a> requiring that Egypt make progress on democracy and human rights before the aid, worth $1.5bn, can be released. However, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has declared his intention to unblock the aid as soon as he feels he can. \"We want this interim transitional government to succeed. We are committed to try to help make that happen,\" Mr Kerry told a congressional hearing earlier this month. \"I'm hopeful that in the days ahead I can make the appropriate decision. And when I say days ahead, I mean short term.\"</p><p>Mr Kerry's desire to restore the US subvention to Egypt stems in part from his reluctance to upset another gambit he has in the Middle East: the push to restart the Israel-Palestinian peace process. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.580617\" title=\"\">Israel has been lobbying hard</a> for the release of aid to Cairo's government in recent months because it sees security co-operation between the countries as a major line of defence against Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual ally in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The judge in Minya may have designed his ruling in order to help General Sisi quell the voices of the opposition. If so, he is deluded: his draconian decision will only help push the country deeper into crisis. Before Mr Kerry can even contemplate fully restoring aid, he must demand concrete steps towards democracy and human rights.</p>","headline":"Egypt: death and the deep state","trailText":"<strong>Editorial: </strong>The sentencing of 529 of the Muslim Brotherhood to death will send a shudder through those who cheered on the revolution","newspaperPageNumber":"34","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nz9m","wordcount":"668","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432894075","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8837153","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2064793","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T23:04:52Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-deep-state-editorial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-deep-state-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/hosni-mubarak","webTitle":"Hosni Mubarak","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hosni-mubarak","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

How much power does the country's new strongman, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, intend to wield?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:11:07Z","body":"<p>The activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is one of at least 16,000 political dissidents languishing in an Egyptian jail and it was from his cell that he wrote <a href=\"http://madamasr.com/content/everyone-knows\" title=\"http://madamasr.com/content/everyone-knows\">the following</a> last week: \"Everyone knows that most of those in jail are young, and that oppression is targeting an entire generation to subjugate it to a regime that understands how separate it is from them and that does not want to, and cannot in any case, accommodate or include them.\"</p><p>It is a bleak assessment of contemporary Egypt, three years and two months after a revolution that was supposed to empower Abd El Fattah and many of those in jail with him. In his letter Abd El Fattah highlights the arbitrary nature of many of their detentions, the torture to which thousands have probably been subjected – and the apathy towards, and often enthusiasm for, such malpractice among the public.</p><p>Among Egypt's revolutionaries and rights lawyers, it is no longer remarkable to say the country has returned to the era of Hosni Mubarak – or worse. To Abd El Fattah's portrait of a revolution turned on its head, others might add, among many other criticisms: untrammelled police brutality; journalists jailed; a ban on the kind of protests that drove the 2011 uprising; the exile of Mohamed ElBaradei and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/wael-ghonim-egypt-regime-targets-secular-activists\" title=\"\">Wael Ghonim</a>, two of the politicians and activists most associated with Mubarak's downfall. Plus the likely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">election to the presidency</a> of the army chief whose presence has come hand in hand with the restoration of Mubarak-style oppression: Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p><p>In cabinet, writes one former minister under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/16/egypt-coup-catastrophe-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, whose year-long presidency was toppled last July, \"there is now no one left that has any link to the 25 January revolution\". The nuance of Yahia Hamed's point is debatable, not least because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/protests-egypt-presidential-decree\" title=\"\">Morsi's own government had autocratic leanings</a>, and the extent to which Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood was involved at the start of the 2011 uprising has long been contested. But Hamed's general premise stands: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/egypt-new-prime-minister-ibrahim-mahlab\" title=\"\">Egypt's recent cabinet reshuffle</a> saw the departure of the most moderate voices in government – the secular liberals who supported Morsi's overthrow last July, not because they craved greater authoritarianism but because they wanted less of it.</p><p>But to what extent all this marks a full-circle return to permanent dictatorship – and how similar such a dictatorship would be to Mubarak's – is open to question. It is sometimes assumed that Sisi's grip on power is total. Certainly he enjoys more influence than any other Egyptian and has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large, sycophantic following</a>. But how much power he wields directly – and how much cohesion there is between his army, the secret police, the cabinet, and the judiciary – is unknown.</p><p>\"For me, the most outstanding feature of this moment is that nobody is in charge,\" says Michael Hanna, an analyst of Egyptian politics. \"The military is not really in charge and it's not making systemic decisions.\" Even if Sisi is in favour of it, the thinking goes, he might not be directly co-ordinating Egypt's oppression – which may instead be the result of different factions elsewhere in the state using a vacuum in leadership to assert themselves. \"So the real test comes post-election,\" says Hanna.</p><p>\"Will a President Sisi – with the backing of the military, and with what he would consider a popular mandate – then decide he can make decisions?\"</p><p>However he acts, it should also <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/ahmed-ezz-egypt-sisi-felool.html#\" title=\"\">not be assumed that Sisi represents quite the same elites</a> as Mubarak did. Sisi may have been head of army intelligence under the ousted dictator, and Egypt's latest prime minister may hail from Mubarak's National Democratic party (NDP). But in Mubarak's last years, senior army officials were at loggerheads with the NDP leadership, whose neo-liberal instincts threatened the military's vast economic empire. When Mubarak fell, leaving senior generals in charge, it was those NDP officials – including Mubarak's son Gamal – who were among the first to experience retribution.</p><p>\"The NDP neglected society,\" says one senior officer, who was keen to portray the army as Egypt's salvation. \"Their corruption is the reason people are still suffering. They will never come back and the Mubarak era will never come back. A new era is coming.\"</p><p>As Abd El Fattah's prison letter shows, many fear this new era will nevertheless bear many of the oppressive hallmarks of the old one. But others also maintain that the country's dire economic predicament will not allow any new government to use violence to crush dissent indefinitely. As an increasing range of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/egyptian-army-runs-cairo-buses-strikes-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">workers' strikes</a> show, officials have nothing to offer the public in exchange for the removal of their political rights. And even if the immediate outlook is dark, this argument continues, the residue of revolutionary gains will remain.</p><p>\"I don't think you can roll back the gains of liberal principles in the last few years,\" summarises Samir Radwan, Egypt's first finance minister of the post-Mubarak era, who believes the country's civil society is still in much better shape than it was four years ago.</p><p>Hala Shukrallah, who became Egypt's first female leader of a political party earlier this month, is a case in point. Her rise is one scarcely imaginable four years ago – a reflection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/egypt-christian-woman-leads-dostour-party\" title=\"\">she told the <em>Observer</em></a>, of \"real, deep changes in the psyche of the Egyptian people and the Egyptian youth\".</p><p>Likewise, several activists were arrested for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/egypt-referendum-day-arrives\" title=\"\">campaigning against Egypt's latest constitution</a>, which passed in January. But the text itself, though flawed, represented a small incremental gain: it is comparatively more liberal than any predecessors.</p><p>Detainees enter police custody expecting to be beaten and tortured – but it has not all been one-way traffic. To the surprise of many, the policemen who murdered Khaled Said in 2010 – the attack was one of the rallying points for the 2011 revolution – had their sentences extended last month. A police captain, culpable for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/cairo-prison-abu-zabaal-deaths-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">gassing to death of 37 prisoners</a> inside a prison van last August, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/egypt-police-captain-jail-gassing-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">jailed for 10 years</a> last week. These are extremely rare convictions, and farcically lenient in comparison to the sentences some Morsi supporters have been given simply for protesting. But at a time of seemingly unstoppable police influence, two judges have still been independent enough to convict serving officers.</p><p>It was intriguing, too, to see the face of Hisham Geneina peering from an Egyptian broadsheet last week. Geneina, Egypt's chief auditor, had given an interview criticising the police for obstructing his employees' post-audit of their accounts – and he later expanded on his allegations to the <em>Observer</em>. The accountants who did the police's pre-audit, Geneina said, were paid by the police – which, he argued, caused an obvious conflict of interest. Meanwhile, Geneina's team on the post-audit were sometimes not given the paper records they needed.

In his letter from prison, Alaa Abd El Fattah argues that Egyptians have allowed themselves to become deceived by a bogus promise of gradual progress and the \"show\" of democratic process.</p><p>\"The show helps to normalise the situation,\" Abd El Fattah writes, \"it [diverts people] on to useless routes: negotiations, advice, legal representations, efforts with the media – until the common understanding becomes that anyone who's accused is guilty, that it's up to the revolutionaries to avoid being imprisoned or killed.\"</p><p>He ends with a rousing call to action: \"Everyone knows there is no hope for us who have gone ahead into prison, except through you who will surely follow.
