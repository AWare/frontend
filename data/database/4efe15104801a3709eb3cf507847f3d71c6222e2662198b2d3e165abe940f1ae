But I’ve never heard of Shippea Hill.</strong> Don’t worry, nobody has. Shippea Hill has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35105105\">just been named as Great Britain’s quietest train station</a>.</p> <p><strong>How quiet are we talking? </strong>There were only 22 passenger entries and exits in the whole of 2014. That’s less than one a fortnight.</p> <p><strong>That is quite quiet. </strong>Are you kidding? Compared with 2013, when there were only 12 entries and exits, it’s a throbbing metropolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/comment.transport\">David McKie: Ghost trains to Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>It sounds great! How do I get there? </strong>Travel to Cambridge, then change on to the Abellio Greater Anglia service to Norwich. Shippea Hill is two stops in.</p> <p><strong>That sounds easy enough.</strong> One caveat, though. There’s only one service a day, and if you were travelling from the capital you would need to be on the 5.43am train out of London to get there.</p> <p><strong>I can probably manage that.</strong> Also, trains out of Shippea Hill are so infrequent that you would be stuck there until half past seven the following morning.</p> <p><strong>Fine, I’ll soak up some of the nightlife. What’s around?</strong> Well the charming cathedral city of Ely, the nearest conurbation of note, is a quick two-and-a-half hour walk away, so there’s that. Plus you get to pass a village called Prickwillow on the way. Instagram will love that.</p> <p><strong>Walk? Why can’t I drive there?</strong> Because the Shippea Hill station car park was sold off when British Rail went private in the 1990s. You could always try sleeping in the nearby Wings hostel instead.</p> <p><strong>That sounds nice.</strong> I’m not sure. Judging by Google Maps, the hostel is just a load of portable buildings. It has received only one Google review, a description-free missive from a man named Piotr six months ago. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Wings+Hostel+shippea+hill&amp;lrd=0x47d83e1902417c95:0xa589bad76084d575,1\">He gave it one star</a>.</p> <p><strong>So if Shippea Hill is the quietest station in the country, what’s the busiest?</strong> London Waterloo, which had 99m passenger entries and exits last year.</p> <p><strong>Jesus, no thanks. I’d rather try my luck with Shippea Hill.</strong> Me, too. See you there in a fortnight.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Come to Shippea Hill for the sprawling fields and huge skies.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Stay for the eight-hour walk to the nearest Pret.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11083721","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2425339","internalRevision":"49","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"There’s a picket fence, a nearby hostel and a village that’s ripe for Instagramming.

<p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Once a year.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> All of them.</p> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Well, obviously, this time it’s a Wednesday, but what’s so special about it?</strong> It’s the 350th day of most years. It was the date of the Boston Tea Party in 1773. It’s also, apparently, the worst day of the year to have a birthday*.</p> <p><strong>What’s all this* business*? </strong>What? Oh, it’s just my way of saying there are a few provisos.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, I love a good proviso. Like what?</strong> Well, one thing that makes it a bad birthday is that the days are dark and cold.</p> <p><strong>So, if you like being cosy indoors, or you live in the southern hemisphere or the tropics, then it’s OK?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>What else? </strong>The main problem with 16 December, according to researchers*, is that it’s very close to Christmas, which means people are too busy with other parties to bother with yours. You also get “combined presents”. Worse still, your present may be wrapped in Christmas paper.</p> <p><strong>That’s a disgrace.</strong> Although, obviously, if you don’t celebrate Christmas or live in a Christian country, it’s largely irrelevant.</p> <p><strong>Yes. And even if you agree that it’s bad to have a birthday close to Christmas, why is 16 December worst of all? What about the 17 days that are closer still? </strong>The study* doesn’t say. It was done by an <a href=\"http://www.interflora.co.uk/content/how-good-is-your-birthday\" title=\"\">attention-seeking flower company</a> that got its results by gathering data from 2,000 people who told it how many birthday presents they got, how many people came to their parties and so on.</p> <p><strong>Two thousand people? So each day’s data is based on an average of five?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>And natural variation means that some days probably only have data from one or two people, if any? </strong>Yes.</p> <p><strong>Who actually has a birthday on 16 December? A bunch of losers? </strong>Not unless you think that describes Jane Austen (1775), Wassily Kandinsky (1866), Noël Coward (1899), Arthur C Clarke (1917), Philip K Dick (1928), Quentin Blake (1932), Christopher Biggins (1948) and Bill Hicks (1961).</p> <p><strong>There’s no arguing with a list like that.</strong> Every one a heavy-hitter.</p> <p><strong>So, people can still enjoy 16 December birthdays? </strong>Probably … I did say it was a study*.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>Happy birthday!</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>Prove it!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11080543","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2424606","internalRevision":"44","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Born nine days before Christmas?

<p><strong>Age: </strong>Five thousand years or so.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Elegant, deadly.</p> <p><strong>You mean because they make you fall over? </strong>Nope. I mean because they’re a weapon.</p> <p><strong>Ah, you mean an erotic weapon in the war of the sexes. </strong>Nope. I mean because you can stab people in the head with them.</p> <p><strong>Can I? </strong>With training, certainly. A Canadian self-defence instructor called <a href=\"http://www.soteriamethod.com\" title=\"\">Avital Zeisler</a> has designed a strategy for women who are attacked while they’re wearing heels, and <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1644466.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2015_12_12\" title=\"\">the Sunday Times reports</a> she plans to bring her classes to the UK next year. “I love to wear high heels,” she says. “I wasn’t going to let self-defence compromise the quality of my life or my femininity.”</p> <p><strong>Some might say high heels already compromise her quality of life by increasing the risk of chronic foot, calf and back problems. </strong>They shouldn’t say it to her face. Zeisler is a former dancer who trained in the Israeli martial art of krav maga.</p> <p><strong>So what does she say a woman, or indeed a man, should do if attacked in their heels? </strong>Option one: take them off and run away.</p> <p><strong>Sounds good. I’ll go with that. </strong>You might not have time. In which case there’s option two: run away while wearing them.</p> <p><strong>Tricky.</strong> But doable. You need to practise running on the balls of your feet only. Zeisler can sprint on a treadmill in very high heels.</p> <p><strong>What’s option three?</strong> Fight while wearing them. Lying down, they’re actually an advantage because you can perform a “defensive push-kick” with the point.</p> <p><strong>What’s a defensive push-kick?</strong> Think of it like stamping upwards “into the targets that are available”, Heisler explains in her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bSNkwLxHUY\" title=\"\">instructional video</a>. “Whether it’s face, the groin, whatever I’m dealing with.”</p> <p><strong>Ow ow ow ow ow …</strong> Finally, there’s option four: taking the heel off and using it as a weapon.</p> <p><strong>By hitting people with it? </strong>Basically. Hitting or slashing. Zeisler recommends gripping it around the midsole and performing a hammerfist.</p> <p><strong>Just remind me what a hammerfist is?</strong> Empty-handed, it’s like banging on a door.

Mostly about how great North Korea is, or how happy its people are.

They were scheduled to perform a series of shows at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing, along with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zDV816D6XE\">State Merited Chorus</a>. But over the weekend the shows were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/kim-jong-un-north-korea-girl-group-cancels-beijing-the-moranbong-band\">abruptly cancelled</a> and Moranbong returned to North Korea. </p> <p><strong>Oh. Well, who are the State Merited Chorus then? </strong>They’re basically a musical battalion of the North Korean Army. Both camp and scary at the same time. They also cancelled.</p> <p><strong>Great. So did Chinese people actually want to listen to all this in the first place?</strong> Dunno. North Koreans love them. But the idea of the trip was more about improving relations with the Chinese government.</p> <p><strong>That obviously went well. So it’d have been a bit like when you go to your friend’s house and they insist on playing you their favourite album really loud and you just have to sit there trying to look like you enjoy it? </strong>Yes. Except the friend has nuclear weapons.</p> <p><strong>Do sing:</strong> “If you want to be my lover, you’ve got to get approval from the interior ministry.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t sing:</strong> “Push the Button”.</p> <p><strong>Also known as:</strong> Little

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A big Z on a map of Iceland.</p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>Well, it’s either the oldest religion in the world or the newest, depending on how you look at it.</p> <p><strong>How should I look at it? </strong>Like a giant tax-avoidance scheme.</p> <p><strong>Boo! </strong>No, wait, hear me out. In Iceland, everyone is required to register their religion with the state. They must also pay an annual levy to support the religion they belong to – even if they don’t belong to one.</p> <p><strong>Hang on. Is that fair? </strong>Of course not. That’s why Zuism has taken off. It was registered as an official (though tiny) religion in Iceland in 2013, and has been taken over by new converts promising to refund all its members’ god taxes (minus other taxes and admin costs). About 1% of the population of Iceland – 3,100 people – have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/new-icelandic-religion-sumerian-gods-tax-rebates-zuism\" title=\"\">converted to Zuism in the past fortnight</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wow! Do they, you know, believe stuff?</strong> Of course! They believe in the ancient religion of Sumer, a civilisation that flourished in the south of what is now Iraq from about 5000BC until 2000BC. Sumerian cuneiform is considered to have been the most important early writing system.</p> <p><strong>Do Zuists have a god then? </strong>They have loads. The four main ones are An, Ki, Enlil and Enki, the gods of heaven, earth, sky and water respectively. There are also many sub-gods. “We believe that the universe is controlled by a group of living beings who have human form but are immortal and live the supernatural forces,” says <a href=\"http://www.zuistar.is\" title=\"\">the Zuists’ website</a>, when badly translated.</p> <p><strong>Are there Zuist rituals? </strong>Not ancient ones, no, but they have held a service with a reading of ancient Sumerian poetry. They also say they plan to build a ziggurat or temple.</p> <p><strong>Seriously? </strong>No. The new leadership have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuistar/photos/pb.806815442747648.-2207520000.1449663896./900878336674691/?type=3&amp;theater\" title=\"\">invited designs on Facebook</a>, specifying “a large auditorium and smaller worship and sacrifice rooms ... large ornamental lion park ... alligator moat ... dragon”. Basically, they just want the tax and the religious register abolished, then they say they will disband.</p> <p><strong>How can they call it a real religion if people hardly do anything and only half-heartedly believe?</strong> Sounds just like a real religion to me.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“How can a government get away with forcibly collecting money from everyone in order to spend it on promoting other people’s religion?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Erm ... faith schools?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11061399","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-10T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2421446","internalRevision":"31","publication":"The

Engine</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Newborn.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A leaflet and some money.</p> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> “It’s not a cheap knock-off of the Northern Powerhouse,” says Sajid Javid, secretary of state for business, skills and innovation, who <a href=\" https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/firing-up-the-midlands-engine\" title=\"\">launched it on Friday</a>.</p> <p><strong>I never said it was. </strong>“It’s not an empty piece of political rhetoric!” he added.</p> <p><strong>All right. All right. So if it’s not those things, what is it? </strong>It’s the name of <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2015/12/%E2%80%9Cmidlands-engine%E2%80%9D-plan-gets-government-backing\" title=\"\">a very small funding package</a> to promote the Midlands as a region for inward investment and encourage collaborative working practices between its local authorities.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, what? I dropped off there for a minute. </strong>It’s £5m to spend on persuading outsiders to start a business in the Midlands.</p> <p><strong>Why the Midlands? </strong>Because it has a hard time, growth-wise. “Productivity here is around 10% lower than the national average,” Javid said. “And in 2013, there were around 25,000 job vacancies in the Midlands that were hard to fill due to a lack of suitably skilled local applicants.”</p> <p><strong>That doesn’t sound very persuasive.</strong> You misunderstand. Javid is saying that because other regions perform better than the Midlands, the Midlands <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482247/midlands-engine-for-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">must have more potential to do well</a>.</p> <p><strong>Eh? Maybe the Midlands struggles because of some entrenched combination of its infrastructure, location, natural resources, human resources, climate, culture and reputation?</strong> How dare you suggest that things have reasons! “If the Midlands matches the predicted growth rate for the UK over the next 15 years, it could create 300,000 jobs and boost the national economy by £34bn. That’s too big a prize to ignore.”</p> <p><strong>That’s not a prize, that’s just an imagined number. What makes it realistic to think that the Midlands can match the national growth rate for the next 15 years? </strong>Ah, Javid warned that there would be sneerers. “They sneered when Darby built his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Bridge\" title=\"\">iron bridge</a>,” he said. “They laughed when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Whittle\" title=\"\">Whittle said that jet engines could power aircraft</a>.”</p> <p><strong>That’s an unbelievably dumb comparison. Optimists aren’t always right just because some pessimists were wrong! Plus it’s insulting to think that Midlanders are so stupid that you can convince them with tuppence and a speech. </strong>This guy hates the Midlands, everyone! Get him!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It’s time to fire up the Midlands Engine!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “It’s certainly time to fire someone.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11047202","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2419099","internalRevision":"39","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Secretary of state for business Sajid Javid thinks his new £5m funding package will do just that.

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 15, tops.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Pragmatic, independent, digitally native.</p> <p><strong>Hold up, that’s not a description. It’s just a meaningless list of marketing buzzwords.</strong> Well, you would say that. You’re a millennial. You ruin everything.</p> <p><strong>Can we start again? We seem to have got off on the wrong foot.</strong> Fine. The Founders is the name that has been given to the new post-millennial generation, referring to anyone born after December 2000.</p> <p><strong>Why are they so pragmatic and independent?</strong> Because each generation rebels against the previous one, and millennials are famously needy and entitled.</p> <p><strong>How dare you say that! I’m totally going to no-platform you. </strong>See? <a href=\"http://time.com/4130679/millennials-mtv-generation/\">According to the president of MTV</a>, who came up with the term, the Founders are identified by “this self-awareness that systems have been broken. But they can’t be the generation that says we’ll break it even more.”</p> <p><strong>That’s why they’re called the Founders? </strong>Yes, because it will be their job to repair a world that millennials have mucked up beyond repair.</p> <p><strong>What’s the cause of this intergenerational behavioural shift?</strong> Well, one theory is that the Founders are the first generation to be parented by Generation X (who grew up with realistic expectations and ended up slightly disenfranchised), as opposed to millennials (who were raised by soppy-faced baby boomer optimists and ended up horrifically risk-averse and entitled). Frankly, I like the sound of the Founders a lot more.</p> <p><strong>It’s a terrible name, though.</strong> You should have heard some of the alternatives. According to MTV, other potential names included the Plurals, the Navigators, the Regenerators, iGen, ReGen and the Homeland Generation.</p> <p><strong>That sounds like the worst Battle of the Bands lineup in history. </strong>Exactly. Founders is easily the best of a bad bunch.</p> <p><strong>We should write a letter of thanks to the faceless team of corporate bureaucrats who were paid to arbitrarily name this upcoming generation of superheroes, then.</strong> Seriously, you millennials. You’re the absolute worst.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Thank goodness MTV has discovered the name of this emerging generation.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “It’s just a shame that <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/mtv-ratings-decline-raises-relevance-questions-young-people-cut-cable-cord-devices-1881468\">none of them will ever know what MTV

dream.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 20 years, give or take.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Everywhere, for now.</p> <p><strong>What do you mean? </strong>Well, buy-to-let mortgages have become increasingly popular since the mid-1990s. They account for about 15% of all home loans, and lending on them was up 10% in the first nine months of 2015. But now their golden age might be coming to an end.</p> <p><strong>Is this where you borrow money to buy a house, then you rent the house to someone else and use the rent to pay back the loan? </strong>That’s right. And you pocket the difference as profit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-scrutinises-vulnerable-buy-to-let-mortgages\">Bank of England scrutinises 'vulnerable' buy-to-let mortgages</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So it’s like </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/26/returns-for-buy-to-let-landlords-dwarf-other-investments\"><strong>getting free money</strong></a><strong>?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Why isn’t everybody doing it? </strong>Plenty are, but you also need quite a lot of money to start with, for the deposit. Once you’re in, though, buy-to-let mortgages drive house prices up, which in turn means more people can’t afford to buy and have to rent, which drives up rent prices, which makes buying to let even more attractive.</p> <p><strong>Magic! So they’re dividing Britons back into landed aristocrats and serfs?</strong> Basically.</p> <p><strong>What’s the problem?</strong> The serfs don’t like it.</p> <p><strong>Bloody serfs.</strong> But things might even get tricky for the aristocrats if rents fall or interest rates rise because then some won’t be able to keep up the repayments, which means everything gets repossessed by the bank. <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-3149797/Is-Britain-sitting-200bn-buy-let-time-bomb-Landlords-borrow-vast-sums-fund-property-empires.html\">And if house prices fall too, the bank may not get all its money back</a>, which means it might not be able to pay its debts to other banks, which means they don’t have as much money as they thought either, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/01/buy-to-let-boom-jeopardise-financial-stability-bank-england-house-prices\">all their market values collapse</a>.</p> <p><strong>This is sounding awfully familiar.</strong>Yeah. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-scrutinises-vulnerable-buy-to-let-mortgages\">Bank of England thinks it looks a bit 2008-y, so they’re going to stop banks lending too much</a>. George Osborne has also announced a three-point rise in stamp duty for buy-to-letters, which comes into effect next April. Plus there will probably be a rise in interest rates quite soon.</p> <p><strong>Thank goodness someone has the sense to stop this becoming a property bubble.</strong> I’d better get a buy-to-let mortgage quickly while they’re still cheap! Um … actually that’s kind of where bubbles come from.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Should we maybe, you know, build more houses?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Can I apply for a lie-to-bet mortgage instead?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11035303","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2416697","internalRevision":"71","publication":"The
