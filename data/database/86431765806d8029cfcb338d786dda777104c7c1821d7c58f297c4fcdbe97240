The worst thing about this terrifying insurgency? My mum is part of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/were-not-cult-members-labour-supporters-at-corbyn-rallies\">'We're not cult members': Labour supporters at Corbyn rallies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am, of course, talking about the people who support Jeremy Corbyn – 12,000 of whom have joined <a href=\"http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/\">Momentum</a>, the activist movement that propelled Corbyn to power. And after Monday’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court win and a clean sweep in the elections</a> to Labour’s national executive committee, support for Corbyn shows no signs of abating – despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/762699781546381312?s=09\">continued suggestions</a> that those supporters are nothing more than an abusive rabble. How many of the journalists writing panicked screeds about these awful people have actually met any of them, do you think? I ask because writing about the Corbyn phenomenon over the last year means I’ve met probably hundreds of his supporters and to be honest, I find dealing with them the most pleasant element of writing about Corbyn.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I went to a political event that included a branch of Momentum. All young women; they were energetic, funny and very friendly. Two weeks ago, I had a debate with a Momentum member about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/14/does-jeremy-corbyn-have-a-media-strategy-apparently-not\">Corbyn’s media strategy</a>. Of the two of us, it was me who was the ruder, more impatient one. When Corbyn ran for leadership last year, I visited phone banks for him dozens of times, and spent hours in the company of the very people who went on to found Momentum. I told myself I was <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/11/britains-bernie-sanders-is-about-to-win-big-jeremy-corbyn-labour/\">researching a piece</a>; actually I think I just liked talking to them.</p> <p>Sure, my experiences of these Corbyn supporters might not be representative. But they do suggest that the depiction of them as a madcap bunch of deluded cultists is not representative either. Broadly speaking, the media has failed to understand the political moment in the Labour party; it has shown a damning lack of interest in the fact that people who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands – preferring instead to dismiss them as an angry mob.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One half of that description is accurate, however. Corbyn supporters may not be a mob, but they are angry. And to understand why, it is useful to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/jeremy-gilbert/is-momentum-mob-no-this-is-what-democracy-looks-like\">consider the words</a> of the academic Jeremy Gilbert, a longstanding Labour member and activist who has joined Momentum: “Momentum is simply trying to give a voice to a body of opinion which has been widespread throughout the country for many years, but has been denied any kind of place in our public life since the early days of New Labour. It is a body of opinion which believes, with good reason, that the embrace of neoliberal economics and neoconservative foreign policy under Blair was a disaster … Naturally some of those voices, suppressed for so long, sound raucous, aggressive and uncouth.”</p> <p>The anger that commentators detect in the Corbyn movement, in my experience, is not a symptom of the fact that it has been infiltrated by bullies – but that its members feel as though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/labour-coup-disastrous-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour coup</a> is as much an attack on their right to participate in public discourse as it is on Corbyn.</p> <p>Everything the left traditionally stands for – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\">human rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">socialism</a> to a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/02/the-iraq-wars- real-victims- laurie-penny- and-the- narcissistic-left/\">foreign policy driven by diplomacy</a> – has been, at best, marginalised and, at worst, actively mocked in mainstream political discourse since the 1970s. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of the trade unions, the last bastions of organised British socialism, as insidious barons intent on wrecking British life (a claim that sounds particularly ludicrous when made by newspapers who supported the Conservatives at the last election – a party consisting of members of the actual landed gentry).</p> <p>I am yet to meet a single Corbynite who is naive about Corbyn’s failings as a leader, the great challenges he faces, or who does not want to win a general election. But the reason so many have coalesced around him anyway is because they view his leadership as the only opportunity they have had in at least 30 years to see their views finally represented in public life. The Labour rebels’ attempt to unseat him is, in their minds, as much an attempt to excommunicate the wider left as it is to get rid of Corbyn himself. Perhaps the most salient evidence of this is the decision to charge affiliate members £25 to vote in the leadership election, and ban outright members who joined fewer than six months ago – a decision that has now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">overturned in court</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pd7c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2627517\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a06c0ae4b07e27cb7e00e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\">Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Worse still for Corbyn supporters, the policy positions they have taken over the last 30 years have often been proven right. Lack of social housing has led to a spiralling housing crisis; the deregulation of the financial industry would have caused economic collapse had it not been for state intervention; queasiness around public ownership has caused escalating transport costs and arguably the shambles that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Railway</a>; inequality is the UK’s most pressing social issue; a reluctance to rein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels\">fossil fuel companies</a> has led to a climate emergency; and even Tony Blair accepts that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-sorry-iraq-war-mistakes-admits-conflict-role-in-rise-of-isis\">Iraq war may have led to the rise of Isis</a>. This is why so many Corbyn supporters are upset by the coup, and why they have decided to back him unequivocally, in spite of the incompetence that has at times been part of his leadership.</p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/owen-smith-plan-low-paid-workers-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith</a> supporters who are horrified by Labour’s poll ratings. But I have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with Corbyn supporters, and who have not reflected on why they lost control of their party to someone they so clearly regard as useless. There are simply not enough delusional Leninists in Britain to make up the entirety of Corbyn’s support – these are ordinary British voters who want radical solutions to a growing number of crises. And until they are listened to and taken seriously, Corbyn and the movement keeping him in power is not going anywhere.</p>","wordcount":"1037","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T09:00:10Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T13:57:39Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T09:00:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57a88fd3e4b033cb0795e12e","internalOctopusCode":"11790594","internalPageCode":"2639723","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T23:26:21Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q3ve","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7246a34cbc130094b988fea5393cef35b5d22b1/0_352_5568_3342/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"115","internalShortId":"/p/4q3ve"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-voters-labour-leader-politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-voters-labour-leader-politics","webTitle":"Corbyn

the conflict in the Middle East.</p> <p>Asked in a televised debate whether the terrorist group, which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria and has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in the west, should be allowed to join talks about resolving the conflicts in the Middle East, Smith said “all actors” should be involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\">

State needs to 'get round the table' – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By contrast, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has sometimes been accused of being too willing to associate himself with extremist groups, said Isis should not be allowed to take part in talks. “No, they are not going to be round the table, no.” Later a spokesman for Corbyn criticised Smith’s remarks as “hasty and ill-considered”.<br /></p> <p>Smith, who was a special adviser to Paul Murphy, Northern Ireland secretary in Tony Blair’s government, said: “I worked on the Northern Ireland peace process for three years; I was part of the UK’s negotiating team that helped bring together the loyalist paramilitaries.</p> <p>“My view is that, ultimately, all solutions to these international crises do come about through dialogue, so eventually if we are to try to solve this all of the actors do need to be involved. But at the moment Isil [Isis] are clearly not interested in negotiating. At some point for us to resolve this, we will need to get people round the table.”</p> <p>He later clarified the remarks in a Facebook Q&amp;A, saying Isis would have to “renounce violence, cease all acts of terror and commit themselves to a peaceful settlement”, before any talks could take place.</p> <p>But his comments were seized on by the Conservatives, with Johnny Mercer, the MP and member of the defence select committee, saying: “His desperate attempts to out-Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn have led him to the view that barbaric murderers who behead journalists and lynch homosexuals are now the sort of people that we should negotiate with.</p> <p>“It shows that whoever wins this increasingly bizarre leadership election, I’m afraid Labour just cannot be trusted with keeping us safe.”</p> <p>Corbyn has previously suggested a back-channel to Isis should be maintained as part of efforts to resolve the Syria crisis.</p> <p>“The British government maintained a channel to the IRA all through the Troubles,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in January. “I don’t condemn them for that. I don’t condemn them for keeping a back-channel to the Taliban.</p> <p>But a spokesman for Corbyn’s campaign said : “Jeremy has always argued that there must be a negotiated political solution to the war in Syria and the wider Middle East, and that maintaining lines of communication during conflicts is essential. But Isis cannot be part of those negotiations. Instead, its sources of funding and supplies must be cut off.”</p> <p>Smith, the MP for Pontypridd and former shadow work and pensions secretary, announced that he would challenge Corbyn after the Labour leader was hit by a series of resignations from his shadow cabinet, and lost the confidence of 172 of his MPs.</p> <p>The battle for the future of Labour has become increasingly ill-tempered, with the deputy leader, Tom Watson, claiming last week that Corbyn’s leadership has encouraged hard left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">“Trotsky entryists” to seek to infiltrate the party</a>.</p> <p>Smith and Corbyn locked horns repeatedly in Wednesday’s two-hour-long debate, clashing over Smith’s claims that the Labour leader has failed to do enough to crack down on bullying and antisemitism.</p> <p>One young party member in the audience, Francesca, said she had witnessed intimidating behaviour at a recent Labour youth meeting, and suggested she would feel safer as a Labour supporter at a Tory conference than a non-Corbyn supporter at a Labour conference.</p> <p>Victoria Derbyshire, who hosted the debate on the BBC News channel, suggested the atmosphere in the Labour party had become “toxic”; but Corbyn shot back: “Well how do you know?”</p> <p>He added: “I attend large amounts of events all over the country where there are people of all shades of opinion having a respectful and intelligent debate; that’s how we should do things at all time.”</p> <p>Europe marked another dividing line, with Smith repeating his promise to offer the electorate a choice about whether to accept whatever Brexit deal Britain managed to negotiate, with a second referendum or a general election. He described the decision to leave the EU as “a desperate mistake for our country”.</p> <p>Student fees were another area of contention, with Corbyn saying he would scrap them, while Smith would fund university education through a graduate tax.</p> <p></p> <p>Britain’s nuclear deterrent was another issue over which the pair set out differing positions, with Corbyn saying he would arm the Trident submarines with conventional weapons instead of nuclear warheads, while Smith said he believed in multilateral disarmament.</p> <p>Smith said he had been a unilateralist in the past, saying: “I used to hold that view, I don’t any longer. I think we should negotiate our way to get rid of nuclear weapons. The country wants the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party to be serious about the security of our country.” </p> <p>Corbyn, by contrast, described nuclear weapons as, “unconscionable”.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"7","wordcount":"867","creationDate":"2016-08-17T09:57:45Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-17T10:32:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57b43519e4b062ce4d224297","internalOctopusCode":"11821394","internalPageCode":"2662480","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T21:00:57Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Corbyn said negotiations should involve the Assad government and others in “proximity talks”. He said Islamic State “shouldn’t be round the table, no”.</p> <p>Smith went much further. He said: “At some point, for us to resolve this, we will need to get people round the table.”</p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>Corbyn said he would fight against any consequences Brexit would have for workers’ rights, environmental protection and access to the market for British industry, but stopped short of saying Labour should work to prevent Brexit.</p> <p>Smith says Brexit is “a desperate mistake for our country” and said he would keep making the argument for EU membership.</p> <h2>Student fees</h2> <p>This was a key policy difference that emerged between the two. Smith said he was against fees but favoured a graduate tax as a way of funding universities.</p> <p>Corbyn said he was opposed to both, and said he would scrap fees and increase public funding of universities via higher corporation taxation.</p> <h2>Economy </h2> <p>Corbyn’s spending plans were vaguer than Smith’s but the debate saw the former work and pensions secretary acknowledge borrowing would increase and the deficit rise for his proposed £200bn infrastructure investment, using long-term loans. He also said tax changes would lead to increased revenue of £13bn.</p> <p>Asked about his spending and borrowing plans, Corbyn cites his policies of the national investment bank and transport policies which he said would help grow the economy, as well as tax rises. But he was unable to say what extent of economic growth would be required to fully fund his proposals.</p> <p>Handing over now to my colleague Haroon Siddique who will take you through the political reaction into the afternoon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:54:03.646Z\">at 11.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b436e9e4b0178756b5d79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:06:18.250Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It’s been a lively debate but I think this – as close as Corbyn gets to an angry voice – is one of the best bits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jeremy Corbyn telling Owen Smith to be quiet is my new jam <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VictoriaLIVE?src=hash\">#VictoriaLIVE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw\">https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw</a></p>&mdash; Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">August 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:11:17.568Z\">at 11.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b434cce4b062ce4d224296\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:59:40.812Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The debate is over now and large swaths of the undecided section of the audience have moved over to support Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>One said it was Corbyn’s commitment to community activism that persuaded him and another by his arguments on child mental health which he stated at the end of the programme.</p> <p>Another, remaining in the middle, says she is still genuinely unconvinced, and has decided she will abstain. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:01:03.758Z\">at 11.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b43429e4b062ce4d224291\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:56:20.600Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smith’s comments on Islamic State are creating a bit of a stir on social media.

The Labour leadership hustings are beginning to feel a bit like that. Slowly dawning horror and that weird kind of embarrassment that comes from watching someone do things they will, definitely, regret later.</p> <p>Each hustings heaps on the misery. The BBC show this morning, dwelling on internal arguments for almost the whole of the first hour, was a bleak illustration of how angry and nasty people get when they are positively encouraged to be, you know, nasty and angry. It was like a couples counselling session where the partners were instructed to say what they really think and don’t worry about the consequences.</p> <p>No wonder one young woman said she’d rather tell a Tory conference she was Labour than a Labour conference she was an Owen Smith supporter. Unfortunately, that’s an entry level lesson in politics: arguments with your own side are infinitely more wounding than fights with the enemy. </p> <p>But pretending there isn’t a row doesn’t help either. Smith is smart enough, surely, to realise that telling one great big porky (there is no rift between the MPs and the membership) makes everyone look a bit sideways at everything else you assert. It didn’t help that he knew who Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber were. Each tiny success made him that bit less appealing than Jeremy Corbyn. Failing to recognise Ant and Dec ought to make Corbyn look a tiny bit less ordinary than he pretends, but instead it becomes just another aspect of his virtue.</p> <p>This is the impossibility of this dystopian contest. Everything Smith says sounds a bit like the clever kid at the front of the class giving the right answer. Everything Corbyn says, even the grotesque populism of his claim to be unable to say whether he preferred Leon Trotsky or the man who won Labour three elections, brought peace to Northern Ireland, introduced the Human Rights Act and the minimum wage and almost doubled spending on the NHS, Tony Blair – even this gobsmacking piece of juvenilia just slicks another impenetrable layer of authenticity that is a Teflon coating against all rational criticism.</p> <p>Poor Owen Smith. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28zKZPnK_Tg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/28zKZPnK_Tg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-wearing\">David Wearing</a>: Ant, Dec and football – but little policy discussion</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8886305ab74f487951c24e50255a44f356f6fcf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8886305ab74f487951c24e50255a44f356f6fcf2/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"David Wearing\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Putting it as gently as possible, the BBC did not quite cover itself in glory in its role as a public service broadcaster this morning. Over an hour and 20 minutes of a two-hour programme had elapsed before the discussion turned to substantive issues of policy. First we learned that Owen Smith couldn’t remember the score from the Wales v Belgium match in June, and that Jeremy Corbyn couldn’t recognise a photo of Ant and Dec. Fascinating stuff, no doubt, to a nation experiencing a decade-long squeeze in living standards, and a deeply uncertain economic future.</p> <p>There was much discussion of the divisions within Labour, but barely any serious exploration of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives\">the political basis for those divisions</a> actually is. The section of the debate devoted to the issue of abuse within the party generated more heat than light. Labour members in the audience were clear that abuse had flown in both directions, but Smith was determined to make the mud stick to Corbyn alone. The opportunity could have been taken to debate the substance of the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/party-documents/ChakrabartiInquiry.pdf\">Shami Chakrabarti report</a>, but instead there was cheap innuendo about the integrity of a woman who has been Britain’s leading civil liberties advocate over the past 13 years. None of this was particularly constructive.</p> <p>The mere 35 minutes devoted to policy rendered what discussion there was largely superficial. There was one fascinating moment when Smith appeared to advocate talking to Isis, which Corbyn sensibly had ruled out, but the significance of this was missed, and the debate moved on. </p> <p>By the end BBC viewers could have been forgiven for wondering why the press and leading Labour figures have spent so much of the past week talking about Trotskyism. There were no calls from Corbyn for the violent overthrow of the state, the abolition of private property or the installation of a communist regime. All the middle-aged guy from Wiltshire appeared to be suggesting was that British capitalism should be run a little less like America’s version, and a little more like Sweden’s. </p> <p>It was the basic reasonableness of his position – in spite of his sometimes maddening failure to give sharper, more focused answers – that saw most of the neutral section of the audience expressing their support for him at the end of the debate.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ayesha-hazarika\">Ayesha Hazarika</a>: Not navel gaze? We’re going for a full political endoscopy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb66b2408190685ec189f0a445409340c2c446ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb66b2408190685ec189f0a445409340c2c446ca/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith are having a gruelling August, hauling themselves from gig to gig playing to difficult, hard to please crowds, getting brutal reviews and by this point, even they must be bored of their own material. Today’s debate was hard work for everyone, but especially the viewer. </p> <p>Most of the two-hour extravaganza was spent talking about infighting with a small amount of policy discussion and then went back to both sides taking lumps out of each other and trading tales of Twitter trolling. This is not the fault of the show, it’s a reflection of where the Labour party is now. We are a party that laughs in the face of the political cliche: “We must not navel gaze and look inwards.” Get lost. We’re going for a full political endoscopy.</p> <p>Corbyn started off strong and looking as cool as a cucumber. His answer to the question “What do you do in your spare time?” was impressive. He runs, tends his allotment, reads widely, makes stuff (jam I presume) and cycles. If this doesn’t work out he could be a life coach. Smith’s answer was less inspiring as he trotted out his CV and talked about his kids but that’s OK because he knows who Taylor Swift is.</p> <p>The two men traded some blows on handling abuse within the party and Brexit but there didn’t really feel like there was much of an exploration of the big issues. Smith managed to get under Corbyn’s skin a few times and we saw an interesting new Team Corbyn debating manoeuvre which is basically yelling, “How do YOU know?”</p> <p>But we didn’t really learn anything new from the debate. We saw that Smith is a good performer who is concerned with how Labour can get back into power. We saw that Corbyn is popular and he won with the undecideds in the audience. That the current party mood feels members are the most important people in politics. And we saw that the big questions like how are we ever going to make things happen are not really important right now.</p> <p>It’s going to be a long summer.</p>","wordcount":"1171","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-17T18:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-17T09:55:35Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-17T12:09:02Z","internalComposerCode":"57b43497e4b062ce4d224293","internalPageCode":"2662475","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T19:02:16Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v765","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a615639c3c2a8fff56607d408afd885712b7a1fc/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"478","internalShortId":"/p/5v765"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-panel","webTitle":"Did Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith win this hustings?

Today this train is completely ram-packed.

Further transport-centred rallies will then take place in the Midlands.<br /></p> <p>The Labour leader will say the ongoing chaotic delays on the route are proof that “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-rmt-union-modernise-ceo-strike\">private transport operators cannot be trusted with having passengers’ best interests at heart</a>”.</p> <p>“Public ownership of our railways is needed now to fix the transport nightmare we are currently faced with, and we know there is overwhelming support among the British public for a people’s railway,” he will say. </p> <p>“It is only by bringing the railways back under public ownership as the contracts expire, that we will fix the rail crisis and I’m pleased that even some Tory politicians are now joining us in calling for Southern rail to immediately be brought under public ownership.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447c8d834e14c703414a25be3c96c29e034d55bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447c8d834e14c703414a25be3c96c29e034d55bf/224_340_2095_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn will set out a series of plans to improve Britain’s bus and rail network.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, has also said he is in favour of renationalising the railways. However, Corbyn will also announce a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies, which he will say will lead to improvements in rural and more socially useful bus routes. </p> <p>Corbyn will say: “Together these plans for the bus and rail network will help us rebuild and transform Britain’s transport system, so that no one and no community is left behind.” </p> <p>The Labour leader’s bus plan is based on research by Transport for Quality of Life, who have estimated local authority bus franchising could generate net financial gains of up to £340m a year if introduced nationwide. A Labour government would use the funds to restore cuts to the bus service operators’ grant, Corbyn’s campaign said. </p> <p>On Monday, Corbyn was revealed to have swept the board of constituency Labour party nominations, winning the support of 285 constituency Labour parties and Smith taking just 53 nominations.</p> <p>Nominations do not have a bearing on the leadership voting process but act as statements of support. Ballot papers will be sent out by post and email next Monday, to be returned by 21 September with a midday deadline.

There is support here for a different way of doing politics and I hope all my colleagues in parliament will reflect on that and reflect on how we can work together.”</p> <p>Corbyn has spent Tuesday campaigning on transport, meeting commuters at London Bridge station during a protest by unions against the beleaguered Southern rail, followed by campaign rallies in Derby and Matlock. </p> <p>Speaking in Derby, Corbyn he it was the 21st speech of his leadership campaign, which aimed to visit every major city and town in the UK. He renewed his pledge to renationalise the railways, which he said would mean bringing each franchise back into public ownership when it came up for renewal. </p> <p>“The costs of rail travel will be borne by public as a whole and profits will go to the public,” he said. “Profits from the east coast mainline are now going to Virgin. </p> <p>“This campaign is about the election of one person to be leader of the party. But put it this way, it’s a campaign about the kind of country we want to live in and the place we want to play in the world. </p> <p>“Our programme is about social justice, opportunities for all and a sustainable economy, but it is also about how we do our politics. Do we allow an elite to decide what the politics should be, what the policies are … or is it about the participation of the hundreds of thousands who are now part of our party and our movement??”</p> <p>His campaign says passengers could see savings of up to 10%, though critics have said in practice that it would take several years for any savings to trickle down to passengers.</p> <p>Corbyn also announced what his team said was a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies.</p> <p>His leadership rival Owen Smith’s campaign said on Tuesday that the policies the Corbyn campaign had announced were not new. Rail renationalisation was agreed by the last shadow cabinet, and Smith’s campaign also said the proposals on bus networks had been agreed in 2012 when Maria Eagle was transport secretary.</p> <p>“There is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying. He is simply rehashing existing Labour party policy,” a spokesman for the Smith campaign said. “Owen has pledged to go further to improve our rail and bus networks by promising a £200bn ‘British New Deal’ to invest in things like transport services to help get the country moving again.”</p>","wordcount":"652","creationDate":"2016-08-16T14:07:44Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-16T15:28:37Z","internalComposerCode":"57b31e30e4b0178756b5d3ae","internalPageCode":"2660374","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T07:31:01Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5v49a","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeac68cc5f24fd5bbb167d20d892ff95792db761/0_105_2067_1241/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"714","internalShortId":"/p/5v49a"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-might-forget-labour-mps-criticisms-if-he-wins-leadership-race-nationalisation-railways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-might-forget-labour-mps-criticisms-if-he-wins-leadership-race-nationalisation-railways","webTitle":"Corbyn

It helps with research, but it can’t make medicines,” he said. “It would be physically impossible for the NHS to be able to trial medicines around the world, so of course we will always rely on external forces, companies essentially, to be able to make medicines.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/15/creeping-privatisation-nhs-official-data-owen-smith-outsourcing\">How much is the government really privatising the NHS?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith’s early campaign has been dogged by accusations that he lobbied for further private sector involvement in the NHS during his time working for pharmaceuticals companies Pfizer and Amgen. At the launch of his campaign in July, Jeremy Corbyn said medical research should not be “farmed out” to big companies such as Pfizer, but should be funded through the Medical Research Council. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, later said that Corbyn’s comments had been misinterpreted, announcing that Labour would seek to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/24/labour-proposes-scrapping-1bn-tax-relief-innovation-patent-box-pharmaceuticals\">reform or scrap a £1bn tax relief</a> designed to promote innovation in companies, including in pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian following Monday’s speech, Smith said: “Medicines have always been developed in the private sector and provided to the NHS. It was frankly a bit silly of Jeremy to say that all medicines should be developed in the NHS.</p> <p>“That’s obviously totally implausible. It would bankrupt the NHS even if it were possible, which of course it isn’t, and he was just using the fact that I’ve worked for big biotech companies as a stick with which to beat me.</p> <p>“Truthfully, it’s useful to have somebody who understands how big companies operate and it’s completely wrong to suggest that that in any way means I’m in favour of private provision. I’ve never been in favour of it.”</p> <p>Asked if he had any criticism of his former employers, Smith said: “Yeah, I think medicines should be cheaper, generally. That’s the key criticism I have. I think medicines should be cheaper across the world.”</p> <p>In his speech, the former shadow work and pensions secretary spoke about the threat of creeping privatisation in the NHS and highlighted Department of Health figures showing that spending on private sector NHS providers had doubled under the Conservatives, from more than £4bn in 2009-10 to £8.7bn in 2015-16. Smith has pledged to increase health spending by 4% a year if he becomes prime minister.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/judges-and-infiltrators-in-labours-civil-war\">Judges and infiltrators in Labour’s civil war | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to an audience of supporters and journalists in Salford, Smith argued that the last Labour government had opened the door for the Tories to introduce an increasing amount of private sector involvement in the health service.</p> <p>“I do think the last Labour government did use private sector providers in order to clear [waiting lists for] hip operations and knee operations and cataracts, and for those individual patients I think that was a worthwhile thing because we inherited – as we will again – massive waiting lists for those key bits of surgery,” he said.</p> <p>“The reality is I think we failed to appreciate the way in which the Tories would use those words and use the fact Labour had relied on some private sector provision as a Trojan horse for what they wanted to do, which was to break up, denationalise and privatise the NHS. I think perhaps we were naive about the extent to which they would usurp those themes and subvert them.</p> <p>“I think we need to be clear in this generation, as I am, that we have red lines and those are that we want this NHS to be publicly owned, publicly delivered – 100% if possible. There will always be some instances, as I said, medicines, that are effectively produced in the private sector and purchased by the NHS, but we should be very, very clear that what we want is something that represents that fundamental Labour belief.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"702","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T15:09:27Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T14:15:26Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T15:09:27Z","internalComposerCode":"57b1ce7ee4b062ce4d2238d7","internalPageCode":"2657740","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-15T21:39:18Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Then, after lunch, <a href=\"http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0017200001010\">Tony Benn stood up</a>. He promised to abolish the House of Lords, enact an industry bill “within days” of coming to power to take ownership of key private industries – and to return all powers ceded to Brussels. Even from high up in the balcony of the Blackpool Winter Gardens, I could see Benn’s eyes were on fire.</p> <p>Three years later, Labour bombed in the 1983 general election. Its manifesto, though only a pale reflection of Benn’s leftwing programme, was dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/labour.margaretthatcher\">“the longest suicide note in history”</a>. Today, with a mass influx of left-leaning members and a slump in the polls, parallels with the early 1980s are being drawn. They are almost all false.</p> <p>First, because we are at the other end of the neoliberal era, and as an economic model it is broken. Labour lost in 1979, and saw its membership almost halve because it had clung to a failing system – Keynesian economics – long after it ceased to work. All the momentum, in ideas, in broader society and among the elite, was towards the free-market, authoritarian project we now call Thatcherism. In that situation, to make traditional-left Keynesianism work, as Benn suggested, would have meant an all-out clash with both the market and the state. Labour’s poll ratings – which collapsed in Foot’s first year – were a signal that its electoral base was not up for that.</p> <p>By contrast, today neoliberal capitalism is busted, discredited and on life support. The whey-faced remnants of “old Toryism” may have crowded around the cabinet table, but their free-market philosophy has come apart. The fact that people are flooding into a left-led Labour party, not out of it, is evidence of a search for answers among broad sections of the population.</p> <p>The next most obvious difference is the absence of what we used to call the “industrial struggle”. It has been invigorating to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">Deliveroo drivers on wildcat strike</a>, together with migrant hotel cleaners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">train guards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/80-percent-junior-doctors-took-part-in-all-out-strike\">junior doctors</a> all in a single summer. But the leftism we carried with us into the Winter Gardens in 1980 had its origins in the syndicalism of ordinary workers in the 1970s. To the shop stewards I met in the years between Benn’s 1980 speech and the miners’ strike, Labour politics were a sideshow.</p> <p>The unions had achieved control of many workplaces and – it seemed – could go on calling the shots. In the year Benn made his electrifying speech, the steelworkers’ union had just won a double-digit pay rise in an all-out strike. To the wider left, of shop stewards, feminists, black community activists, a group such as Militant – which had moulded its entire practice, and even its clothing to conform with the dreariness of internal Labour life – seemed irrelevant. Its claimed membership of 2,300 in 1981 – out of 348,000 - sounds about right.</p> <p>Today, work is much less central to the left project, and for a variety of reasons. It is precarious, hard to organise. Also, the things the left wants to achieve have become more social, less industrial. There is, on the left, an implicit understanding of political philosopher Toni Negri’s claim: that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workerism\">the “factory” is now the whole of society,</a> and the subject of change is everybody – especially the networked youth.</p> <p>I do not recall many of the miners and engineers who fought for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981 being existentially devastated when he narrowly lost. They knew this was just a warm-up for the decisive battle, which would happen in barricaded pit villages four years later. This generation, by contrast, understands that the most revolutionary thing you can do to neoliberalism is to put a party in government that dismantles it.</p> <p>And that, in turn, reflects another big difference: the rule of law is stronger now. Everybody involved in the Bennite movement sensed that Britain’s legal institutions were so weak, its police, security services and judiciary so politicised, its constitution so malleable, that the scenario in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/07/past.comment\">Chris Mullin’s novel A Very British Coup</a> was not paranoia. Today, though the secret state is large, it is under much stronger legislative control. Should a leftwing Labour party come to power – either on its own or in coalition with left nationalists – it is likely to be able to govern relatively free of politicised sabotage from the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/europe-owen-smith-beats-jeremy-corbyn-labour\">When it comes to Europe, Owen Smith beats Jeremy Corbyn hands down | Neil Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels, though. As with the SDP, there is a prospect that a few entitled Labour MPs will split, and that the media will get behind the narrative that they are the “true” Labour party. Disunity has already damaged Labour in the polls, just as it did with Michael Foot.</p> <p>But the differences are what should make these, for the British left, days of hope.</p> <p>Michael Foot was a dire leader not because he was too old or too leftwing (or wore a duffel coat), but because he was a compromise candidate, constantly torn between the interests of the unions – who were largely on the right – and the membership, which had moved left. His 1983 manifesto was actually well crafted, but they were the right ideas at the wrong time.</p> <p>Whatever you think of Corbyn (I support him and will campaign to keep him as leader), today is the right time for the idea that neoliberalism is over; that the state should shape, control and sometimes suppress the market; that austerity is self-defeating; that more expeditionary warfare cannot put right the chaos and injustice Blair and Bush injected into the Middle East.</p> <p>Once we had revived our local Labour ward in Sheffield in 1980, its monthly attendance rose from the 12 pensioners and councillors that had kept it alive under Callaghan to maybe 30, one-third of whom were Trotskyists or sympathisers of the Communist party. And that was it. We achieved stuff – above all in supporting Sheffield city council when it resisted cuts. But ultimately the social forces that were driving Thatcherism were stronger. Thatcherism was the main event.</p> <p>The main event of 2016 – in England and Wales at least – is that 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. Sure, some of the same people are still around, including me, but it feels like a much bigger moment than the Benn insurgency. Anybody who thinks it is being driven, or “twisted”, by re-enactment groups from 20th-century Marxism is going to the wrong meetings.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","wordcount":"1081","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T12:03:38Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-15T10:43:02Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T12:03:38Z","internalComposerCode":"57b19cb6e4b062ce4d223816","internalOctopusCode":"11812228","internalPageCode":"2657245","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-17T13:23:25Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/5vvxd","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56628c7387010e54087c3b6c19ccebc6278a9798/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"43","internalShortId":"/p/5vvxd"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","webTitle":"The parallels between Jeremy Corbyn and Michael Foot are almost all false\r\n\r\n","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T12:03:38Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/the-parallels-between-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-foot-are-almost-all-false","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":"Labour leadership race","lastModified":"2016-08-17T12:20:32Z"}]}}
