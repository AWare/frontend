The former president of British Cycling has previously suggested that the International Olympic Committee look at non-Olympic events such as cyclo-cross and downhill mountain biking being part of the Winter Games, but now he believes a debate needs to be held on a whole raft of indoor events.</p><p>\"If you have a problem with summer Olympics where the whole thing is perceived as over-heated with too many facilities, too many sports, too many competitors and so on, why not look at moving some of the other sports that traditionally take place in the winter in the northern hemisphere indoors?\" Cookson said. \"So why not look at combat sports like judo, or other indoor sports like badminton. You could even say what about putting track cycling in the Winter Olympics?</p><p>\"If we moved track cycling to the Winter Olympics and that allowed us to have more track cycling events and more medals then that could be a pretty good outcome. So let's talk about those things and see what the stakeholders, the national federations, the teams and the competitors have to say about those options.\"</p><p>The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has announced a review of the whole Olympic programme with the results to be presented at a special session in Monaco at the end of this year. Cookson said cycling has enjoyed huge success in the Olympics but that sports' leaders should not just accept the status quo.</p><p>He added: \"If you look at the London Olympics the lesson from there is the cycling events were incredibly successful from the point of view of attendance and media coverage, and there were huge crowds for the road races. But we shouldn't just accept the status quo without thinking: 'What are the possibilities here.'</p><p>\"Thomas Bach has instituted a debate about the format for the Games and let's think about the Winter Olympics, why does it have to be snow and ice? The reality these days is that the base for the Winter Olympics the last few times has been two- or three-hours drive away from the mountains.\"</p><p>Cookson became the first person to successfully challenge a sitting president of a summer Olympic federation for more than 30 years when he unseated Ireland's Pat McQuaid last September. Since then he has unveiled a package of reforms of cycling including an independent investigation into allegations of a cover-up of doping by the UCI in the past, more financial transparency, and he is also backing term limits for the UCI presidency, making a maximum of eight or 12 years in office.</p><p>Cookson also warned that every sport needs to be aware that some of its athletes will be doping. He said: \"There are two categories of sport, those that have a doping problem and are trying to do something about it and cycling I would suggest is one of the leaders there.</p><p>\"The second category is those that have a doping problem and are in denial about it because there are forms of doping that affect all forms of sport. If you are running your sport and think that you don't have a doping problem then I think you need a wake-up call because there will be a form of doping that you need to do something about.\" <strong> </strong></p>","headline":"Brian Cookson calls for radical overhaul of Olympic events","trailText":"The president of cycling's governing body has said the IOC should consider switching some indoor events from the summer to the winter Games","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395765056284/UCI-newly-elected-preside-003.jpg","wordcount":"600","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T16:37:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/25/track-cycling-winter-olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/25/track-cycling-winter-olympic-games","tags":[{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics","webTitle":"Winter Olympics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/badminton","webTitle":"Badminton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/badminton","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/badminton","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432961673","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395765050279/UCI-newly-elected-preside-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Giampiero Sposito","altText":"UCI newly elected president Brian Cookson attends a news conference in Florence","height":"54","credit":"Giampiero Sposito/Reuters","caption":"The UCI president, Brian Cookson, has demanded a debate on changes to the Olympic Games.

pre-race favourites to sprint to the biggest victory of his career when he won the Milan-San Remo classic on Sunday.</p><p>The Katusha rider beat Fabian Cancellara (Trek), who came up just short at the end of a wet 299-km ride, although the 2008 winner from Switzerland finished on the podium for the fourth successive year.</p><p>\"I feel great, it's fantastic, I still have problems believing I won. I was hoping for a top-10 finish,\" said the 26-year-old Kristoff, who finished in the top 10 of the Tour of <sup></sup>Flanders, Milan-San Remo and Paris-Roubaix last year.</p><p>Britain's Ben Swift was third for Team Sky as the first of the season's five Monument one-day races ended with a reduced bunch sprint. \"It's amazing I only found out I was doing San Remo two weeks ago,\" said Swift. \"I felt good all day. It's just a shame that in the sprint I got boxed-in.\"</p><p>A planned change of route that would have affected the chances of several sprinters had been put on hold for a year, meaning Mark Cavendish and others had a genuine chance of winning when the race left Milan. However, the Briton, who won in 2009, started his sprint slightly too early and ran out of gas in the final metres, fading to fifth. The hot favourite Peter Sagan of Slovakia, who has yet to win a major classic race, never had a chance to attack and finished a disappointing 10th. Poland's Michal Kwiatkowski, one of the in-form riders early in the season, abandoned with about 50km remaining.</p><p>Rainy conditions had trimmed the peloton to some 60 riders at the foot of the Cipressa climb but neither Cancellara nor Sagan's teams were able to shake off the sprinters.</p><p>The Giro champion Vincenzo Nibali attacked in that climb despite the high pace set at the front of the peloton by Sagan's Cannondale team, but the Italian was reined in near the top of the Poggio, the last ascent of the day.</p><p>Several riders tried their luck solo, but after nearly 300km of racing nobody had the energy  to beat the pack.</p>","headline":"Milan-San Remo: Team Sky's Ben Swift is third behind Alexander Kristoff","trailText":"Team Sky's Ben Swift claimed a surprise third-placed finish in the first of the season's five Monument one-day races","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/23/1395596087973/Ben-Swift-006.jpg","wordcount":"348","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T17:37:58Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/23/milan-san-remo-ben-swift-alexander-kristoff","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/23/milan-san-remo-ben-swift-alexander-kristoff","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432791104","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/23/1395596076887/Ben-Swift-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon - Velo","altText":"Ben Swift","height":"54","credit":"Bryn Lennon - Velo/Getty Images","caption":"Ben Swift of Great Britain celebrates on the podium after the Milan-San Remo classic.

If the Manx Missile has an hour or so to spare on Saturday, he could do much worse than feed his appetite for cycling history by taking a short taxi ride to Milan's Vigorelli velodrome, which is open to the public this weekend as a prelude to the restoration with which it hopes to celebrate its 80th anniversary.</p><p>The wooden boards of the Vigorelli – once known to cycling fans as the <em>pista magica</em>, or magic track – have a matchless tale to tell. Opened in 1935, and distinguished by the Futurist architecture of its external structure, this was the site of several successful attempts on the one-hour record, track cycling's blue riband, first by the immortal Fausto Coppi in 1942. Countless epic two-wheeled battles, including the world championships of 1939, 1951, 1955 and 1962, were fought on its bankings.</p><p>But no cyclist has raced on the 397m track since 1999. In recent years the only sporting activity to take place within its precincts has been American football, on a pitch laid out on the infield, where the world's greatest riders once checked their chain tension and warmed up on their rollers. The board track, last relaid in 1992, is warped and rotten in places where the roof above the grandstands and the track has not kept off the rain.</p><p>Its history acknowledged only by the existence of a rather nondescript Vigorelli café on an adjacent street corner, the place became an embarrassment to the city. Plans for demolition were frequently announced, with offices and shops scheduled to spring up on the site. Last year those schemes nearly came true. But then, thanks to a group of energetic local enthusiasts who formed the Comitato Velodromo Vigorelli, an effective pressure was finally brought to bear.</p><p>This week's announcement that the municipal authorities had approved the renovation represented the final removal of a long-standing threat. The Vigorelli will retain its location, adjacent to a new development of three spectacular towers, whose developers will fund renovation costs estimated at around €5m.</p><p>The campaigners have stepped back from a relatively lavish original plan, which envisaged scrapping the old surface and building a new 250m track to Olympic standards. Under a more realistic Plan B, there will be a renovation of the existing track. The Vigorelli will be used not just for cycling but for boxing, and the gridiron footballers of the Milan Rhinos will be invited to stay, having played a part in keeping the place at least partially open. Other sports may eventually join them.</p><p>Those who visit this weekend will also see a plaque commemorating the Beatles' concert in the summer of 1965, the first date of the group's final European tour. The open days are sponsored by Italy's equivalent of English Heritage, an acknowledgement of the velodrome's value. They will also feature an exhibition of historic racing bikes, including the one on which Coppi set his record more than 70 years ago.</p><p>That bike has a special connection with the Vigorelli, since its steel frame was hand-made by a former racer named Faliero Masi in a workshop beneath one of the grandstands. Faliero is long dead, but his son Alfredo still maintains the premises, commissioned by collectors to restore his father's creations and occasionally using the old methods to satisfy an order for a new machine. The committee hopes that Masi, now 69, will stay on to greet visitors anxious for a glimpse of traditional skills that are once again in demand.</p><p>The efforts to preserve the Vigorelli were inspired by a similar campaign in recent years at Herne Hill, the velodrome used for the 1948 Olympic Games. Unlike the Milan track, South London's shallow-banked 450m concrete bowl, opened in 1891, never fell completely silent, but its continued existence was in doubt until a group called the Friends of Herne Hill stepped forward four years ago and devised a programme aimed at ensuring its survival in tandem, rather than in competition, with the new indoor Olympic velodrome a few miles north. Now the organisation has 600 members, the track has been resurfaced with the aid of a £200,000 grant from British Cycling, and planning permission is awaited for a new pavilion, designed by the architect of the 2012 Olympic velodrome, and already awarded £1.5m of funding from Sport England and the London Marathon Trust.</p><p>This week Herne Hill learned that its annual Good Friday meeting, first held in 1903 and attended by crowds of 10,000 in the days when the greats of cycling competed there, is being moved by its promoters to Stratford. There the racing will be safe from the Easter weather, the cause of cancellations in recent years. But if an open-air track of non-Olympic dimensions will never again be a centre for elite racing, that does not mean it cannot establish a new relevance.</p><p>Representatives of the Friends of Herne Hill and the Comitato Velodromo Vigorelli told me this week that their shared emphasis on community engagement is forming a basis for future co-operation. Plans are already advanced for the creation of a Network of Historic Velodromes, a project in which the Italian and English tracks hope to be joined by the Roubaix velodrome in France, a concrete bowl opened in 1895 and the scene of the finish of the annual Paris-Roubaix one-day race. Eventually they would like to be joined by other stadiums with similar histories and needs.</p><p>The secret is to identify a new role amid the explosion of interest in cycling. The romance of the past is fine, but only if it can be turned into a platform for a real engagement in the present. If Olympic medals and world records are no longer at stake, then these tracks remain ideal for giving newcomers their first taste of track racing. There will still be a Good Friday meeting at Herne Hill this year, but it will be a showcase for inter-schools races, for a disability cycling group, for women-only groups, for under-eights and over-40s, and others.</p><p>Imagine a future in which generations of young riders, having gained their initial experience at Herne Hill, the Vigorelli and Roubaix, travel to each other's tracks to compete for individual and team trophies. The volunteer campaigners who pursue this vision, using their commitment and imagination to fight off profiteers and overcome municipal inertia, are on to something very good indeed.</p>","headline":"Historic Vigorelli velodrome rescued by volunteers who fought off inertia","trailText":"<strong>Richard Williams:</strong> How an ageing velodrome has been saved by enthusiastic Italian volunteers who learned from English counterparts","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/21/1395404655281/Italian-Ercole-Baldini-co-002.jpg","wordcount":"1087","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T11:00:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/21/vigorelli-velodrome-rescued-volunteers-cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/21/vigorelli-velodrome-rescued-volunteers-cycling","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/richardwilliams","webTitle":"Richard Williams","rcsId":"GNL042351","r2ContributorId":"16336","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/2/1/1296557949182/Richard-Williams-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733747256/RichardWilliams.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Richard Williams is a former chief sports writer for the Guardian.

Riders and others involved in the sport, including coaches and team directors, have been promised reduced sanctions if they agree to co-operate.</p><p>Tygart said there were 37 redacted names in the original Armstrong judgment that it was in talks with the CIRC about handing over and said the names would become public if doping charges were eventually brought.</p><p>\"Just because you change the top the dirty system doesn't necessarily change and when you've got potentially doctors, team owners – I'm speculating on the evidence that we saw, on the co-conspirators that we charged and the evidence we obtained,\" added Tygart. \"When you've doped in the past with success, particularly as a doctor, team owner and coach, director, and you've never been exposed, the likelihood that you are going to continue that practice of doping and not getting caught is huge.\"</p><p>Martin Gibbs, the UCI director general who was appointed shortly after Cookson became president in September last year, said that the independent commission, headed by the Swiss politician Dick Marty, should be judged on results. \"We must not pretend it's already fixed. We are acutely aware we have to make a difference now in key areas with the independent commission,\" he said. \"We are a sport that has had an omerta about doping.\"</p><p>Tygart, who revealed that Usada had been in talks with Armstrong as recently as November about being involved with the process, said the Texan's refusal to co-operate need not undermine the CIRC. \"Most of the material and information that he has has already been brought out. I think it is unfortunate that he chose not to co-operate. Everyone deserves a second chance,\" said Tygart, speaking at the Tackling Doping in Sport conference at Wembley Stadium. \"From a reputational and a rehabilitation standpoint I hope that he comes in and helps clean up to the extent that his information is still valuable for that.</p><p>\"From a reputational stand point it would absolutely be the best thing for him.\"</p><p>Tygart said that he believed Armstrong became part of a \"sophisticated scheme to defraud\" by American business interests that may have found another way to flourish had the Texan not emerged as its standard-bearer.</p><p>\"This was a sophisticated scheme to defraud, they raised a lot of money, had incredible cash flow, and all based on victories in a sport and an incredible story,\" Tygart added. \"But I'm also not convinced it was just limited to an Armstrong story, I think American enterprise decided to come over and capitalise financially on the Tour de France in the US.\"</p>","headline":"Cycling running out of time to overhaul sport, warns anti-doping chief","trailText":"The man credited with exposing Lance Armstrong as a drug cheat has warned world cycling's governing body that it is running out of time to overhaul the sport","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395339521260/Travis-Tygart-US-Anti-Dop-004.jpg","wordcount":"637","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-23T18:35:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/20/cycling-overhaul-anti-doping-lance-armstrong-travis-tygart","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/20/cycling-overhaul-anti-doping-lance-armstrong-travis-tygart","tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/lance-armstrong","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/usada","webTitle":"Usada (United States Anti-Doping Agency)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/usada","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/usada","references":[]},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/owen_gibson_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.

Sky will attempt to determine what effect his living at altitude may have had on the readings.</p><p>The investigation into Henao was made public on Wednesday morning after La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the story through Henao's agent, and it means the British team now have two riders on gardening leave. Sky's British signing of last year, Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, has spent nearly six months awaiting the outcome of an anti-doping case into possible violations of the UCI's biological passport, which Team Sky have said date back to his time before he joined the squad.</p><p>The team principal Sir Dave Brailsford said on their website: \"Our experts had questions about Sergio's out-of-competition control tests at altitude – tests introduced this winter by the anti-doping authorities.\"</p><p>According to Sky, Henao returned to his home in Colombia last October and underwent out-of-competition tests. \"We need to understand these readings better. We want to do the right thing and we want to be fair. It's important not to jump to conclusions.\"</p><p>A Team Sky spokesman explained that the team has an internal panel, from both inside and outside the team, which examines the riders' data from external tests as part of their compliance process, and it is this system that has raised the questions over Henao.</p><p>On their website, Sky added that after last month's Tour of Oman, where he finished seventh, they contacted the UCI and Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation – the arm's length body which monitors anti-doping for the UCI – to see if it could offer any insights.</p><p>The UCI said it supported the move. \"As a matter of principle we are supportive of teams pursuing a policy of closely monitoring their athletes,\" a UCI spokesperson said. \"This is something that has been monitored by the team. This is their own programme and that's very important.\"</p><p>Brailsford added that the investigation into Henao will focus on the fact that he lives and trains at altitude, in common with many of the other Colombian cyclists in the professional peloton. His home at Rionegro, close to Medellin, is at 7,000 feet above sea level.</p><p>The performance-enhancing effects of taking riders to altitude are well known to Sky: training camps at altitude on Mount Teide in Tenerife formed a key part of both Bradley Wiggins' and Chris Froome's buildup to their Tour de France victories. What is less clear, the team feel, is the way those cyclists who are high-altitude \"natives\" function, which is why they are biding their time over Henao.</p><p>\"Sergio was raised in the mountains, goes back in winter and lives and trains at different levels,\" said Brailsford. \"We've looked as far as we can at the effects of this. Our understanding is limited by a lack of scientific research into 'altitude natives' such as Sergio. We are commissioning independent scientific research to better understand the effects of prolonged periods at altitude after returning from sea level, specifically on altitude natives.\"</p><p>Henao is expected to be out of commission for eight weeks, which means that he may still be available to start the Tour de France in July. He was expected to race the Dauphiné Libéré stage race in June and then possibly to make his debut in the Tour in support of Froome's title defence.</p>","headline":"Team Sky drop rider due to 'questions' over results of anti-doping tests","trailText":"<p>Team Sky have taken rider Sergio Henao off their race schedule due to \"questions\" overs the Colombian's results in out-of-competition, anti-doping tests</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395229591934/Sergio-Henao-004.jpg","wordcount":"583","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T09:53:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/19/team-sky-sergio-henao-anti-doping","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/19/team-sky-sergio-henao-anti-doping","tags":[{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432552407","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395222656834/Sergio-Henao-riding-for-T-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon - Velo","altText":"Sergio Henao riding for Team Sky in the 2014 Strade Bianchi","height":"84","credit":"Bryn Lennon - Velo/Getty Images","caption":"Sergio Henao riding for Team Sky in the 2014 Strade Bianchi.

With your help, perhaps I can<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>I’m not really the type of cyclist to have goals for the season, or even, frankly, a “season.” The bulk of my cycling is getting about or recreational, and while I do take part in organised events, these tend to be sportives rather than races – you end up with an officially recorded time but that’s not the main motivation.</p><p>But this year, with slight misgivings and fully reserving the right to change my mind, I’m setting myself a target: to complete the <a href=\"http://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/The_Events/Prudential_RideLondon-Surrey_100.htm\">100 miles of August’s Ride London event</a> in less than five hours. And I was hoping for your assistance.</p><p>For those who don’t know it, Ride London debuted last year as, the organisers hoped, a two-wheeled version of the London Marathon, with about 16,000 riders pedaling out of and back into the capital on closed roads a day after a shorter, family-oriented ride. </p><p>I was one of the participants, and frankly surprised the hell out of myself by completing the distance in five hours 20 minutes. Speed had never been a particular objective that day. I just got caught up in the excitement.</p><p>Lots of things went well. It was dry and sunny, but not overly hot, and with minimal wind. I didn’t suffer a puncture or any other mechanical mishaps. And I pushed myself, it felt in retrospect, about as hard as I could. That got me thinking: what would it take to beat that time, 12 months older and that bit more creaking and wheezy?</p><p>I’ve put a few of thoughts below, and I’d welcome your ideas on how I could productively use the next five months.</p><h2>More/better training</h2><p>This is the obvious answer, and the logical focus of my attention, but of course it’s never that simple. In the past I’ve tended to just go out for lots of rides, but time constraints – busy job, small child, the usual – means I must be more focused. I already have a turbo trainer, and will be hooking up a bike to it for various high-intensity sessions, but I’m still keen to hear tips on using my limited time efficiently. </p><h2>Expert advice</h2><p>As a follow-on for training, a few years ago when I was preparing for a multi-day mountain bike event I bought a cycle training manual and found it a bit impenetrable, over-keen for me to fill out ever more complex charts of my progress. This time I’ve read the hugely engaging if slightly more eccentric training book by Graeme Obree, but I’m still not that much the wiser. Any other tips?</p><h2>A better bike/other equipment</h2><p>This is somewhat theoretical – I’ve not got a spare pile of cash lying around – but it interests me nonetheless. My road bike is good but a bit elderly, a slightly aged and curious Klein Carbon Q, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=klein+carbon+q+road+bike&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=iMC&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4dYmU-v5AtGshQfLpIDICw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1519&amp;bih=1025#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=jH9FsUL0uhEwKM%253A%3BNQFx1PnjYi3eGM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ffcdn.mtbr.com%252Fattachments%252Fgeneral-discussion%252F59883d1109694302-post-your-road-bike-pictures-86new_bike_klein_q_carbon_team.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fforums.mtbr.com%252Fgeneral-discussion%252Fpost-your-road-bike-pictures-82458.html%3B800%3B600\">looking a bit like this</a>. It’s not the lightest or quickest bike out there, but I’m very used to it and it’s comfortable for long rides. Would any gains from a (theoretical) new bike be potentially undone by disadvantages such as unfamiliarity or discomfort?</p><p>Also, is anything else worth upgrading? My road shoes are a bit elderly and have stretched a touch – could this reduce the transfer of power in a sufficiently meaningful way to justify replacements? What else could give me an instant boost: better wheels or tyres?<br></p><h2>A bike fit</h2><p>Obree’s book is vocal about the importance of getting a bike of the right size and setup  (he’s especially keen on crank length). Like most riders, I imagine, all of this has been done purely on past experience and feel. How much difference, in theory, might some expert advice on this achieve?</p><h2>A cycle computer of some sort</h2><p>I used to use such a gadget but when it expired a couple of years ago I felt unexpectedly liberated from the tyranny of the tiny digits measuring my speed and slow-changing distance, preferring to concentrate instead on how much more my body felt it could push. Am I missing something?

Many of these are large-scale corporate events, such as Velofest in Kilnsey, high in the Dales, and the <a href=\"http://www.raphatempest.cc/\" title=\"\">Rapha Tempest</a> at Broughton Hall near Skipton.</p><p>But below the radar are several pop-ups from entrepreneurial locals. Prices and standards of these temporary campsites vary greatly – from fields with portaloos to sports club offering access to their facilities. Although all of them offer a parking-only option for those who don't fancy a night under canvas, roads along the route will be closed to motorised traffic throughout the day with travel severely restricted, so for the two Yorkshire stages spectators are advised to arrive at the campsites by Friday 4 July.</p><p>For stage three on 7 July, the race will start at midday from Parker's Piece in Cambridge, passing the university colleges of St John, Trinity and Kings, before leaving the city via Trumpington Road and heading for the Essex countryside and Epping Forest en route to London. It coincides with Cambridge's <a href=\"http://www.cambridgetouristinformation.co.uk/?p=1251\" title=\"\">Big Weekend</a> (5-7 July) a huge free celebration with music, food and all manner of entertainment. There are not yet as many pop-up campsites on this leg of the journey as in Yorkshire (news on timings and camping spots will be updated on <a href=\"theguardian.com/travel\" title=\"\">Guardian travel</a> as they become available).</p><p>But what this leg lacks in steep climbs it will makes up for in speed  and a spectacular sprint finish along the Mall in London.

England batsman on his Ashes departure, Murray Walker selects the tunes and Wiggo in the Archers, here's this week's ...","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2>... CRICKET DOCUMENTARY</h2><p>Surprise and speculation surrounded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/25/jonathan-trott-leaves-england-ashes-tour\" title=\"\">Jonathan Trott's departure from the Ashes tour last November</a> and not a little concern for the batsman's health, since clearly to leave a series of such weight after only one Test was not a decision taken lightly. He explains honestly and in detail what was happening at the time and what has transpired since to the former England batsman Ian Ward in <em>Jonathan Trott: Burn Out</em> on Sunday (Sky Sports 1, 7pm).</p><p>Trott describes a \"stress-related illness\" rather than depression of the type that led Marcus Trescothick to leave the 2006-07 Ashes tour. \"I was getting headaches and all sorts of things and I wasn't eating properly towards the end and that's when the sleep started getting disruptive and emotionally that was probably when I was worst and it just boiled over,\" Trott explains. \"I had nothing left in the tank or the battery – mentally and emotionally pretty drained.\" He goes on to detail his emotions on having left and fears over the public perception of his departure. \"People come up to you and say, 'It's good to see you're out and about' and I'm like: 'I'm not crazy I was just burnt out'.\" He intends to make his comeback for Warwickshire this season and is keen to return to the England squad.</p><p></p><h2>... CASTAWAY SELECTIONS</h2><p>Always a charming interviewee, with a warm manner that belies his excitable commentator persona, Murray Walker shares his choices for <em>Desert Island Discs</em> with Kirsty Young on Sunday (BBC Radio 4, 11.15am). Indeed, there is a wonderful moment when he switches from his normal tone to demonstrate how the action would move him. \"When I got excited and was standing up and I was bouncing about on the balls of my feet my [accelerates into classic Murray] voice would get a lot louder and much more aggressive and I would talk a lot faster because I was trying to communicate as much as I possibly could in the minimum amount of time ...\" Wonderful stuff.</p><p></p><h2>... CYCLING CLIMAX</h2><p>Geraint Thomas still has a shout at taking the win in the Paris-Nice race, which concludes on Sunday (Eurosport 3.15pm), Thomas relinquished the yellow jersey (when the race was first run in 1933 a rather more romantic blue and gold jersey, intended to evoke the Mediterranean sun, was used) in the sixth stage to Colombia's Carlos Betancur but before the final two stages was eight seconds back. The rider who won gold in the team pursuit at London 2012 is bidding to make it three wins in a row for Team Sky, the first hat-trick for a team since Laurent Jalabert did the triple for team ONCE between 1995 and 1997. Elsewhere, Mark Cavendish continues his attempt to win the Tirreno-Adriatico race that concludes on Tuesday (Eurosport, 1pm).</p><p></p><h2>... SPORT RELIEF MOMENTS</h2><p>Generally a slightly self-consciously wacky affair, this year's Sport Relief (Friday, BBC) offers two intriguing moments. David Beckham making a decent fist of acting in a special episode of <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> and possibly the highlight of any Sport Relief, ever, the mighty Wiggo making an appearance on <em>The Archers</em> (Friday, Radio&nbsp;4, 7pm) where he gets into some comic scrapes involving Lynda Snell's rusty bike ... Surely worth a donation on its own.</p>","headline":"Jonathan Trott on air, Bradley Wiggins in Ambridge and Murray memories","trailText":"<strong>The Agenda:</strong> Jonathan Trott on his Ashes departure, Murray Walker selects the tunes and Wiggo in the Archers","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/15/1394897527599/Jonathan-Trott-006.jpg","wordcount":"540","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-18T20:00:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/15/jonathan-trott-bradley-wiggins-murray-walker","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/15/jonathan-trott-bradley-wiggins-murray-walker","tags":[{"id":"sport/series/the-agenda","webTitle":"The Agenda","type":"series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/the-agenda","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/series/the-agenda","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/jonathan-trott","webTitle":"Jonathan Trott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jonathan-trott","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/jonathan-trott","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cricket","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilesrichards","webTitle":"Giles Richards","rcsId":"GNL509604","r2ContributorId":"15668","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/11/3/1320345898516/Giles-Richards-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Richards is a senior journalist for the Guardian, the Observer and the Guardian.co.uk <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport\">sports</a> desk</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesrichards","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/gilesrichards","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/sport","webTitle":"Observer Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432171928","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/15/1394897515677/Jonathan-Trott-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Anthony Devlin","altText":"Jonathan Trott","height":"54","credit":"Anthony Devlin/PA","caption":"Jonathan Trott talks openly about his withdrawal from the Ashes tour last year on Sky Sports on Monday.

The race takes place on The Mound, with the initial 500 cyclists whittled down to 30 for the main event; these 30 then compete against 10 of the UK's top cyclists, which makes this a dream opportunity for anyone who believes they could give the champs a run for their money. <br />• <em>The Mound, </em><a href=\"http://www.redbull.com/uk/en/bike/events/1331635102219/red-bull-hill-chasers-2014\" title=\"\"><em>redbull.com/Red-Bull-Hill-Chasers</em></a></p><h2>UCI BMX Supercross World Cup, Manchester: 18-19 April</h2><p>Featuring the world's best BMX riders, the Supercross cup features crashes, jumps and drama of the kind you will never see at a road cycling event. It's held at the National Cycling Centre – Britain's first indoor Olympic cycling track. The venue was expanded in 2011 to include a new £19m BMX track, which sees riders launch themselves down an eight-metre- high Supercross ramp to start each race. <br />• <em>National Cycling Centre, Stuart Street, 0161 223 2244, </em><a href=\"http://bmxsuperx.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bmxsuperx.com</em></a></p><h2>Giro d'Italia Big Start, Belfast-Dublin: 9-11 May</h2><p>While the Tour de France is making history with the Grand Départ in Yorkshire, the Giro d'Italia – an epic annual tour around Italy – is doing much the same this May when it kicks off in Northern Ireland. Over three days cyclists will power through stages taking them through Belfast, along the Causeway Coast and then from Armagh to Dublin. It's a spectacular route through beautiful countryside, and thousands of spectators are expected to line the roads to watch the riders. The run-up to the start will also see a host of special events before the arrival of over 200 of the world's top professional cyclists who are competing this year.<br />• <em><a href=\"http://www.girostart2014.com/\">girostart2014.com</a></em></p><h2>UCI Mountain Bike World Cup, Fort William: 7-8 June</h2><p>Although the 4X event, in which four bikers race down a jump-filled track, features plenty of hair-raising moments, the climax of the Mountain Bike World Cup will undoubtedly be the downhill, in which athletes with nerves of steel let gravity drag them down a steep course of challenging and technical features. British riders rank well in both disciplines, so medal chances are high for the hosts. Getting up close to the action will make for a fantastic day out, with fans lining the tracks to shout, cheer and even play the bagpipes in support of the riders.<br />• <a href=\"http://fortwilliamworldcup.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>fortwilliamworldcup.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>L'Eroica: 20-22 June</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432017443'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394645612854/Granfondo-Eroica-bicycle--011.jpg' alt='Granfondo Eroica bicycle race Gaiole In Chianti Tuscany Italy' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Granfondo L'Eroica bicycle race, Tuscany, Italy Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Expect to see drop-down handlebars and handlebar moustaches at this vintage derby dubbed \"The most handsome bike race in the world\". <a href=\"http://en.eroica.it/\">An annual event held in Tuscany since 1997</a>, this year is the first time the event has come to the UK and it will consist of a three-day bike festival in the Peak District, celebrating classic cycling style as much as the act of riding itself - all entrants must be riding a pre-1987 road bike with gear shifters on the down tube of the frame. \"Adventurers\" can choose a 30-, 50- or 100-mile route along beautiful trails that will only serve to accentuate further the organiser's justifiably rose-tinted view of the sport.<br />• <em>Bakewell, Derbyshire, 07943 533667, </em><a href=\"http://www.eroicabritannia.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>eroicabritannia.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Tour de France, Yorkshire's Grand Départ: 5-6 July</h2><p>Sir Bradley Wiggins' and Chris Froome's historic victories have helped spread Tour de France fever around the country, but Britain's new-found fervour for competitive cycling looks set to continue this summer when the race kicks off in Yorkshire. It will be the first time the race has ventured to the north of England and two stages will take place there, taking riders through the Dales from Leeds to Harrogate, and then from York to Sheffield, before the Tour moves south for a third stage from Cambridge to London.<br />• <a href=\"http://letour.yorkshire.com/the-grand-d%C3%A9part-2014\" title=\"\"><em>letour.yorkshire.com</em></a></p><h2>The Dunwich Dynamo: 12 July</h2><p>This cult cycling phenomenon sees thousands of riders race through the night from London Fields in Hackney to the Suffolk coast. Originally the idea of a small group of cycle couriers (who did the ride on their \"fixies\"), the event now sees around 2,000 participants – with many taking part on highly impractical bicycles, including a Boris bike and a penny farthing. The easygoing event encourages cyclists of all abilities to take part and there are feed stops along the way – more recently in the form of pop-up stalls in people's front gardens. <br /><a href=\"http://www.sportive.com/events/dunwich-dynamo-sportive-2014/2014-07-12/532/cycling\" title=\"\"><em>sportive.com/dunwich-dynamo-sportive</em></a></p><h2>Prudential RideLondon: 9-10 August</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432017444'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394645888647/Prudential-RideLondon-011.jpg' alt='Prudential RideLondon' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>An annual world-class cycling festival that's another legacy of the 2012 Olympics, RideLondon brings together cyclists of all abilities for a weekend of races, fun rides and spectating. The FreeCycle event on the Saturday sees around 50,000 riders enjoy a traffic-free tour around London past landmarks including Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, while the Grand Prix showcases the country's future Olympic champions. Those looking for a more serious ride can take part in the RideLondon Surrey 100 race, a long-distance ride on closed roads out of the capital and into the countryside before finishing with a spectacular sprint down the Mall.<br />• <a href=\"http://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>prudentialridelondon.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>South West Tour Ride Sportive: 5 September</h2><p>For those set on racing a stage of a professional bike race (and who really don't want to make it easy for themselves), the South West Tour Ride takes you on the longest and hardest stage of this year's Tour of Britain. The 175km coast-to-coast ride takes competitors through exhausting hill terrain in the West Country, with ascents to challenge even the most experienced rider. The stage can be ridden as a \"pro\" or \"challenge\" sportive, and there's a lighter option for the family involving laps of a 1.5km circuit around Teignmouth. <br />• <a href=\"http://www.tourride.co.uk/home.php#.UyBKt0J_tOg\" title=\"\"><em>tourride.com</em></a></p><h2>Wiggle Etape Cymru, Wrexham: 14 September</h2><p>Pitched as the UK's toughest closed-road sportive, Etape Cymru is an \"epic\", \"lung-busting\" and \"leg-aching\" way to finish the season. Taking its riders through the Clwydian Range and Dee valley in north Wales, the event includes one stage that sees cyclists race 6.1km up a climb that gains 317 metres in height and has a gradient that reaches 20% at its hardest points. If you can't hack it, there are plenty of pubs along the route where you can cheer on the race's hardy competitors. <br />• <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/etape-cymru\" title=\"\"><em>humanrace.co.uk/etape-cymru</em></a></p><p><hr /><br /><strong>FESTIVALS</strong></p><h2>Grand Depart cultural festival, Yorkshire: until 6 July</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432017441'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394727355445/Yorkshire-Cultural-Festiv-008.jpg' alt='Yorkshire Cultural Festival' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Yorkshire Festival will include the \"Ghost Peoloton\", a dance-art collaboration in which 50 cyclists will don LED light suits</figcaption></figure><p>Maximising the opportunity offered by the Tour de France visiting the north of England, Yorkshire is putting on a 100-day cultural festival in the run-up to the Grand Départ.

The event is the go-to exhibition for city-cycle enthusiasts, with brands from Brooks to Espresso, Foffa to Moulton all pitching up to display their finest wares. Some of the most forward-thinking cycling brands will be there, such as the Swedish designers behind <a href=\"http://www.hovding.com/en/how_it_works/\" title=\"\">Hovding: the world's first airbag for cyclists</a>, also known as the \"invisible helmet\", while DJs including 6 Music's Gideon Coe will keep feet tapping throughout.<br />• <em>Old Truman Brewery, London, </em><a href=\"http://spinldn.com/\" title=\"\"><em>spinldn.com</em></a></p><h2>Bespoked – The UK Handmade Bicycle Show, London: 11-13 April</h2><p>If you're after some eye-candy, this festival is where you can expect to find the kinds of bicycles you dream of. Beautiful custom-builds from a range of exhibitors are on display, highlighting the skill and craft that goes into frame building and handmade components. It's a chance to meet the passionate people who make these high-end bikes and try them out, and there will be talks from builders and riders.

Among the events are the Bike Slam – the world's first-ever cycling poetry slam – as well as a series of photography exhibitions, cycle films and, of course, plenty of rides. It's a non-profit event, so all the money made will be distributed to Edinburgh-based cycling organisations.<br />• <em>Various locations, </em><a href=\"http://www.edfoc.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>edfoc.org.uk</em></a></p><h2>Orbital cycling festival, Chichester: 26-27 July</h2><p>A festival of road, MTB and track racing brought together at the iconic motorsports venue that is the Goodwood Circuit. As well as plenty of racing and rides, the festival includes bike displays from trick riders, an expo showing all the latest gear and a bike jumble and local producers' market. There's a campsite and live music and DJs to keep things lively in the evenings. A highlight for 2014 will be the Orbital Meander: a 40km ride around the local countryside, taking in local food and drink producers and landmarks.<br />• <em>Goodwood Motor Circuit, Chichester, </em><a href=\"http://www.orbitalfestival.com/\" title=\"\"><em>orbitalfestival.com</em></a></p><h2>Isle of Wight cycling festival, 13-28 September</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432017445'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394646099751/The-cycle-cinema-at-the-I-009.jpg' alt='The cycle cinema at the Isle of Wight Cycling Festival' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cycle cinema at the Isle of Wight cycling festival</figcaption></figure><p>This family-friendly festival features a programme of around 60 rides to suit all ages and abilities.

You wait years for one to come along, and then you get two, one right after the other. Two British victors of cycling's toughest event back to back might seem an outlandish idea, but Dave Brailsford, Team Sky, Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins have managed to make it seem routine at the same time.</p><p>In July 2009, Team Sky was merely a series of spreadsheets, random jottings, and what the team's founders term \"brain dumps\" as Brailsford and his associates tried to figure out how to start a professional cycling team. They had little idea of what they were getting into. But this July Froome started as the overwhelming Tour favourite, led the race from the end of week one, and never looked likely to be beaten. Wiggins did exactly the same in 2012.</p><p>It has taken four years, but that is not a coincidence: four years is an Olympic cycle, the time frame in which British Cycling, the UK's governing body, and its performance director, Brailsford, have tended to function since the arrival of lottery funding into the sport in 1997. Britain's Tour de France domination stems directly from its record Olympic medal hauls, which drew in the big money from Sky – James Murdoch is an active cyclist and turns up to races intermittently – and gave Brailsford the knowledge base from which to climb cycling's Everest: the Tour.</p><p>The Sky goal was to dominate road cycling using the same methods that had brought Olympic success, most notably the \"aggregation of marginal gains\", where every area is examined in minute detail for possible improvement, and the cumulative effect of many small gains gives a considerable advance on the opposition. Sky would also use the people-management principles devised by Steve Peters, the \"mechanic of the mind\", a psychiatrist who had worked at Rampton mental hospital.</p><p>The first year was a struggle. The \"marginal gains\" that Sky brought to cycling initially made it the butt of derision. Its special set-up at time-trial stages, with non-slip matting laid out so the cyclists wouldn't slip in their custom-made carbon-fibre soled shoes, took hours to set up – and other teams would laugh at them as they toiled away.</p><p>Attempts to use weather modelling to locate training camps and decide Wiggins' start time in a Tour time trial fell spectacularly flat. Staff would moan about the extra effort it took lugging the riders' custom-made bedding in and out of hotels every night. There were tensions among riders and staff, with European hirings struggling to fit in with British Cycling's methods. Key members left; there were complaints about constant meetings.</p><p>The ridicule and mutterings lasted only as long as it took for Sky to start winning, and since the end of 2011 it has been a trail of success, not just in the Tour but in other stage races. By then Sky's training guru, Tim Kerrison, had begun putting together a radical programme that is at the root of Wiggins and Froome's successes: intense training at high altitude, reverse periodisation, which turned the idea of a gradual buildup to the Tour on its head, less racing and more training.</p><p></p><p>Rod Ellingworth, Sky's performance manager, and Kerrison put together a method of internal communication based on dropboxes, to compensate for the fact that Sky's 80 personnel were spread around Europe. Advanced planning and logistical systems were put in place. More training staff were hired, so that, uniquely in professional cycling, Sky's riders benefit from one-to-one training on a constant basis. \"You can see from this team how much you can get by investing relatively small amounts in coaching,\" Kerrison has told the Guardian. \"The gains are disproportionate.\"</p><p></p><p>Kerrison's computer modelling of the Tour's athletic demands meant the team could target precisely what training was needed to win the Tour.</p><p>There has been no let-up on the marginal gains front. The team's dietitian, Nigel Mitchell, has been a constant presence on the race, monitoring every gram the riders consume, including the fish oils, and fruit and vegetable shakes that are Sky staples. The fruits of Froome's work in a wind tunnel could be seen in his time-trial success and in the bursts of speed on the climbs that won him the race. And the Olympic link is as strong as ever: two of Sky's key team members, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh, were gold medallists at the \"Pringle\" in London.</p><p>On Saturday, Froome spoke about his personal journey to Tour de France success, from pounding dirt tracks in Kenya as a teenager when he was unaware La Grande Boucle even existed. But the voyage taken by Brailsford and his cohorts from callow tyros to Tour tyrants is equally remarkable. The Sky head said before the Tour that in 2010 he would have given his right arm to see one of his cyclists make the podium in a major Tour; now the cycling world is scrabbling to catch up.</p>","headline":"Tour de France: how Team Sky climbed to the top and stayed there","trailText":"Back-to-back victories for Britain's Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins will realise Sky's aim of

When I was at school I&nbsp;wanted to go to the Côte d'Azur for holidays, like my schoolfriends. We went to the North Sea. My father, who was a grocer and one of 11 children, said: \"Don't look to those who go to the Côte D'Azur, but look to those who can't go the North Sea – keep your feet on the ground.\"</p><p><strong>I wanted to be a cyclist</strong> from the age of four. I listened to the Tour de France on the radio during the holidays. My teachers said: \"That's not a job\", but I was the Belgian amateur champion at 16 [he won 445 races as a pro].</p><p><strong>My earliest memory</strong> is my first crash on a&nbsp;bike. It was when I was four. My legs were going faster and faster until, in the end, they couldn't keep up with the pedals and I&nbsp;crashed spectacularly.</p><p><strong>The closest I have come to death</strong> was when I had my crash at the Blois outdoor vélodrome in central France in September 1969. I'd just won the Tour de France and I&nbsp;was racing behind my pacer, who was on a&nbsp;Derny [a custom-built motorbike]. He&nbsp;crashed into another bike and was killed. I&nbsp;hit him at full speed. I flew through the air, landing head first. I&nbsp;had nothing on my head – just sponge and leather. I twisted my hips and injured my back and I was never the same. I&nbsp;was always in pain, and still have treatment on my back every two months.</p><p><strong>I heard Sir </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/21/bradley-wiggins-never-ride-tour-de-france-again\" title=\"\"><strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong></a> made £6m last year. I'm not jealous about that, because I&nbsp;don't understand why cyclists aren't paid as much as footballers or tennis players or golfers, but if I could have made £6m in a&nbsp;year I wouldn't have ridden as much. You had to ride a lot back then to make money. When I started, I got a jersey and some equipment. Sometimes I would get the equivalent of €25 to enter a race and €15 prize money.</p><p><strong>I don't know how many races</strong> I was in over the years [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/16/eddy-merckx-william-fotheringham-review\" title=\"\">Merckx</a> competed in 1,413 races from 1966-77], but in 1975, the year I lost  the Tour de France, I did 195 races. I was racing everywhere.</p><p><strong>They called me the Cannibal.</strong> It was a&nbsp;young girl, the daughter of my old Peugeot teammate Christian Raymond, who gave me the name. We were on the start line and Christian said to her: \"This guy won't let us win anything – he wants everything for himself.\" She said: \"So he's a cannibal.\"</p><p><strong>When you are number one, </strong>the pressure is on you. It's not only physical but mental. You&nbsp;become tired.</p><p><strong>Cycling is a good school for life.</strong> It makes you hard and gives you ambition, but you can never say you've arrived.</p><p><strong>I don't like it when people say </strong>I was the best ever. It's silly. I am not the best ever. I was the best of my time. You cannot compare generations. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/may/31/fausto-coppi\" title=\"\">Fausto Coppi</a> after the war, Anquetil, Hinault, Indurain, Fignon. I&nbsp;never rode for the glory. I rode because I&nbsp;like cycling and winning. But not to say I am the best.</p><p><strong>I made a big mistake in 1975</strong>, when I had a&nbsp;crash in the Tour de France and broke my jaw [he was also punched by a spectator but still finished second]. I should have retired from the race. I was exhausted.</p><p><strong>I am 68, but still ride every week</strong> with some friends, maybe 60km at a time, but we enjoy a glass of wine and some parma ham afterwards.</p>","headline":"Eddy Merckx: this much I know","trailText":"<p>The five-time winner of the Tour de France talks about a lifetime in the saddle, why he didn't race for glory and why he isn't jealous of today's winning cheques, says <strong>Andy Pietrasik</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372247892897/Cycling---Eddy-Merckx-003.jpg","wordcount":"590","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-02T18:30:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/29/eddy-merckx-this-much-i-know","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/29/eddy-merckx-this-much-i-know","tags":[{"id":"lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","webTitle":"This much I know","type":"series","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andypietrasik","webTitle":"Andy Pietrasik","r2ContributorId":"19142","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/andy_pietrasik1_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andy Pietrasik is head of travel at the Guardian.

The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p>","headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Mulligan</strong> watches Jacques Goddet preside over the annual national jamboree that is the Tour de France</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335911794/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-005.jpg","wordcount":"684","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-27T11:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","webTitle":"From the Observer archive","type":"series","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-411915569","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335908050/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Popperfoto","photographer":"Robert Delvac","altText":"Sunbathing Tour de France spectators","height":"54","credit":"Robert Delvac/Popperfoto","caption":"Sunbathers cheer passing riders on the sixth stage of the Tour de France near Quimper.

Bradley will return to the UK today for treatment and to rest and we hope to have him back on the road as soon as possible.</p><p>\"As a passionate racer he wanted to continue but he is simply unable to do so on medical grounds.\"</p><p>Team Sky had said that a decision would be taken first thing on Friday depending primarily on Wiggins's health but also on the weather, as further rain would be certain to affect him adversely. Rain was forecast for Friday morning in Emilia Romagna, the location of the stage start, together with winds gusting to 40km/h.</p><p>The risk was that by continuing to pursue what had become a lost cause, Wiggins might create more problems for his health in the long term. A prompt withdrawal at least means he can return for the Tour de France; there are opportunities for him to return to competition before then, including the Tour of Switzerland in late June, but the team will wait for a complete recovery before deciding on his programme.</p><p>Wiggins had made the sign of the cross to cycling fans at the finish of Wednesday's stage in Fruili; even though he was able to hang on to the leaders, he admitted that he had been ill for several days and had been taking antibiotics. He had limited his time loss on the first severe mountain-top finish of the race on Tuesday to just 37sec, inspiring hopes that he might still tilt for the podium.</p><p>The most likely cause for Wiggins's sickness is the rough weather which has followed the Giro as it has travelled from the south of the country to the north. While some cyclists thrive in the wet and cold, Wiggins has always been open about the fact that he is susceptible to such conditions.</p><p>The wet weather hit the Giro 10 days ago, on stage four, and Thursday was the fourth stage run in rain and cold; Wiggins had lost time on stages four and seven in the grim conditions. The forecast for the weekend's Alpine stages is for snow, with speculation that Sunday's finish on the Galibier will be cut short.</p><p>Wiggins was not the only winner of a Grand Tour from 2012 to quit the race; before the Briton's departure was confirmed, Garmin-Sharp announced that Hesjedal would not start Friday's stage. The Canadian had suffered immensely on Tuesday's stage in Friuli, and like Wiggins, the three-hour run on to the Veneto plains on Thursday proved too much for him.</p><p>\"There's a virus that's been going around, so it could be that, or severe allergies – whatever it is, I'm only getting worse,\" said Hesjedal in a statement released by his team. \"Yesterday's stage was just too much for me, I fought to get through it but after seeing the medical staff last night, I also know that its time for me to go home, get some tests done and get healthy again.</p>","headline":"Bradley Wiggins leaves Giro d'Italia","trailText":"Olympic gold medal cyclist to return home to recover from severe cold and chest infection that had left him lying 13th","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368775006804/Bradley-Wiggins-at-the-st-005.jpg","wordcount":"591","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-05-20T07:17:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/17/bradley-wiggins-leaves-giro-ditalia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/may/17/bradley-wiggins-leaves-giro-ditalia","tags":[{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/giro-d-italia-2013","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia 2013","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/giro-d-italia-2013","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/giro-d-italia-2013","references":[]},{"id":"sport/giro-d-italia","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/giro-d-italia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/giro-d-italia","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-409034174","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368775003130/Bradley-Wiggins-at-the-st-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Gian Mattia D'Alberto","altText":"Bradley Wiggins at the start of Thursday's 12th stage of the Giro d'Italia","height":"54","credit":"Gian Mattia D'Alberto/AP","caption":"Bradley Wiggins at the start of Thursday's 12th stage of the Giro d'Italia on which he was left behind by the peloton.

Hoy has been a proud Scot all his career and it seems entirely typical of that he should choose to make his official farewell not far away from the mouldering old wooden Commonwealth Games stadium at Meadowbank, where he made his debut in track cycling in the&nbsp;early 1990s.</p><p>Since 7 August, when he won keirin gold in London and was saluted as he left the boards by a guard of honour consisting of all the Great Britain team staff, Hoy has officially been contemplating his future with a view to continuing as far as the Commonwealth Games next year in Glasgow, at the new velodrome which has been named after him. That decision, he said last November, would depend on whether he felt his body would hold out.</p><p>Senior figures within British Cycling have, however, felt recently that he would be hanging up his wheels some time this year. One indication that he would be quitting competition came in the last few weeks when his press officer Charlie Reid, who has run his media engagements since the Beijing Games, was quietly moved to other duties.</p><p>Hoy has also been dealing with his newly launched bike range, and motor racing. Nothing has pointed to a resumption of training. At the world championships in Minsk in February, it was clear that the British sprint staff were looking for a new rider to take over Hoy's place in the team sprint.</p><p>It seems likely that Hoy has made the decision on two grounds: first, he is unlikely to make a better farewell than his spectacular gold medal in the keirin in London. If he were to continue to Glasgow next August, there would be a risk that a younger opponent might show him up. Given the reputation of the track head coach Shane Sutton for plain speaking, this may well have been&nbsp;put to him.</p><p>Also, in the runup to London, Hoy's body was buckling. It was kept quiet – for obvious reasons – but the updated version of his autobiography published after the Games made it clear that he was carrying a back injury between the world championships in Melbourne in April, and the Olympics.</p><p>Between Beijing and London he also broke a rib while weight training, and had a big crash at the Copenhagen World&nbsp;Cup in February 2009 that injured&nbsp;his hip.</p><p>Hoy's departure will mark the end of an era: he is one of the last members of the Olympic cycling team who competed in the distant era before lottery funding arrived in 1997 to transform the sport. He was one of a group of sprinters, together with Jason Queally and Craig Maclean, who were given funding soon after lottery cash arrived, and they broke through at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 with a silver medal in the team sprint to go with Queally's gold in the kilometre time trial. Since then he has spearheaded the British squad's rise to world domination.</p><p>Hoy's first world titles came in 2002 in Copenhagen, where he triumphed in the kilometre, and he followed that up with gold at the discipline in the Athens Olympics. When the time trial was dropped from the Olympic programme he reinvented himself as a keirin and match-sprint rider in time for Beijing, using his immense strength to ride from the front in a dominating style that was completely novel at the time.</p><p>That earned him a spectacular hat-trick of gold medals at the Beijing Games, which in turn led to his election as BBC Sports Personality of the Year for&nbsp;2008. By this stage he was established as the father figure in the British track team, seen as the exemplar of commitment and discipline, as well as ultra-competitiveness, which was the template for the younger squad members.</p><p>By the run-in to London, Hoy's position in the match sprint was under threat from Beijing silver medallist Jason Kenny, and the younger man was given the nod in June.</p><p>But in April, Hoy had taken his fourth keirin world title in six years, showing when he emerged from the pack in a daring move on the final banking that he had broadened his skills, and could now win from almost anywhere on the track.</p><p>That epic moment set up what now looks to have been the final flourish, the&nbsp;highlight of the London velodrome racing in August. If Hoy confirms his departure on Thursday, that will have been one hell of an exit, befitting one of&nbsp;the greatest British Olympians.</p><h2>Hoy's golds</h2><p><strong>Olympic Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Athens 2004 </strong>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Beijing 2008 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff); keirin; sprint</p><p><strong>London 2012 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes); keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>World Championships</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2002 </strong>1km time trial; team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Staff)</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2004</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Los Angeles 2005</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Jason Queally and Staff)</p><p><strong>Bordeaux 2006</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Palma 2007</strong></p><p>Keirin, 1km time trial</p><p><strong>Manchester 2008</strong></p><p>Sprint, keirin</p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2010</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2012</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>Commonwealth Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Manchester 2002</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2006</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Ross Edgar, and Craig MacLean)</p><p></p><p>Hoy has also achieved one Olympic silver medal, eight World Championship silver medals and nine world championship bronze medals.</p>","headline":"Chris Hoy to retire from cycling after 13 years on top","trailText":"Olympian who spearheaded British dominance in the sport expected to quit after remarkable career in the velodrome","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/15/1366046430631/Chris-Hoy-005.jpg","wordcount":"909","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-04-18T17:42:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/chris-hoy-retire-cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/apr/15/chris-hoy-retire-cycling","tags":[{"id":"sport/chrishoy","webTitle":"Sir Chris Hoy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/chrishoy","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/sport","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-407237842","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/15/1366046425836/Chris-Hoy-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Tom Jenkins","altText":"Chris Hoy","height":"54","credit":"Tom Jenkins","caption":"Chris Hoy celebrates winning the sixth Olympic gold of his career in the keirin final at London 2012, his swansong.

cycling group hopes to build on 2012's track success to get UK pedalling up European tables of bike use","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>It was a mantra heard time and again amid the cosy fug of 2012's British sporting success: with a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/22/bradley-wiggins-tour-de-france-cavendish\" title=\"\">Tour de France title</a>, another <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/cycling-track/medals/\" title=\"\">clutch of Olympic golds</a> and Bradley Wiggins <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/17/bradley-wiggins-sports-personality-year\" title=\"\">our sports personality of the year</a>, we were now officially a nation of cyclists.</p><p>Except we're not. Exclude racing or tourism and Britons are near the bottom of just about every European cycling ranking. Just 2.2% of people use a bike as their main means of transport, lower than all but a handful of EU nations such as Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus.</p><p>Other statistics are equally damning. About 2% of British children ride to school, compared with 40% in Denmark and 20% in Sweden. Almost three-quarters of British cyclists are men, a statistic that speaks of a macho, gung-ho cycling culture where riders are expected to mix it with speeding cars, buses and trucks.</p><p>\"When it comes to cycling as everyday transport the UK is so far down the table it's almost scary,\" said Kevin Mayne, director of development at the Brussels-based <a href=\"http://www.ecf.com/\" title=\"\">European Cyclists' Federation</a>. \"With all these Olympic medals people maybe have this idea that the UK is doing OK in cycling. But it's not.\"</p><p>And yet cycling advocates hope things could be about to change. This week is the start of a <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/inquiry/\" title=\"\">pioneering parliamentary inquiry</a> into how best to get Britons on their bikes, building on the momentum from last summer's sporting triumphs and an <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/\" title=\"\">energetic cycle safety campaign by the Times</a>. All three main party leaders have signed up. Expectations are growing that Downing Street could be on the verge of making a significant commitment.</p><p>\"It's all to play for,\" said Roger Geffen, policy director of national cycling lobby group the <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CTC</a> and among those giving evidence to the <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary cycling group</a> (APPCG) of MPs and peers, which has organised the hearings. \"The inquiry is hugely timely and hopefully it paves the way for some sort of high-level announcement from government.\"</p><p>The first of the inquiry's six evidence sessions starts on Wednesday, taking the views of experts, government departments, cycling luminaries such as the Olympic champion-turned bike builder <a href=\"http://www.boardmanbikes.com/boardman/index.html\" title=\"\">Chris Boardman</a> and members of the media, including the Guardian. It is hoped David Cameron or Nick Clegg will appear.</p><p>Ian Austin, the Labour MP for Dudley North who co-chairs the APPCG, said the plan was to turn 2012's generalised rhetorical enthusiasm into definite commitments. \"We want a detailed report with some very clear recommendations, which we can then ask all the political parties to sign up to. If we can get the party leaders to commit to cycling in advance of the election we can make some real progress.\"</p><p>It has long been a policy truism that more cycling is good for all: carbon emissions fall, road congestion eases, people get fitter. Equally accepted is how to bring this about, using a template devised by the Dutch and Danes and tested in dozens of cities.</p><p>To get cycling mainstream, experts agree, you need wholesale investment in infrastructure, most obviously well-designed and continuous cycle lanes, separated from faster traffic by a kerb or other barrier and with cyclists offered protection at junctions. The philosophy was summed up by <a href=\"http://www.enriquepenalosa.com/\" title=\"\">Enrique Peñalosa</a>, who as mayor of Bogotá revolutionised transport in the Colombian capital: \"A bicycle way that is not safe for an eight-year-old is not a bicycle way.\"</p><p>Without this, according to Mayne, cycling never expands beyond an intrepid core of mainly young, predominantly male riders: \"The studies show you more or less never drop below 1% of people who cycle, and this can rise to maybe 5% or 6% without infrastructure. But anything more than this needs the cyclists catered for. That means high-quality lanes, probably segregated on main highways. It means speed management, massive investment in cycle parking so every cycling trip is possible. It certainly means getting hugely behind women and children cycling.\"</p><p>Such a commitment has been beyond the imagination, let alone daring, of successive British governments faced by a powerful and aggressive motoring lobby and a wider public who, studies show, still largely see cycling as a leisure pursuit or worse, see a bike as a child's toy.</p><p>It would require considerable investment. In a paper submitted to the inquiry, <a href=\"http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/aldred-rachel\" title=\"\">Rachel Aldred</a>, a London academic specialising in cycling, estimated a cost of just over £1.1bn a year for cycling to even begin the process of catching up with other nations, seemingly a lot but marginal set against the £16bn cost of just one rail project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/29/crossrail-train-manufacturing-contract\" title=\"\">Crossrail</a>.</p><p>\"Relatively, cycling is extraordinarily cheap,\" said Mayne. \"Cycling schemes routinely pay back their investment in one to three years. Your average road scheme pays back on paper in 20 years but usually doesn't pay back at all. You can hit your climate change targets, your health targets, everything else. It's a no-brainer.\"</p><p>While Britain is littered with bike lanes they are almost universally piecemeal and substandard, often just a narrow strip of paint inches from speeding traffic. London and a handful of other places, notably Brighton and Southampton, are now <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/cycling/cs5\" title=\"\">proposing limited Dutch-style segregated schemes</a>. More of the same is vital, according to Mayne: \"If you're given a fixed amount of money do you do one thing well or lots of things badly? You do the one thing well. If you spend every penny you've got on a high-quality segregated lane it will attract people and you can build confidence on that route.\"</p><p>Geffen, however, argues that even poorly designed lanes have a purpose in gradually building up cyclist levels to a point where the momentum of opinion is sufficient to begin making bold choices.</p><p>\"Good infrastructure is vital but even that only goes so far,\" said Geffen. \"At some point, if you're going to have room for all these new bikes and bikes lanes, you have to start talking about ways to reduce traffic levels. That's where delivering on cycling really gets difficult.\"</p>","headline":"Cycling in Britain: government to get serious with all-party inquiry","trailText":"<p>Parliamentary cycling group hopes to build on 2012's track success to get UK pedalling up European tables of bike use</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/20/1358687786110/Woman-cycles-in-London-tr-005.jpg","wordcount":"970","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-23T13:17:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/20/cycling-in-britain-government-inquiry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jan/20/cycling-in-britain-government-inquiry","tags":[{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/transport","references":[]},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/health","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/health","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/fitness","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","references":[]},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/policy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/policy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/transport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Lance Armstrong's extended appearance on the Oprah Winfrey network, in which the man stripped of seven Tour de France wins finally admitted to doping, has opened him up to several multi-million dollar legal challenges.</p><p>According to reports, the US government may join a \"whistleblower\" lawsuit launched by Armstrong's former colleague, Floyd Landis, on the grounds that Armstrong, while riding for the US Postal Service team, defrauded the American taxpayer. The <em>Sunday Times </em>is set to try to claw back nearly £1m in damages and costs that Armstrong was awarded after he sued it over allegations of doping. A Texas-based sports marketing firm is also suing Armstrong to get back millions of dollars in bonuses it paid out to the cyclist.</p><p>Meanwhile, the International Cycling Union is urging Armstrong to pay back his prize money, and even Australian government officials are reportedly mulling over going to the courts to get back hefty fees paid for appearances in the country from 2009 to 2011. Finally, and perhaps most seriously, Armstrong's confession has opened up the prospect that he might be prosecuted for perjury after previously testifying under oath that he had not taken drugs.</p><p>In seeking public rehabilitation, and a second chance to compete, it is possible that Armstrong has in fact dug himself into a deeper hole than he imagined.</p><p>His emotional mea culpa last week was an audacious move. But the man who beat cancer and regularly – with illegal help – triumphed over any rival on his bike seems to have failed to beat his toughest opponent: public opinion.</p><p>The hours of dialogue with Winfrey, which culminated in a choked-up moment on Friday night as he discussed the impact of his cheating on his family, appear to have failed to give Armstrong the redemption that he craves.</p><p>His confession, which many believe is aimed at reducing his ban from competitive sports and allowing him to take part in triathlons, has been greeted with dismay and criticism. Few critics and fellow athletes who watched his  display have extended the hand of sympathy.</p><p>\"Armstrong said he was sorry for all the years of lying, but he sounded like he was reading a shopping list,\" retorted Howard Kurtz, the media critic for cable news TV station CNN.</p><p>Indeed, part of the problem was that Armstrong was rowing back on so much previous behaviour and years of aggressive lambasting of reporters, officials and team-mates who had claimed he was doping. \"I don't forgive Lance Armstrong, who lied to me in two interviews. And I suspect most of America won't, either,\" Kurtz wrote.</p><p>That was a common sentiment. Many sports stars condemned the former hero, saying his actions – in both taking drugs and then denying it for so many years – had damaged the image of sports far beyond cycling. \"I guess all I needed to see was the first few minutes [of the interview] and then I knew what was the deal, and the rest I don't really care,\" tennis player Roger Federer told reporters at the Australian Open. \"I'm an active athlete right now, and it's not fun times really to be in sports to a degree.\"</p><p>Anti-doping officials were equally unimpressed. If Armstrong's aim was to reduce his ban, then it appears to have failed. \"He spoke to a talk-show host. I don't think any of it amounted to assistance to the anti-doping community, let alone substantial assistance. You bundle it all up and say, 'So what?',\" said David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency, in an interview with the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p>On Friday night, Armstrong appeared more emotional in his talk with Winfrey than in the first interview. Winfrey is renowned for being a virtual therapist to the public ordeals of disgraced celebrities, often bringing them to tears. Armstrong, who throughout last week had appeared unnervingly controlled, did not shed a tear but he did appear to choke up. \"I saw my son defending me and saying, \"That's not true. What you're saying about my dad is not true. That's when I knew I had to tell him,\" Armstrong said. The cyclist paused, lip trembling, and looked away as he composed himself.</p><p>But aside from that moment the rest of the interview went largely as expected, with Armstrong confessing to his sins – though by no means agreeing to all the accusations levelled against him – and showing perhaps unwise flashes of defiance and self-regard.</p><p>He told Winfrey he was desperate to compete again, effectively admitting he was not coming clean out of guilt but because he cannot tolerate life outside of sports. \"If you're asking me, do I want to compete again ... the answer is, hell, yes. I'm a competitor. It's what I've done my whole life. I love to train. I love to race,\" he said. He even said he deserved a second chance, perhaps breaking the cardinal rule of such TV confessions, which is to remain entirely contrite.</p><p>\"Frankly, this may not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it,\" he told Winfrey.</p><p>In choosing Winfrey, Armstrong dodged the news media that had been accusing him for years, trading Winfrey's softball questions and avoiding an interrogator who would have grilled him properly. Yet even in those circumstances Armstrong seemed to fail to come entirely clean. He did not reveal why he chose to take the doping route, how he did it and who helped him do it and cover it up for so long. He denied trying to buy influence with the anti-doping body USADA with an offer of a donation of millions of dollars. He said he had stayed clean of drugs in his 2009 attempted comeback, something that runs counter to a damning USADA report that catalogued all the accusations against him.</p><p>Winfrey asked Armstrong if he might \"rise again\" in public life to reclaim some of his once golden boy reputation as the cancer-beating super athlete. \"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's out there,\" Armstrong replied. Whatever it is, it's almost certainly not good.</p><h2>Armstrong's errors</h2><p><strong>Didn't cry properly</strong></p><p>When high-profile guests appear on Oprah Winfrey's show, they are expected to weep copiously as they reveal all. Someone as competitive as Armstrong knows that second place counts for nothing: his choking up and near-tears just did not cut it. America wanted rivers of tears.</p><p></p><p><strong>Didn't give a full confession</strong></p><p>The only way to do a confession is to go all the way. Armstrong appeared to want to go only so far. He needed to name names and give full and frank details. But Armstrong seemed happy with generalities and still denies key allegations.</p><p><strong>Didn't lose the 'attitude'</strong></p><p>During the hours of interview, many commentators remarked on Armstrong's controlled and emotionless demeanour. Armstrong needed to show he was human and worthy of sympathy and – most importantly of all – genuine. His performance came across as just that: something fake for the camera.</p><p></p><p><strong>Played the victim</strong></p><p>Armstrong seemed to break another cardinal rule of such confessions in having too much self-pity. At one point, he felt that he \"deserved\" a chance of a comeback. He had failed to understand that in the world of TV confessions that is not up to you any more.</p>","headline":"Lance Armstrong faces multi-million dollar legal challenges after confession","trailText":"Disgraced cyclist's Oprah interview fails to impress public and anti-doping officials – and court cases are mounting","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2013/1/19/1358613352439/Lance-Armstrong-003.jpg","wordcount":"1192","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-26T23:55:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-legal-challenges-confession","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-legal-challenges-confession","tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/lance-armstrong","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","webTitle":"Oprah Winfrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","references":[]},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/uknews","webTitle":"News","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paulharris","webTitle":"Paul Harris","rcsId":"GNL004733","r2ContributorId":"16239","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/24/1359029262500/Paul-web.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Harris is a US correspondent for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a> and Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulharris","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/paulharris","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-402688597","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2013/1/19/1358613349833/Lance-Armstrong-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Mandel Ngan","altText":"Lance Armstrong","height":"54","credit":"Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"A man watches Lance Armstrong being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.

But questions remained over allegations of bribery and cover-up, and whether he doped in his 2009-10 comeback.</p><p>The second, hour-long interview, which aired on Friday night on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) completed a dramatic confession whose first segment aired a night earlier, delivering a huge scoop to the struggling network.</p><p>Armstrong, 41, repeated his contrition, addressing the millions of supporters who had believed his years of denials about using performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids and EPO. \"I'd say I understand your anger, your sense of betrayal. You supported me forever through all of this ... and I lied to you. And I'm sorry. I will spend – and I'm committed to spending – as long as I have to to make amends.\"</p><p>Asked if he owed an apology to David Walsh, the Sunday Times journalist who doggedly pursued the story despite intimidation and threats from Armstrong, he briefly hesitated, before saying: \"I'd apologise to David.\"</p><p>The Texan said his remorse was genuine, not an attempt to deflect damage. \"Everybody who gets caught is bummed out that they got caught. Do I have remorse? Absolutely. Will it grow? Absolutely. For me these are the first steps. These are my actions. I'm paying the price but I deserve it.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/18/lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey\">In the first interview on Thursda</a>y, Winfrey extracted a frank confession from Amstrong, who admitted  to having doped before his 1995 battle with cancer  and during his sevens straight Tour de France wins between 1999 and 2005. Critics said she failed to demand sufficient detail and expressed scepticism over Armstrong's continued denials about allegedly paying the International Cycling Union (UCI) and a Swiss laboratory to bury positive dope tests. Many also doubted his claim to have competed cleanly during a 2009-10 comeback.</p><p>Winfrey did not press those issues in the second interview segment and instead focused on Armstrong's relationship with his family, his sponsors and his inner turmoil.</p><p>He described his decision to sever ties with his cancer foundation Livestrong last November, after a Usada report exposed his cheating and made his position untenable, as humbling. \"The story was getting out of control, it was my worst nightmare ... the foundation is like my sixth child.. and to make that decision, and to step aside, that was big. It was the best thing for the organisation but it hurt like hell.\"</p><p>Showed a clip of a defiant Armstrong denying doping during a 2005 deposition, he winced. \"It's sick. I don't like that guy. That is a guy who felt invincible ... that guy is still there, I'm not going to lie to you and the public and say oh I'm in therapy, he's gone.\"</p><p>He admitted to being narcissistic and said if one of his children behaved like he did in the tape he would be \"apoplectic\".</p><p>Armstrong said he wished to compete again, if not in cycling then running, such as the Chicago marathon or Austin 10K. Winfrey appeared incredulous he wished to be allowed to compete again. He said: \"This may not be the most popular answer right now ... but I think I deserve it.\"</p><p>Asked if he had got what he deserved, in terms of comeuppance, he replied: \"I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure I deserve the death penalty,\" referring to his complete ban from sporting events.</p><p>Armstrong said an infamous tweet, showing him lying at home amid his framed Tour de France yellow jerseys just after being banned, was an act of defiance. \"And you know what's scary I actually thought it was a good idea at the time.\"</p><p>He said the destruction of his legend had changed how he viewed himself. \"This is heavy, this is messy.\" He said he was undergoing therapy. \"I've had a messy life, this is going to be a long process ... There is not going to be one tectonic shift here.\"</p><p>Armstrong said he made a comeback in 2009 after promising his then-wife, Kristin, to compete cleanly. \"I gave her my word and I stuck to it.\" He said he expected to win the Tour de France that year because improved drug testing had cleaned up the sport and levelled the playing field. He came third.</p><p>Armstrong's flinty demeanour cracked when he recounted how his 13-year-old son Luke had defended him against the taunts of other children. Groping for words, he said: \"It almost goes ... he can't. That's when I knew I had to tell him. And he'd never asked me. He'd never said, Dad is this true. He'd trusted me.\"</p><p>He confessed to his son and twin daughters, aged 11. \"I said, 'listen there's been a lot of questions about your Dad's career ... I want you to know that it's true'. They didn't say much. Didn't say, but wait, Dad. They just accepted it.\"</p><p>The face raw, the voice quavering, he told Winfrey: \"I said, Luke, don't defend me anymore.\" His son, he said, responded well. \"He just said, I love you, you're my Dad, this won't change that. Thank god he's more like Kris than he is like me.\" His downfall had made his mother a \"wreck\".</p><p>Armstrong said he \"selfishly\" hoped the TV confessional would prompt the anti-doping agency Usada to lift its ban but his main motive was his children, including the two youngest, toddlers. \"They have no idea [about the scandal] but they will learn it. This conversation will live forever. That dumb tweet with the yellow jerseys will live forever.\"</p><p>In a rare investigative foray, Winfrey asked about a claim that Armstrong tried to pay off Usada with a donation. \"No. That's not true.\"</p><p>Losing sponsors was financially devastating, he said. \"I've lost all future income. You could look at that day and a half when people (sponsors) left. That was a $75m day. Gone. Gone. And probably never coming back.\"</p><p>Asked was he a better human being because of his ruin, he said: \"Without a doubt.. the biggest challenge of the rest of my life is not slip up again.\" Winfrey ended the interview by saying the truth \"sets you free\". Armstrong paused. \"Yep.\"</p>","headline":"Lance Armstrong 'sick' and tearful in second Oprah Winfrey interview","trailText":"<p>Second Oprah Winfrey interview focuses on personal turmoil as disgraced cyclist discusses family impact</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/19/1358562363177/91f502b7-ee4f-49a8-8b01-dc62fc747396-140.jpeg","wordcount":"1060","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-22T04:56:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey-second-interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey-second-interview","tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/lance-armstrong","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","webTitle":"Oprah Winfrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rorycarroll","webTitle":"Rory Carroll","rcsId":"GNL002301","r2ContributorId":"16369","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/rory_carroll_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rory Carroll is a US west coast correspondent based in Los Angeles</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rorycarroll","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/rorycarroll","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-402685630","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/19/1358562363177/91f502b7-ee4f-49a8-8b01-dc62fc747396-140.jpeg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"LM Otero","altText":"A video screen at a hotel restaurant in Grapevine, Texas, Friday, shows Lance Armstrong being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.","height":"84","credit":"LM Otero/AP","caption":"A video screen at a hotel restaurant in Grapevine, Texas, Friday, shows Lance Armstrong being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.
