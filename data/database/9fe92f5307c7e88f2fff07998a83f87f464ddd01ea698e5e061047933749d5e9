Mind you, his cinemagoing life took a nasty turn from the start…<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/20/threads-the-film-that-frightened-me-most-halloween\" title=\"\">• Threads: the film that frightened Peter Bradshaw the most</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>My Uncle Vince will tell you that the scariest film I’ve ever seen is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipivUGVydMY\">Return to Oz</a>. This is purely because, when he took me to see it in 1985, I immediately embarked upon such a sustained series of full-volume terror-fits that we were forced to leave halfway though. I was four years old. Who takes a four-year-old to see a film with decapitated heads in it, though? An idiot, that’s who.</p> <p>I can’t tell you the name of the film that caused me the most psychological distress, either, because I don’t actually know it. I know it was broadcast on TV in the late 1980s. I know that I only saw the ending, in which a woman has a breakdown, chops off all her hair, smears her face with lipstick, goes to a theatre and murders a man onstage with a machine-gun while screaming and cackling. I know it singlehandedly prevented me from getting a proper amount of sleep for about six months. But I have no idea what it was called. If you know, please tell me. It’s been 25 years, and I’m desperate for closure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-baad76b5-7b53-420a-b23c-e512c38e5901\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413887463195/1d5ccc8a-5cc6-421d-a685-f5f53656a2f2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"sadako ringu ring japanese horror\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baddie hair day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Omega</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which leaves Hideo Nakata’s Ring (Ringu). Again, I first saw this on television a couple of years after its theatrical release, with my university housemates. It was heavily trailed, both by Channel 4 and everyone who’d seen it, as one of the scariest films ever made. But we were obnoxious, ironic students, and the main reason we watched it was to prove the consensus wrong. This, in retrospect, was stupid.<br /></p> <p>The film’s first couple of scares were unsettling, but schlocky enough for us to laugh off. Then, as the plot became more unsettlingly obtuse, the laughter began to die down. And then the phone rang. And then Sadako crawled out of the well. And then she didn’t stop crawling, and we all found ourselves involuntarily pushing against the back of the sofa in a doomed bid to somehow get to the other side where everything was safe. Then came the close-up. We all yelped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Z-MOqAvtY\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9Z-MOqAvtY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>As the film ended, we all just sat there, numb. We turned the television off. Thankfully, it stayed off. Nobody spoke for ages. Eventually, someone – I forget who – quietly piped up and said that they wanted to go to bed, but they didn’t want to go upstairs alone. So we all traipsed upstairs together like bloody <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo#mediaviewer/File:Scooby-gang-1969.jpg\">Mystery Incorporated</a>, all just because we’d just seen a film about a spooky VHS.</p> <p>Enough time has passed now for me to realise that Ring is less a film and more packaging for a single scene. And that scene is just a slightly updated version of the old unstoppable baddie trope. Really, there’s nothing really to separate Sadako from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF2OcMjMnR4#t=2m10s\">Count Orlok</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/the-shining-heres-johnny-scariest-movie-scene-jack-nicholson\">Jack Torrance</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/02/freddy-krueger-nightmare-elm-street\">Freddy Krueger</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/feb/22/killer-robots-in-film-in-pictures-alien-blade-runner-terminator?index=9\">The Terminator</a>.</p> <p>But in the moment, watching it for the very first time, it was like living through a nightmare. The only way I could console myself after watching Ring was to remember that the television in my bedroom was on top of a wardrobe, and that Sadako would topple out and break her neck if she ever tried any of that crap with me. Genuinely, that was a comfort.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/ring-nakata-ringu-horror\">Ring: 12th best horror of all time</a></li> </ul>","headline":"Ring: the film that frightened me most","trailText":"Japanese cult horror Ringu scared <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong> (and a whole houseful of his friends) rigid.

published this week, Jennifer Lawrence has attacked celebrity blogger Perez Hilton for posting hacked nude photos on his website.</p> <p>After hackers accessed the iCloud accounts of Lawrence and tens of other celebrities, and posted private and often explicit images of them on the website 4chan, Hilton reposted the images. He later took them down and apologised, saying on Twitter: “At work we often have to make quick decisions. I made a really bad one today and then made it worse. I feel awful and am truly sorry.” He also posted a video apology, saying: “A lot of you let me know that my actions were wrong. I didn’t even stop to think about my actions.”</p> <p>Lawrence told Vanity Fair: “He took it down because people got pissed, and that’s the only reason why. And then I had to watch his apology. And what he basically said was, ‘I just didn’t think about it.’ ‘I just didn’t think about it’ is not an excuse. That is the exact issue itself.”</p> <p>She also made an overture to the more salacious and gossipy corners of the internet, where Hilton resides: “You have a choice. You don’t have to be a person who spreads negativity and lies for a living. You can do something good.”</p> <p>In other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/07/jennifer-lawrence-nude-photo-hack-sex-crime\">previously published statements</a>, Lawrence was strident in her denunciation of the hackers and viewers of the images. She referred to the hack as a “sex crime”, and that “anybody who looked at those pictures, you’re perpetuating a sexual offence. You should cower with shame.”</p> <p>Elsewhere in the candid interview, she discusses wanting “peaceful” rather than “passionate” romantic relationships, and following a question about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman\">the death of her Hunger Games co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, she replies: “Death is a terrible thing that should be respected … for somebody to say that they’re not afraid of death makes me want to punch them in the fucking face. Because when you’re touched by death, you realise how powerful it is.”</p>","headline":"Jennifer Lawrence criticises Perez Hilton over nude photo hack","trailText":"The actor rejected the apology from the celebrity blogger, after he published nude photos of her that were hacked online","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413880625921/731aaba7-008d-450d-bd68-d0c5e7b41ce3-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"337","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-24T11:15:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/21/jennifer-lawrence-criticises-perez-hilton-nude-photo-hack-vanity-fair","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/oct/21/jennifer-lawrence-criticises-perez-hilton-nude-photo-hack-vanity-fair","tags":[{"id":"film/jennifer-lawrence","webTitle":"Jennifer Lawrence","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/jennifer-lawrence","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"media/perez-hilton","webTitle":"Perez Hilton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/perez-hilton","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/perez-hilton","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity","references":[]},{"id":"media/magazines","webTitle":"Magazines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/magazines","references":[]},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/pressandpublishing","references":[]},{"id":"media/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy & the media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/privacy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/privacy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","firstName":"ben","lastName":"beaumont-thomas","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.

When Tarek is arrested and threatened with deportation, he mounts a one-man campaign in an effort to help his new friend secure his freedom. <br /></p> <p>At first glance, The Visitor appears to be an unlikely inspiration for a Broadway musical.

research suggests that viewers may be partly responsible for ‘ratings creep’ which has seen younger children exposed to increasing levels of big screen sex and violence</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Parents become desensitised over time when viewing movies featuring adult content such as sex and violence, <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/10/film-sex-violence-moviegoers-parents-study-mpaa-853893/\">according to a new US study</a>.<br /><br />Researchers for the Annenberg Public Policy Centre found that viewers watching a series of bloodthirsty or erotic scenes from films such as Casino Royale, Collateral, 8 Mile and Die Hard were less able to gauge their suitability for children as time went by. <br /><br />“The rise of violence and gun violence in PG-13 movies means that lots of kids are able to go into movie theatres and see explicit violence,” said Dan Romer, the policy centre’s associate director and lead author of the study lead. “We wanted to find out why parents didn’t show more concern. Why was this happening without pushback?”<br /><br />Research, conducted online in January, showed scenes from six movies with similar levels of sex and violence to parents of children aged six to 18. The study found that viewers of the first scene felt an appropriate age would be, on average, 16.9 for violent content and 17.2 for sexualised content. But by the time they had watched the sixth scene, respondents’ perception of the appropriate age had dropped to 13.9 for violent content and 14 for sexualised content. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b526021706ffcc663cbc828b0b426d9c2331e932\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413879260485/325b6b1d-9d4d-4abf-87eb-d085eaad46f9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedtime stories … Eva Green and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bedtime stories … Eva Green and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Study authors suggested the desensitisation phenomenon could also affect other frequent film viewers, such as those who decide the age appropriate level of movies. This would help explain the longterm “ratings creep” phenomenon which has seen censors on both sides of the Atlantic relax ratings over the past 40 years so that movies handed an R or 15 in the 1970s might now be seen as tame PG-13 or 12A affairs. In a study last year, the policy centre found that films rated PG-13 now contain more gun violence than those rated R in the US and that gun violence in PG-13 films has tripled since 1985.</p> <p>“We were most surprised by how clear and dramatic the decline was to showing that kind of content to young people and the willingness to let their own children to see it,” said Romer. “Our entire culture may be undergoing desensitisation to violent movies with consequences that remain unknown.”</p> <p><br />The findings, which follow research conducted with 1,000 respondents, will be published in the new November issue of Pediatrics magazine and were first reported by Deadline.</p>","headline":"Parents 'too desensitised to judge appropriate films for children'","trailText":"New research suggests that viewers may be partly responsible for ‘ratings creep’ which has seen younger children exposed to increasing levels of big screen sex and violence","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413879169127/96906ab7-ad2f-49c5-8f92-fcdb5ea08ef4-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"396","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-24T09:15:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/21/parents-too-desentisitised-to-judge-appropriate-films-for-children","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/oct/21/parents-too-desentisitised-to-judge-appropriate-films-for-children","tags":[{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"world/censorship","webTitle":"Censorship","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/censorship","references":[]},{"id":"film/family","webTitle":"Family","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/family","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/family","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex","description":"Sex and relationship advice from the Guardian.

Calendar Girls","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-21T06:00:04Z","sectionName":"Film","sectionId":"film","id":"culture/2014/oct/21/how-we-made-calendar-girls","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42tjj","standfirst":"<p>Celia Imrie: ‘I’m used to being called Biggers Buns’</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2><strong>Nigel Cole, director</strong></h2> <p>When the actors we’d cast met their real-life counterparts from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/17/womens-institute-uk-city-london\">Women’s Institute</a>, they were struck by their group spirit, the supportive atmosphere that had got them all through the embarrassment of taking their clothes off to make a calendar. That same spirit started to show on set, with the cast deciding they wanted to experience the venture in the same way as the WI women. They were determined to be nude, even when it wasn’t needed for the camera, for face shots and that kind of thing.</p> <p>This made it harder for me: however strategically we placed vegetables, bits kept showing through and we’d have to reshoot. Even after we’d finished and cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/features.review\">the film</a>, there were things popping out that shouldn’t have been – and a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing all the private parts.</p> <p>Although the nude scenes only took a week, it felt like a year. The more you know you shouldn’t look, the more you want to, and I noticed the film crew keeping very busy, working far harder than they normally do because they didn’t want to be caught gazing. It was a challenge as a director having to confront veteran actors who were completely naked. I’ve never made so much eye contact in my life. I’d offered to strip myself, so we were all in it together. That might have made it easier for me, but the offer was declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1_QH57InDo\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_QH57InDo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The actors were very supportive of each other: a bottle of champagne would be waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene. They were all women in their 50s and 60s and were thrilled by roles that recognised their sensuality. After one nude shoot, I recall having to tell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> to put her robe back on three or four times.</p> <p>It was rare for a film to focus on middle-aged women and not just show them as mothers or aunties. But this made it harder to cast the male parts: several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women. Also, it was the era of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84830/billy.elliot\">Billy Elliot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/69487/full.monty\">The Full Monty</a>, and I was keen to make a film about northern England that was not about poverty and deprivation. These were middle-aged, middle-class women who wanted to break out of the mould. I remember waiting at Skipton station to be collected by Helen Mirren’s real-life counterpart. Every time a battered old Ford came along, I thought that must be her. Then a black BMW roared up blaring rock music and there she was at the wheel. It brought home to me how guilty we all are of stereotyping.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/12/celia-imrie-this-much-know\"><strong>Celia Imrie</strong></a><strong>, actor</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab453c13920ddce40e84fb09551e7330818c34a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413825568781/6cfd0a8b-e0e0-4e71-b234-be65de0476ae-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Celia Imrie in Calendar Girls\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celia Imrie: ‘Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Touchstone/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can’t bear taking my clothes off. I have never been a pretty young thing and stripping off is far more daring when you don’t have a figure to die for. But I love a challenge and there was never any question of us wearing flesh-coloured coverings. That would have been a cheat. The real-life calendar girls taught all of us in the cast not to take ourselves too seriously – and Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on.</p> <p>I was the first. I had first-night-style nerves beforehand but, given that my character was supposed to be nervous, the anxiety actually helped. And the rest of the cast made a big fuss of me afterwards in my dressing room, where they’d set out champagne and Twiglets.</p> <p>We shot some scenes in the village where the original calendar girls lived. It made us realise how daring they’d been: it’s a very small community and there were a lot of objectors. We were staying in a hotel with a gym and, although I loathe them, I thought I’d better use it, given what I was facing. I crept down at 6am when I thought it would be empty. But when I opened the door, the rest of the cast were already in there working out.</p> <p>Since the film came out, I’m used to being called Bigger Buns now. A girl shouted it when she saw me out walking once, which was embarrassing. I prefer to remember the rather handsome young man in Paris who caught my eye in the street, looked down at my chest and declared: “Les grands gâteaux!”</p> <h2>More on Calendar Girls</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/29/calendar-girls\">Peter Bradshaw’s original review</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/features.review\">Mark Kermode’s original review</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/30/features.johnpatterson\">John Patterson meets Helen Mirren</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/01/1\">Simon Hattenstone meets Julie Walters</a></p>","headline":"How we made ...

The rivers are withering, the landscape a scratchy brown, and woe betide those who break the hosepipe ban.<br /><br />Perfect weather, then, for a gravelly performance from Harry Dean Stanton: a man with a face like dust bowl, dessicated further by 70 odd years of cigarettes.<br /><br />Stanton has appeared in more than 200 movies including Paris, Texas, Wild At Heart and as cat loving Brett in Alien. I first saw him as the dad in Pretty in Pink. Laconic, beaten-down, accepting, I thought he was the coolest thing since Molly Ringwald’s prom frock.<br /><br />His backstory was explored Sophie Huber’s brilliant documentary, Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction (released in 2012, now available on Netflix).</p> <p>This Swiss-born film-maker first meets her subject in his regular drinking haunt, Dan Tanas in Santa Monica, and uses music as her route in to this intensely private man. She follows him as he potters about his day-to-day routine, splicing the footage with pared down renditions of his favourite songs, such as Danny Boy and Blue Bayou, which are performed from the safety of his living room. </p> <p>Late last month, the film was screened at the Grammy Museum in downtown LA, and both Stanton and Huber took part in a charming Q&amp;A afterwards. Followed by some tunes: Stanton singing and on harmonica, accompanied by guitar and bass. </p> <p>As he took to the stage, fragile as a larch, the audience moved to the edge of their seats. Stanton fumbled first for his reading glasses, then for one of his many harmonicas, all tuned to different keys. Would he make it through the first bar? He would; albeit from the comfort of an overstuffed armchair (as he said - he is 12 years off 100).</p> <p>His exit was quicker: Stanton scarpered immediately after the three tracks were over; his guitarist, Jamie, revealed to the crowd that he’d called the night before to try and wriggle out of the performance. </p> <p>Stanton was one of those rare beasts: exactly in the flesh as you’d suspect from the screen. Introspective, and mischievous; a loner, and old-fashioned with it. In an age of white noise and celebrity hysteria, this was a reminder of a previous time; refreshing courtesy in the drought. He’d never married, he said in the film - and only once proposed because it seemed the civil thing to do. He’s wiser now he’s older, he said. After all, “what’s wrong with silence?”</p>","headline":"Harry Dean Stanton: at 88, still going strong down Route 66","trailText":"A screening of an acclaimed documentary about the actor offered a rare chance to see him in concert","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413823204655/38313b82-3845-474e-a4c4-57dbd33aee0b-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"405","commentable":"false","byline":"Lisa Marks","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-27T18:10:25Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/20/harry-dean-stanton-at-88-still-going-strong-down-route-66","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/20/harry-dean-stanton-at-88-still-going-strong-down-route-66","tags":[{"id":"film/series/ladiary","webTitle":"LA diary","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/ladiary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/ladiary","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lisamarks","webTitle":"Lisa Marks","r2ContributorId":"25517","firstName":"lisa","lastName":"marks","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Lisa Marks is a screen-writer/director and journalist.

The humble staircase provides the perfect opportunity for dramatic entrances, exits and chases in some of film’s most iconic and infamous scenes. <br /></p> <p><strong>If you’ve got an idea for a Clip joint that you’d like to write, email <a href=\"mailto:tshepo.mokoena@theguardian.com\">tshepo.mokoena@theguardian.com</a>.</strong></p> <h2>The Exorcist</h2> <p>Director William Friedkin omitted Regan’s “spider walk” scene from his original theatrical cut after deciding the presence of wires, which suspended contortionist Linda R. Hager in her arched position, rendered the scene technically ineffective. Years later, when a director’s cut was released and CGI technology was readily available, this disturbing scene was included.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebi5zuL03Wc\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ebi5zuL03Wc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Rocky</h2> <p>Would any discussion of scenes involving stairs be complete without including the Italian Stallion himself hammering his way up the 72 stone steps outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art? The scene has become something of a cultural icon with tourists re-enacting the walk daily while bored Philadelphians roll their eyes and go about their business. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NubH5BDOaD8\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NubH5BDOaD8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Psycho</h2> <p>In what may be considered the most frightening scene in Hitchcock’s classic, private detective Arbogast slowly ascends the staircase within the Bates’ residence. Norman, dressed as mother, emerges from the bedroom in a chilling ceiling shot and butchers the unfortunate private eye. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bieIiX5KLQ\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bieIiX5KLQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The Shining</h2> <p>Jack isn’t happy that his meddling wife has decided to take a peek at his wonderfully varied and rich manuscript (all work and no play anyone?) so he decides to stalk the terrified woman, baseball bat in hand, through the Colorado Lounge and up the rear staircase.</p> <p>Shelley Duvall’s terror may look and seem real because it kind of was. In trying to draw the performance he wanted from the actress, Stanley Kubrick drove Duvall into a state of near frenzy throughout the 1 year shoot. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sMmgIVJFms\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sMmgIVJFms?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Battleship Potemkin</h2> <p>The fact that directors from De Palma to Coppola have paid homage to the Odessa Steps sequence is testament to the enduring power of the scene and also the influence Sergei Eisentein had on the language of cinema. The sequence pioneered the now common cinematic practice of montage and its innovative editing techniques manipulated audience’s perceptions of time over the near 8 minute sequence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-v-kZzfec\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ps-v-kZzfec?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <ul> <li>Follow writer Charles Graham-Dixon on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlesGD\">@CharlesGD</a>.<br /></li> </ul>","headline":"Clip joint: steps - five of the most heavenly stairways in cinema","trailText":"A selection of five of the most memorable cinematic scenes where staircases and steps played a key dramatic role.

performances from a trio of young Brazilian actors save Daldry’s compelling tale of corruption from a rubbish ending</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Last summer the world gathered in Rio for the World Cup in which the home team suffered a loss of historic proportions. In the lead-up to the games, demonstrators took to the streets to protest against misspent public funds allocated to the sporting event while 20% of Brazilians live in poverty. Numerous homegrown movies and documentaries have shed a spotlight on rampant corruption, injustice and police brutality, but Brazil is still a place of sunshine and carnival for many Europeans, though not Stephen Daldry, whose new film Trash, screening at the 2014 Rome international film festival and opening in the UK in January, is set in seedy favelas and landfills where pickers forage for a living.</p> <p>One such forager is 14-year-old Raphael Fernandez (Rickson Tevez, in a stunning debut), who finds a wallet containing a wad of cash, a flip-book photo of a little girl and the key to a train-station locker. Along with his best friend Gardo and a pariah called Rato, who lives in a sewer, they hide their find from a corrupt police inspector who appears ready to move heaven and Earth to recover it. Key to solving the mystery is a list of numbers scrawled on the back of a photograph and a Bible in the hands of a prison inmate whose murdered son was an adviser to a corrupt mayoral candidate. The race is on between the boys and the police to solve the riddle and recover a missing fortune along with a ledger containing a litany of corrupt officials. Assisting the boys are Martin Sheen as an American priest, and Rooney Mara as an aide worker, though both have limited purpose in the movie beyond making Trash a safer bet for investors and boosting market potential.</p> <p>With Trash, Daldry does what he’s been doing since his breakthrough, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84830/billy.elliot\">Billy Elliot</a>; he delivers a well-crafted, above-average film that aims high but invariably falls short. That movie’s greatest strength is Jamie Bell’s performance. He was just 14 at the time, as was Thomas Horn, who made his debut in Daldry’s 2011 movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142797/extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close\">Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close</a>. Each features outstanding debuts by youngsters, demonstrating the one thing Daldry does better than any of his peers.</p> <p>His new movie goes one step further in that his trio of young actors speak no English, nor had they training or acting aspirations when they signed on. With its heavy plotting, Trash hardly aspires to docudrama, yet the trio paint an indelible portrait of youth in crisis that is essential to the movie’s success.</p> <p>Richard Curtis’s well-paced script based on Andy Mulligan’s novel is short on exposition at the onset, which keeps the audience guessing, but offers an unwieldy knot of information halfway through. As a mystery, Trash is compelling enough though its milieu and the outstanding performances at the centre of the movie are what set it apart, along with Elliot Graham’s kinetically edited chase sequences through a train station and later a favela.</p> <p>The trash heap Raphael and his friends dig through was created by the production because real landfills contain a high level of toxic waste. Daldry has talked about how social-justice movies are often downers, which is why he ended Trash on an optimistic note that undermines otherwise strong thematic elements. It is at odds with the performances and feels as inorganic as Daldry’s ready-made trash heap, though not enough to sabotage an otherwise enjoyable effort.</p>","headline":"Trash first look review –

I don’t have faith in my abilities,” the one-time Transformers star said. “It’s like if I told you to react to a gunshot right now. It would be much easier if I just got a gun out and pulled the trigger, because you wouldn’t have to conjure anything. You would just react to it. I try to alter my life so that I don’t have to conjure anything or to make believe.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/25/fury-brad-pitt-world-war-ii-tank-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2116278\"                data-video-name=\"Fury: watch Brad Pitt in the trailer for the World War II tank thriller - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Sony\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/25/1403709964857/Brad-Pitt-in-Fury-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-440452008\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/25/1403709963456/Brad-Pitt-in-Fury-009.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/25/140625Fury1-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/25/140625Fury1_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/25/140625Fury1.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/25/140625Fury1_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/25/140625Fury1/140625Fury1.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Fury</figcaption> </figure>  <p>LaBeouf also revealed that producers instituted <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201411/logan-lerman-fury\">a gruelling boot camp</a> for cast members Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, Jon Bernthal and Scott Eastwood. “It was more than a physical thing – it was psychological,” he said. “They built situations that were doomed to fail so you couldn’t win. You get to 100 push-ups and they’d say 100 more, then when you do that it would be 100 more.</p> <p>“You have to rely on each other because if I can’t do it, Jon’s got to do them. And if he can’t, Mike’s got to do them, and so forth. You learn to relinquish yourself as the ‘we’ of it rather than the ‘I’. It takes the selfishness away.”</p> <p>The actor’s extreme method-acting tactics were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/07/shia-labeouf-slashed-face-for-second-world-war-drama-fury\">revealed by co-star Lerman</a> in an interview with GQ.

Just don’t call him a baby … <br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>I have never regarded myself as a hardcore horror fan, although no cinephile can possibly deny the genre’s habitual brilliance and flair. Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby and Friedkin’s The Exorcist are masterpieces – and there is a real case to be made, incidentally, for the first Saw, by James Wan, now enjoying its 10th anniversary. I have been unnerved, thrilled, sometimes shocked and often thoroughly creeped out, by horror films. But hand on heart I don’t think I have ever been scared, really properly scared by horror: and this is despite being a fantastic scaredy-cat in real life. I often describe myself as a lover (of my own safety), not a fighter. <br /></p> <p>What disconcerts me sometimes is what’s expected of the genre. People coming out of a great comedy will be laughing. People coming out of a great action movie will be whooping and fist-pumping. But people coming out of a great horror movie don’t look horrified – they’re laughing and whooping and fist-pumping. Which of course is fine.</p> <p>The only film I have been really and truly scared and indeed horrified by – in an intense and sustained way – is Mick Jackson’s post-nuclear apocalypse movie Threads, scripted by Barry Hines and originally made for BBC television. It was made and broadcast in 1984, although the film’s realistic content easily trumped whatever speculative Orwellian resonance was there to be noticed that year. That period was not as tense as the missile crisis of 1962, but after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the diplomatic tensions between the great superpowers could hardly be worse and the ability of artists and film-makers to think the unthinkable had evolved. The government’s Protect and Survive leaflets – themselves a blood-chilling promise of armageddon – had entered the general consciousness: the phrase was satirically transformed by CND into Protest and Survive. I attended a CND-sponsored screening of Peter Watkins’s The War Game in 1981, when it was still banned from the airwaves, and that magnificent film was upsetting enough, particularly its voiceover from nice, friendly, familiar Michael Aspel. But the intense discussion afterwards calmed us all – allowed us to channel and manage our fear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"383c3330018a62530f6a8c8badae5f70c07d82eb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413802871318/b0b2a8db-a2ed-4943-ba99-401587d32218-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Threads\" width=\"450\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Threads: letting us channel our fear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn’t until I saw Threads that I found that something on screen could make me break out in a cold, shivering sweat and keep me in that condition for 20 minutes, followed by weeks of depression and anxiety.</p> <p>It’s about a couple in Sheffield living their normal lives, looking forward to being parents. They try to ignore the preamble to nuclear war by concentrating on decorating their flat. There’s a nuclear strike in the north of England and over weeks, months and years the focus is opened up with a kind of satanic grandeur into the general catastrophe: we see how society degenerates into violent nothingness.</p> <p>Everyone who has seen Threads knows where the real payload of horror comes, and those squeamish about spoilers or thermonuclear birth defects can look away now. The baby is born in the post-nuclear hell. Beyond pain, beyond love, the mother looks into the dirty bundle and she sees ...</p> <p>She sees ...</p> <p>Well, I still don’t know exactly what. I was watching the film with my girlfriend and her sister in the manky basement of a pretty unsafe house off the Cowley Road in Oxford – a setting which seemed worryingly close to the film. At this moment, my girlfriend’s sister gave a cry or a gasp which I will never forget, and walked out of the room. I looked at her, as a way of not looking at the screen, and then I looked down at the carpet. I was genuinely scared to look up. Threads had flooded my body with the diabolic opposite of adrenaline. We all went to bed in utter silence. I have still never experienced anything like it in years of film-going, telly-watching, book-munching, culture-consuming activity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_s8CrRN76M\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_s8CrRN76M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>I was really, really scared. Much later, I remember watching Lucy Walker’s admirable anti-nuclear documentary Countdown to Zero and almost trying to suppress the memory of Threads, to suppress the horror and despair so that I could concentrate.</p> <p>It is a remarkable film, occasionally revived in film festivals. Jackson went on to direct the comparable A Very British Coup on television, and then more mainstream fare like The Bodyguard. Barry Hines had of course famously adapted his own novels A Kestrel for a Knave and Looks and Smiles for Ken Loach – mighty achievements. But I think Threads is the dark masterpiece for both. <br /></p>","headline":"Threads: the film that frightened me most","trailText":"In the first of a new Halloween series, <strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong> reveals he was a shivering wreck for weeks after watching Mick Jackson’s post-nuclear masterpiece.

At last, they cry, a brand that makes spreadsheets sexy, makes panhandling productive. As anyone who’s ever thrown in a fiver for a pal’s ill-fated Bobby Davro biopic knows, the company’s model has been shrewdly formulated. Cash-strapped creatives pitch projects with an eye to raising public backing; we chip in and get the feature, short or video game anticipated, or – if the minimum target isn’t raised – our money back. It’s a no-win/no-fee way to crowdfund, hive-mind and exit-poll all at once.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/events/filmfest2014\">Kickstarter film fest</a>, which concluded its first UK run this past weekend in London, fell at the end of a tricky year for the company. Blogger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/21/kickstarter-above-the-game-ban\">Ken Hoinsky</a>’s hands-on seduction treatise, <a href=\"https://www.dosomething.org/petition/kickstarter\">Above the Game: A Guide to Getting Awesome With Women</a>, and multimillionaire Zach Braff’s autobiographical drama, Wish I Was Here (general response: I wish I weren’t) hinted that the company’s anything-goes model had become open to exploitation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0445db0aa70c7e22785e6ef61c8a0befad8321c3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413803362999/8330196c-6d4d-4a41-8a75-e849e5e1eb19-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Zach Braff's autobiographical Wish I Was Here.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zach Braff’s autobiographical Wish I Was Here.

Shouldn’t art be about more than mere book-balancing? Aren’t Kickstarter’s greenlighted projects, by definition, safe bets?</p> <p>The Saturday night showcase event at Prince Charles Cinema suggested possibly not, and that the company still has plenty to be proud about. Take the support it generated for Gillian Robespierre’s quietly radical comedy Obvious Child, whose <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910274/keywords\">IMDb keywords</a> (“abortion”, “reproductive rights”, “peeing in street”) presumably precluded even the modest studio backing afforded to the comparatively timid Juno.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/aug/29/obvious-child-jenny-slate-romantic-comedy-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2149461\"                data-video-name=\"Obvious Child star Jenny Slate: 'I miss romantic comedies where women are complex' – video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/29/1409302788847/Jenny-Slate-and-Gillian-R-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-445772749\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/29/1409302785970/Jenny-Slate-and-Gillian-R-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild/140827ObviousChild.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>The company’s logo similarly adorns this year’s Sundance documentary prize-winner, the sincere poverty study <a href=\"http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13938/rich_hill\">Rich Hill</a>, and the short films of Planet Money, an NPR offshoot that rigorously and ingeniously illustrates how the world works.</p> <p>In such cases, Kickstarter functions as a virtual sibling to such progressively minded mini-studios as Jeff Skoll’s Participant Media or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/feb/18/megan-ellison-producer-the-master\">Megan Ellison</a>’s Annapurna Pictures. It’s enabled both neophytes such as Mike Flanagan, whose unsettling Kickstarted debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa1UJLqYeBU\">Absentia</a>, prefigured this year’s effective multiplex horror <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oculus\">Oculus</a>, and indie veteran Alexandre Rockwell of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkE5jfZg_k0\">In the Soup</a>, whose crowdsourced comeback Little Feet suggests what a Jim Jarmusch kid’s film might be like.

Shown back to back, the trailer for David Sandberg’s VHS-influenced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RqpItxd8M\">Kung Fury</a>, about an 80s cop sent back in time to defeat Hitler (AKA the Kung Führer), and the project video for Kyle Rankin’s <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1364524925/night-of-the-living-deb-a-feature-film\">Night of the Living Deb</a> demonstrated how even sales pitches have become more inventive under the company’s aegis: the former offers far richer visual and comedic pickings than 2012’s crowdfunded Nazis-on-the-moon saga<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146523/iron-sky\"> Iron Sky</a>, while the latter sees Rankin’s read-through with star Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) interrupted by a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Doubtless hundreds more splatterfests await a greenlight. Relatively few organisations, however, can claim to have also facilitated documentaries on Indian puppeteers (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1567618329/tomorrow-we-disappear\">Tomorrow We Disappear</a>) and Finnish cowboys (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1087720796/aatsinki-the-story-of-arctic-cowboys\">Aatsinki</a>), Michael Snow-like experimenta (<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/106181453\">Jeff Frost’s Circle of Abstract Ritual</a>) and a stopmotion co-directed by an 11-year-old (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1947663027/me-and-ewe-0\">Trinity and Barry Andersson’s Me &amp; Ewe</a>). Amid this deluge of digital diversity, there were glimpses of somebody literally sticking their neck on the line – as in <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/387675441/first-to-fall-feature-length-documentary-film\">First to Fall</a>, Rachel Beth Anderson and Tim Gruca’s close-range report on Libyan freedom fighters. (Truly, the recoil from rocket launchers is something to behold.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LU-ceXM5pY\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LU-ceXM5pY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The night’s crowdpleaser, however, came from closer to home: snippets of <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1961548517/all-new-adventures-of-morph-from-aardman-animation\">Aardman’s All New Adventures of Morph</a>, still winding up the hapless Chas, yet now getting down with the kids – turning his tiny clay hands to DJing and stand-up – without the naff Cowell-courting of, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/06/postman-pat-the-movie-3d-trailer-review\">Postman Pat: The Movie</a>. Though these, too, raised economic questions – should Aardman, lately attached to Sony and StudioCanal, really be soliciting public coin to finance its webisodes? – the throwback chuckles they sparked reminded us a safe bet can itself be a thing of joy. Kickstarter may just have found a posterboy less whitebread than Zach Braff: crafty, creative, adaptable Morph.</p>","headline":"Kickstarter: Morph biggest hit at festival celebrating cinema in

The character was introduced in Frank Miller’s seminal 1986 graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, and has been called the first full-time female version of Batman’s best-known sidekick in the DC Comics title.</p> <p>The news broke through the WILX-10 News station in Michigan, where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has been filming at the Michigan State University. The extra told reporter Kirk Montgomery: “I’ve also learned that the character of Robin is now female.” Meanwhile, Malone has been spotted on set and at recent film premieres sporting Kelley’s trademark red crop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jun/17/man-steel-zack-snyder-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1923445\"                data-video-name=\"Man of Steel: interview with director Zack Snyder - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/6/17/1371467861340/Man-of-Steel-director-Zac-026.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-410937131\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/6/17/1371467859978/Man-of-Steel-director-Zac-025.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/17/130717ManofSteel-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/17/130717ManofSteel/130717ManofSteel.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/17/130717ManofSteel-720.mp4\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Studio Warner Bros has not yet made any public comment on the rumour. However, several US sites are reporting that the extra in question now faces a possible $5m fine for breaking a non-disclosure agreement.<br />Batman v Superman, the followup to Zack Snyder’s 2013 superhero epic Man of Steel, will feature Affleck taking on Henry Cavill’s Superman. The film already looks set to be a crowded affair, with a debut for Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman and potential bows for Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and Ray Fisher’s Cyborg.</p> <p>Snyder is said to be riffing heavily on<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Returns\"> The Dark Knight Returns</a>, which sees an older, jaded Batman coming into conflict with Superman after the latter is called in to take down an increasingly out-of-control dark knight. Kelley is a 13-year-old schoolgirl in the comics, somewhat younger than the 29-year-old Malone. </p> <p>While the introduction of a new movie Robin would usually prove controversial with fans, the cache of Miller’s classic graphic novel could yet make the character’s big screen debut a popular move. Dawn of Justice is due in cinemas for March 2016.</p>","headline":"Holy smokes!

As the four children scrap and bicker and make up and fall out again, one completely fails to sink into the drama. My mind was saying things like, oh look, there’s that Pete Townshend-looking dude from Girls (Adam Driver); ah, Michael Bluth, welcome back (Jason Bateman); Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), as I live and breathe! And so on.</p> <p>The only person of whom this is not true is La Bella Fonda because, well, she’s Jane goddamn Fonda, fool. The woman is an icon, a cultural touchstone and a political rebel who still polarises America. Although she was never a rock-solid box-office phenomenon, she was absolutely the most important American actress of the 1970s. The fact that she’s now playing a sexually feisty grandmother with a ridiculous boob job in a middling comedy can never undermine all that. Nor her oddly misshapen recent partial comeback, in which she has, inter alia, played opposite Jennifer Lopez and Lindsey Lohan. I particularly enjoyed two performances, mainly for the nerve of the stunt-casting involved: as Nancy Reagan in The Butler, and when she – the ex-wife of CNN founder Ted Turner, no less – played the nasty cable news network owner in The Newsroom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH0cEP0mvlU\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH0cEP0mvlU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The 70s were bracketed by well-deserved Oscars in 71 and 78 (for Klute and Coming Home); by long-term alienation from her father over her political activities (and he was the consummate liberal, so she must have really bugged him) and their reconciliation on the set of On Golden Pond; by the distance between Tout Va Bien, for Godard in 1972, and The Jane Fonda Workout, which drove the VCR revolution; and between husband No 2, Chicago Seven member Tom Hayden, and his hi-tech redneck successor Turner. In between, she hung out with the North Vietnamese leadership, the Black Panthers, and the Indian rights activists occupying Alcatraz Island, named her son after a Vietnamese man who tried to assassinate Robert McNamara, got greylisted by the major studios for a while, and was bugged by the National Security Agency (always ahead of the curve!). Apart from the Hollywood Ten, I can’t think of a single other movie artist who lived out their radicalism so fully for so long. To my teenage self, who wanted to join Baader-Meinhof and rob banks hand-in-hand with my dead-eyed dream-date Magdalena Kopp, she was the ultimate Hollywood bad girl, always pissing off the right people. If John McCain still hates her, so much the better.</p> <p>With all that behind her, I can surely forgive This Is Where I Leave You, though she’s the best thing in it by a mile.</p>","headline":"This Is Where I Leave You: Jane Fonda steals the show","trailText":"Shawn Levy’s ensemble comedy features everyone from Tina Fey to Adam Driver.

She played out seven of 13 episodes as a convict girl in the Australian television series Luke’s Kingdom. There are, however, no such blemishes in her role as French mistress at an Edwardian girls’ school in the haunting film Picnic at Hanging Rock which recently opened in London.</p> <p>She arrived in London in the publicity van for Picnic, and with something else to be pleased about: a best actress award from the San Sebastian Film Festival for her title role in Caddie, the story of a young woman making her way through life during the Australian depression. Her own career as an actress, however, bears the marks of being something less than a depressing struggle.<br /></p> <p>She made her first grand entrance at the age of five, leaping out of a tree for a part in the school Rumpelstiltskin in Melbourne. She took part in the usual round of school and local drama groups, but never gave the stage any serious thought until she attended, at 16, a Melbourne Theatre Company workshop for schools. Two things happened: she became fascinated by the technical and structural complexity of stagecraft, and she simultaneously realised its potential for magic during a visit by the Black Theatre of Prague. She went on to drama school for two years.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv5aWlkQmEk\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hv5aWlkQmEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Things didn’t happen after that, so she made them happen. She and other graduates financed, mounted and acted in a production of Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey in a hired theatre in the old Sydney Women’s Prison, and invited every entrepreneur, impresario, agent, producer and director in Sydney. They were very young and very excited and their enthusiasm must have steamed across the footlights, because people took notice: all of them got work, and for Helen Morse, it snowballed.<br /></p> <p>She is now 29, and married to Australian producer and director Sandy Harbutt. In the 10 years since that production she has been out of work three times, for periods of only four or five months; Shaw and Shakespeare in the city theatres and the small halls during tours of the outback, television roles, and now films.

Although very different in form, content and, indeed, success (Gibney’s film was Bafta-nominated, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/27/fifth-estate-2103-biggest-movie-turkey\" title=\"\">Condon’s was hailed as one of the year’s biggest flops</a>), both movies wrestled with the conundrum of separating the cult of Assange’s divisive personality from the significance of the information that he helped to publish – for better or worse.</p> <p>There’s a similar tension at the heart of <em>Citizenfour</em>, which intimately documents whistleblower Edward Snowden’s efforts to lift the lid on the intrusive post-9/11 US eavesdropping industry. Yet unlike Assange (who appears briefly), Snowden shows no signs of wanting to be the centre of <em>any</em> story; on the contrary, he seems positively camera-shy as Oscar-nominee Laura Poitras captures him in a Hong Kong hotel room in 2013, over eight tense days during which his revelations are first made public. Accompanied by the contrastingly gregarious Glenn Greenwald and the <em>Guardian</em>’s meticulous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ewenmacaskill\" title=\"\">Ewen MacAskill</a>, Snowden attempts to weigh up the importance of standing up to be counted against the possibility of the story becoming about <em>him</em>, rather than his information. With winning candour, he admits that he has no experience of the media and is eager to hand over decisions about what should be revealed, and when, to people whom he trusts to know better – another stark contrast with Assange’s more egomaniacal approach.</p> <p>Key to Snowden’s trust is Poitras, who earned herself a place on the Department of Homeland Security’s “watch list” with 2006’s <em>My Country, My Country</em> (about life under US occupation in Iraq) and 2010’s <em>The Oath</em> (filmed in Yemen and Guantánamo) and here builds upon her 2012 short <em>The Program</em>, wherein NSA whistleblower William Binney revealed how technology designed to gather foreign intelligence was used “to spy on US citizens without warrants”.</p> <p>An NSA contractor employed by Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden became similarly alarmed that he was “designing systems to amplify state power”. Encrypted emails to Poitras led to clandestine encounters of the kind that normally only happen in spy movies, replete with coded exchanges (“Do you know the restaurant’s opening hours?”) in exotic foreign locales. After their secretive sojourn in Hong Kong, during which the bulk of <em>Citizenfour</em> was filmed, the various parties dispersed, with the now outlawed Snowden seeking refuge in Russia, Greenwald returning to Rio and Poitras heading to Berlin to complete her film in secrecy.</p> <p>The film’s final stanza, which was carefully “redacted” until the New York premiere last Friday, reunites the central characters in Russia, where they share a broken conversation in which key words are scribbled on notepads rather than spoken aloud (for fear of listening devices) and then shredded before the camera’s prying eyes. John le Carré couldn’t have made this stuff up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/17/judge-northern-soul-palo-alto-citizenfour-film-video-reviews\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2177291\"                data-video-name=\"The Judge, Northern Soul, Palo Alto and Citizenfour: Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/17/1413537715583/Robert-Downey-Jr-and-Robe-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-449992947\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/17/1413537711603/Robert-Downey-Jr-and-Robe-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/17/141016TGFSTheJudge-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/17/141016TGFSTheJudge.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/17/141016TGFSTheJudge_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/17/141016TGFSTheJudge/141016TGFSTheJudge.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/17/141016TGFSTheJudge_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch a video review of Citizenfour</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with so much of her previous work, Poitras’s documentary dramatically straddles the divide between art and journalism, cinema and reportage. The trailer for <em>Citizenfour</em>, which warns that “every border you cross, every purchase you make, every call you dial... is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not”, plays it as the most chilling thriller of the year, and that’s no an idle boast; there is tension here to rival any of executive producer Steven Soderbergh’s taut dramas.</p> <p>Outside of the interviews, Poitras presents us with lines of dot-dash lights that could be digital code, but gradually come into focus as the overhead illuminations of a long, dark tunnel – the rabbit hole down which we must travel. An ominous, rumbling score adds menace, suspended chords and electronic creaks suggesting a descent into some Stygian world. Even in the brightly lit hotel rooms, the sound continues to alarm, the shrieking bell of a suspiciously timed fire drill setting our subjects’ nerves on edge – and ours.</p> <p>Revelations that every phone and mobile device can be remotely used as a bug (at one point, Snowden hides beneath a cowl to protect his keystrokes) crank up the tension further still; when a mobile phone went off in the early screening I attended, the audience’s annoyance was tempered by all-too-nervous laughter. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who went home and took the battery out of their mobile.</p> <p>At times I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/this-is-not-a-film\" title=\"\">Jafar Panahi’s <em>This Is Not a Film</em></a>, which found the Iranian auteur covertly making movies while under house arrest in Tehran. Elsewhere, there are echoes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/31/internets-own-boy-review-aaron-swartz-mark-kermode\" title=\"\"><em>The Internet’s Own Boy</em></a> and the youthful altruism of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/aaron-swartz\" title=\"\">Aaron Swartz</a>; one sequence in which Snowden attempts to disguise himself via the application of hair gel would not look out of place in a John Hughes movie, his now familiar tousled cut, specs and preppy smile suggesting a wide-eyed naivety at odds with his apparent understanding (and acceptance) of the magnitude of his actions. It’s a moment of light relief amid a movie of brooding darkness – bravely made and utterly engrossing.</p>","headline":"Citizenfour review – Edward Snowden documentary is utterly

This is purely because, when he took me to see it in 1985, I immediately embarked upon such a sustained series of full-volume terror-fits that we were forced to leave halfway though. I was four years old. Who takes a four-year-old to see a film with decapitated heads in it, though? An idiot, that’s who.</p> <p>I can’t tell you the name of the film that caused me the most psychological distress, either, because I don’t actually know it. I know it was broadcast on TV in the late 1980s. I know that I only saw the ending, in which a woman has a breakdown, chops off all her hair, smears her face with lipstick, goes to a theatre and murders a man onstage with a machine-gun while screaming and cackling. I know it singlehandedly prevented me from getting a proper amount of sleep for about six months. But I have no idea what it was called. If you know, please tell me. It’s been 25 years, and I’m desperate for closure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-baad76b5-7b53-420a-b23c-e512c38e5901\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413887463195/1d5ccc8a-5cc6-421d-a685-f5f53656a2f2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"sadako ringu ring japanese horror\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baddie hair day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Omega</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which leaves Hideo Nakata’s Ring (Ringu). Again, I first saw this on television a couple of years after its theatrical release, with my university housemates. It was heavily trailed, both by Channel 4 and everyone who’d seen it, as one of the scariest films ever made. But we were obnoxious, ironic students, and the main reason we watched it was to prove the consensus wrong. This, in retrospect, was stupid.<br /></p> <p>The film’s first couple of scares were unsettling, but schlocky enough for us to laugh off. Then, as the plot became more unsettlingly obtuse, the laughter began to die down. And then the phone rang. And then Sadako crawled out of the well. And then she didn’t stop crawling, and we all found ourselves involuntarily pushing against the back of the sofa in a doomed bid to somehow get to the other side where everything was safe. Then came the close-up. We all yelped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Z-MOqAvtY\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9Z-MOqAvtY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>As the film ended, we all just sat there, numb. We turned the television off. Thankfully, it stayed off. Nobody spoke for ages. Eventually, someone – I forget who – quietly piped up and said that they wanted to go to bed, but they didn’t want to go upstairs alone. So we all traipsed upstairs together like bloody <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo#mediaviewer/File:Scooby-gang-1969.jpg\">Mystery Incorporated</a>, all just because we’d just seen a film about a spooky VHS.</p> <p>Enough time has passed now for me to realise that Ring is less a film and more packaging for a single scene. And that scene is just a slightly updated version of the old unstoppable baddie trope. Really, there’s nothing really to separate Sadako from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF2OcMjMnR4#t=2m10s\">Count Orlok</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/the-shining-heres-johnny-scariest-movie-scene-jack-nicholson\">Jack Torrance</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/02/freddy-krueger-nightmare-elm-street\">Freddy Krueger</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/feb/22/killer-robots-in-film-in-pictures-alien-blade-runner-terminator?index=9\">The Terminator</a>.</p> <p>But in the moment, watching it for the very first time, it was like living through a nightmare. The only way I could console myself after watching Ring was to remember that the television in my bedroom was on top of a wardrobe, and that Sadako would topple out and break her neck if she ever tried any of that crap with me. Genuinely, that was a comfort.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/ring-nakata-ringu-horror\">Ring: 12th best horror of all time</a></li> </ul>","headline":"Ring: the film that frightened me most","trailText":"Japanese cult horror Ringu scared <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong> (and a whole houseful of his friends) rigid.

That same spirit started to show on set, with the cast deciding they wanted to experience the venture in the same way as the WI women. They were determined to be nude, even when it wasn’t needed for the camera, for face shots and that kind of thing.</p> <p>This made it harder for me: however strategically we placed vegetables, bits kept showing through and we’d have to reshoot. Even after we’d finished and cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/features.review\">the film</a>, there were things popping out that shouldn’t have been – and a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing all the private parts.</p> <p>Although the nude scenes only took a week, it felt like a year. The more you know you shouldn’t look, the more you want to, and I noticed the film crew keeping very busy, working far harder than they normally do because they didn’t want to be caught gazing. It was a challenge as a director having to confront veteran actors who were completely naked. I’ve never made so much eye contact in my life. I’d offered to strip myself, so we were all in it together. That might have made it easier for me, but the offer was declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1_QH57InDo\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_QH57InDo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The actors were very supportive of each other: a bottle of champagne would be waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene. They were all women in their 50s and 60s and were thrilled by roles that recognised their sensuality. After one nude shoot, I recall having to tell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> to put her robe back on three or four times.</p> <p>It was rare for a film to focus on middle-aged women and not just show them as mothers or aunties. But this made it harder to cast the male parts: several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women. Also, it was the era of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84830/billy.elliot\">Billy Elliot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/69487/full.monty\">The Full Monty</a>, and I was keen to make a film about northern England that was not about poverty and deprivation. These were middle-aged, middle-class women who wanted to break out of the mould. I remember waiting at Skipton station to be collected by Helen Mirren’s real-life counterpart. Every time a battered old Ford came along, I thought that must be her. Then a black BMW roared up blaring rock music and there she was at the wheel. It brought home to me how guilty we all are of stereotyping.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/12/celia-imrie-this-much-know\"><strong>Celia Imrie</strong></a><strong>, actor</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab453c13920ddce40e84fb09551e7330818c34a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413825568781/6cfd0a8b-e0e0-4e71-b234-be65de0476ae-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Celia Imrie in Calendar Girls\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celia Imrie: ‘Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Touchstone/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can’t bear taking my clothes off. I have never been a pretty young thing and stripping off is far more daring when you don’t have a figure to die for. But I love a challenge and there was never any question of us wearing flesh-coloured coverings. That would have been a cheat. The real-life calendar girls taught all of us in the cast not to take ourselves too seriously – and Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on.</p> <p>I was the first. I had first-night-style nerves beforehand but, given that my character was supposed to be nervous, the anxiety actually helped. And the rest of the cast made a big fuss of me afterwards in my dressing room, where they’d set out champagne and Twiglets.</p> <p>We shot some scenes in the village where the original calendar girls lived. It made us realise how daring they’d been: it’s a very small community and there were a lot of objectors. We were staying in a hotel with a gym and, although I loathe them, I thought I’d better use it, given what I was facing. I crept down at 6am when I thought it would be empty. But when I opened the door, the rest of the cast were already in there working out.</p> <p>Since the film came out, I’m used to being called Bigger Buns now. A girl shouted it when she saw me out walking once, which was embarrassing. I prefer to remember the rather handsome young man in Paris who caught my eye in the street, looked down at my chest and declared: “Les grands gâteaux!”</p> <h2>More on Calendar Girls</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/29/calendar-girls\">Peter Bradshaw’s original review</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/features.review\">Mark Kermode’s original review</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/30/features.johnpatterson\">John Patterson meets Helen Mirren</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/01/1\">Simon Hattenstone meets Julie Walters</a></p>","headline":"How we made ...

Hager in her arched position, rendered the scene technically ineffective. Years later, when a director’s cut was released and CGI technology was readily available, this disturbing scene was included.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebi5zuL03Wc\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ebi5zuL03Wc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Rocky</h2> <p>Would any discussion of scenes involving stairs be complete without including the Italian Stallion himself hammering his way up the 72 stone steps outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art?

supporters have it, Kickstarter is an initiative made for our austere moment. At last, they cry, a brand that makes spreadsheets sexy, makes panhandling productive. As anyone who’s ever thrown in a fiver for a pal’s ill-fated Bobby Davro biopic knows, the company’s model has been shrewdly formulated. Cash-strapped creatives pitch projects with an eye to raising public backing; we chip in and get the feature, short or video game anticipated, or – if the minimum target isn’t raised – our money back. It’s a no-win/no-fee way to crowdfund, hive-mind and exit-poll all at once.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/events/filmfest2014\">Kickstarter film fest</a>, which concluded its first UK run this past weekend in London, fell at the end of a tricky year for the company. Blogger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/21/kickstarter-above-the-game-ban\">Ken Hoinsky</a>’s hands-on seduction treatise, <a href=\"https://www.dosomething.org/petition/kickstarter\">Above the Game: A Guide to Getting Awesome With Women</a>, and multimillionaire Zach Braff’s autobiographical drama, Wish I Was Here (general response: I wish I weren’t) hinted that the company’s anything-goes model had become open to exploitation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0445db0aa70c7e22785e6ef61c8a0befad8321c3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413803362999/8330196c-6d4d-4a41-8a75-e849e5e1eb19-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Zach Braff's autobiographical Wish I Was Here.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zach Braff’s autobiographical Wish I Was Here.

Shouldn’t art be about more than mere book-balancing? Aren’t Kickstarter’s greenlighted projects, by definition, safe bets?</p> <p>The Saturday night showcase event at Prince Charles Cinema suggested possibly not, and that the company still has plenty to be proud about. Take the support it generated for Gillian Robespierre’s quietly radical comedy Obvious Child, whose <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910274/keywords\">IMDb keywords</a> (“abortion”, “reproductive rights”, “peeing in street”) presumably precluded even the modest studio backing afforded to the comparatively timid Juno.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/aug/29/obvious-child-jenny-slate-romantic-comedy-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2149461\"                data-video-name=\"Obvious Child star Jenny Slate: 'I miss romantic comedies where women are complex' – video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/29/1409302788847/Jenny-Slate-and-Gillian-R-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-445772749\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/29/1409302785970/Jenny-Slate-and-Gillian-R-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/29/140827ObviousChild/140827ObviousChild.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>The company’s logo similarly adorns this year’s Sundance documentary prize-winner, the sincere poverty study <a href=\"http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13938/rich_hill\">Rich Hill</a>, and the short films of Planet Money, an NPR offshoot that rigorously and ingeniously illustrates how the world works.</p> <p>In such cases, Kickstarter functions as a virtual sibling to such progressively minded mini-studios as Jeff Skoll’s Participant Media or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/feb/18/megan-ellison-producer-the-master\">Megan Ellison</a>’s Annapurna Pictures. It’s enabled both neophytes such as Mike Flanagan, whose unsettling Kickstarted debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa1UJLqYeBU\">Absentia</a>, prefigured this year’s effective multiplex horror <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oculus\">Oculus</a>, and indie veteran Alexandre Rockwell of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkE5jfZg_k0\">In the Soup</a>, whose crowdsourced comeback Little Feet suggests what a Jim Jarmusch kid’s film might be like. (While pushing a stuffed mallard round, our pint-sized magician hero turns to his pal, a tubby sort in a sailor’s cap, and remarks: “Best thing is you don’t have to feed him.”)<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LINrvLg5vyc\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LINrvLg5vyc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><br />Sometimes, its users are clearly just taking a punt, such as the 846 optimists who chipped in for Andrew Harmer’s <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1538713376/the-fitzroy\">The Fitzroy</a>, a British variant on Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s early, grubby fantasias. Shown back to back, the trailer for David Sandberg’s VHS-influenced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RqpItxd8M\">Kung Fury</a>, about an 80s cop sent back in time to defeat Hitler (AKA the Kung Führer), and the project video for Kyle Rankin’s <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1364524925/night-of-the-living-deb-a-feature-film\">Night of the Living Deb</a> demonstrated how even sales pitches have become more inventive under the company’s aegis: the former offers far richer visual and comedic pickings than 2012’s crowdfunded Nazis-on-the-moon saga<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146523/iron-sky\"> Iron Sky</a>, while the latter sees Rankin’s read-through with star Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) interrupted by a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Doubtless hundreds more splatterfests await a greenlight. Relatively few organisations, however, can claim to have also facilitated documentaries on Indian puppeteers (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1567618329/tomorrow-we-disappear\">Tomorrow We Disappear</a>) and Finnish cowboys (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1087720796/aatsinki-the-story-of-arctic-cowboys\">Aatsinki</a>), Michael Snow-like experimenta (<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/106181453\">Jeff Frost’s Circle of Abstract Ritual</a>) and a stopmotion co-directed by an 11-year-old (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1947663027/me-and-ewe-0\">Trinity and Barry Andersson’s Me &amp; Ewe</a>). Amid this deluge of digital diversity, there were glimpses of somebody literally sticking their neck on the line – as in <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/387675441/first-to-fall-feature-length-documentary-film\">First to Fall</a>, Rachel Beth Anderson and Tim Gruca’s close-range report on Libyan freedom fighters. (Truly, the recoil from rocket launchers is something to behold.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LU-ceXM5pY\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LU-ceXM5pY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The night’s crowdpleaser, however, came from closer to home: snippets of <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1961548517/all-new-adventures-of-morph-from-aardman-animation\">Aardman’s All New Adventures of Morph</a>, still winding up the hapless Chas, yet now getting down with the kids – turning his tiny clay hands to DJing and stand-up – without the naff Cowell-courting of, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/06/postman-pat-the-movie-3d-trailer-review\">Postman Pat: The Movie</a>. Though these, too, raised economic questions – should Aardman, lately attached to Sony and StudioCanal, really be soliciting public coin to finance its webisodes? – the throwback chuckles they sparked reminded us a safe bet can itself be a thing of joy. Kickstarter may just have found a posterboy less whitebread than Zach Braff: crafty, creative, adaptable Morph.</p>","headline":"Kickstarter: Morph biggest hit at festival celebrating cinema in
