It was written by John Brooks, a writer for the New Yorker in the 1950s and 1960s. And, yes, it is actually very good.</p><p><strong>That's a surprise.

tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Half-man, half-woman, all-compromise.</p><p><strong>Isn't merde a rude French word? </strong>It is. It's also a portmanteau of Merkel and Hollande, the old German chancellor and the new French president.</p><p><strong>So it's the new Merkozy? </strong>Exactly. But much less cosy than the old one.</p><p><strong>Because? </strong>Because unlike Mer and Kozy, Mer and&nbsp;De grew up on very different sides of the political tracks. She's an austerity-loving conservative and he's a stimulus-seeking socialist&nbsp;elected on the back of a pledge to renegotiate the eurozone's fiscal pact.</p><p><strong>Is that a problem? </strong>It is.</p><p><strong>Why so? </strong>Because Merkel insists that the fiscal pact is simply \"not up for debate\". She claims if they open up negotiations on the agreement, Greece will demand to renegotiate the troika package, other countries will follow suit and then everything that's ever been agreed in Europe since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia will have to be thrown out and rewritten from scratch. At which point every town, village and remote clifftop lighthouse in Europe will be simultaneously rendered worthless, ransacked by&nbsp;looters and set on fire.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a pretty intractable position she's got there. </strong>Nah, it's more flexible than it looks.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Yup. Hollande's off to see Merkel tomorrow afternoon as soon as he's been sworn in and experts reckon the pair should agree a compromise in no time.</p><p><strong>How exactly? </strong>By putting the fiscal pact to one side and putting together a \"growth pact\" to run alongside it, thus allowing both to walk away from discussions with their heads held high. The key question is whether the growth pact will be – as many supporters of Hollande are hoping – built around a fiscal stimulus funded by&nbsp;further borrowing, or – as Merkel's government is insisting it will have to be – a series of measures to&nbsp;improve European competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Hold on. Isn't \"measures to improve European competitiveness\" just another term for austerity? </strong>Pretty much, yep. That'd be why the French are saying \"Merde!\".</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"Merkel + Hollande = Merde ...\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"... so does Monti + Cameron = Moron?\"</p>","headline":"Pass notes, No 3,174: Merde","trailText":"<p>The only word for an uneasy compromise, soon to be found right at the very heart of the
