And that surname seems to ring a bell.</strong> Yes&nbsp;indeed. She is the little sister of international pop ostrich <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyoncé</a> Knowles, and thus also the sister-in-law of middle-aged rap tycoon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz\" title=\"\">Jay Z</a>.</p><p><strong>Right. And what does Solange do? Or is she just a&nbsp;professional relative?</strong> Not at all. She's a singer in her own right and, it now turns out, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/12/solange-knowles-attacks-jay-z-hotel-tmz-video\" title=\"\">a tightly wound coil of rage</a>.</p><p><strong>Well, it must be kind of annoying when your big&nbsp;sister is already the most successful person in the world at exactly what you want to do.</strong> Yes,&nbsp;although most recently it was Jay Z she was&nbsp;annoyed with. As <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2014/05/12/jay-z-solange-fight-elevator-video-beyonce-met-gala/\" title=\"\">the gossip site TMZ so delightfully showed the world</a>, the three of them&nbsp;were in a lift together in a hotel last week, along with a very large man who was probably a&nbsp;bodyguard.</p><p><strong>Uh-huh.</strong> Pretty much as soon as they got in, Solange started screaming at Jay Z, attacked him&nbsp;with a hail of punches and kicks, and whacked him with a diamante clutch bag.</p><p><strong>What was she so angry about?</strong> Sadly, we don't know. All we have is silent video footage apparently from a security camera at the Standard&nbsp;Hotel in New York. What was behind the assault is currently obsessing the internet.</p><p><strong>Maybe it's just an attack of artistic differences?</strong> Could be. Solange danced with her big sister's band <a href=\"http://www.destinyschild.com\" title=\"\">Destiny's Child</a> when she was a teenager, but went solo long ago and became, according to music bloggers, a much more credible musician than Beyoncé or Jay Z.</p><p><strong>Ooh, I bet that feels good.</strong> Yes. And the fashion world loves her. Plus she has an eye for a \"hip\" collaborator and has worked with artists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/08/kendrick-lamar-good-kid-maaad-city\" title=\"\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/27/dev-hynes-solange-blood-orange-sound-of-pop-2013-interview\" title=\"\">Dev Hynes</a>, with whom she made her&nbsp;2012 single<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy9W_mrY_Vk\" title=\"\"> Losing You</a>. It proved to be&nbsp;prophetic.</p><p><strong>How so?</strong> She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/solange-dev-hynes-twitter-feud-beyonce\" title=\"\">publicly fell out with Hynes soon&nbsp;afterwards</a>.</p><p><strong>Ah. And would I like her music?</strong> Judge for yourself. She has a new album coming out this year.</p><p><strong>Well I never. She'll need to do something big to&nbsp;get it noticed.</strong> Good idea.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"She's the artisanal Beyoncé.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"She's the musical Tyson.\"</p><p><em>• This article was amended on 13 May 2014. The original asked what Jay Z had done to warrant the alleged attack, and said Knowles got in what looks like a good clout with a clutch bag. These have been corrected.</em></p>","headline":"Who is Solange Knowles and why is she apparently beating up Jay Z?","trailText":"<p>The internet is wild over a video that purports to show Beyoncé's hip little sister scrapping with her brother-in-law inside a hotel lift.

Jacob, for instance, which Noah replaced at the top, is a classic big peak, centred around 2000 and now in steady decline. Noah's summit has been flatter, but it is expected to fall away too.

Was there a surge in American babies called Maximus around Gladiator? </strong>Actually, yes. A little surge, anyway. It shot up from 850th in 2000 to 311th in 2001. It's 200th now.</p><p><strong>People are weird. </strong>Especially people who have just had babies.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"Noah R! Please share nicely with Noah B.

The doctorate is sort of an honorary thing.</p><p><strong>I was going to say that he sounds a bit overqualified. </strong>He's doing all right: Dr Dre is about to become rap's richest man.</p><p><strong>Is he not already?</strong> The title currently belongs to P&nbsp;Diddy, who according to Forbes is worth $700m. But Dr Dre, former NWA member, Grammy-winning producer and Eminem and 50 Cent collaborator, now looks set to surpass him.</p><p><strong>Wow. I had no idea there was so much money in misogynist rhyming.</strong> There isn't quite. Dr Dre's big payday would come <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/09/apple-looks-set-to-buy-dr-dre-beats-electronics\" title=\"\">from the sale of his Beats headphones empire to Apple</a>.</p><p><strong>Wow. I had no idea there was so much money in headphones. </strong>If there is it's due largely to Dr Dre and his partner, Jimmy Iovine, who started Beats Electronics in 2008. They made headphones fashionable, imbuing them with a streetwise, overpriced cool that only Apple's money can buy.</p><p><strong>Roughly how much money are we talking about?</strong> With the sales of Beats Electronics and its fledging music streaming service, Beats Music, about $3.2bn</p><p><strong>Come again? </strong>It's a big number. If it goes ahead it will be Apple's largest ever acquisition.</p><p><strong>And Dr Dre will be hip-hop's first billionaire!</strong> That's what the headlines say.

He co-founded Beats, but last year Carlyle Group acquired a minority shareholding for $500m. His present stake is thought to be somewhere between 20 and 25%.</p><p><strong>Which means?</strong> That after the sale – and after tax – Dre will be worth $800m; ahead of Diddy and Jay Z, but some way shy of his first billion.</p><p><strong>Well he can always play a few concerts if he needs some cash. </strong>Or he could release his long-awaited but yet-to-arrive album Detox. Some say it was shelved to prevent a lukewarm reception damaging the Beats brand.</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"He reached millions with his music, and made millions with his headphones.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"Doctor, I'm having a slight problem with my hearing.\"</p>","headline":"Dr Dre's Apple deal will make him the richest man in hip-hop","trailText":"The rapper and producer has made headphones cool again.

These are <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/05/02/meet-the-glocker-moms/199128\" title=\"\">Glocker Moms</a>. They are basically the same, except they own a gun and hate liberals.</p><p><strong>As in Glock, the renowned Austrian handgun manufacturer? </strong>You catch on fast.</p><p><strong>This sounds to me like an American thing. </strong>Right again. The National Rifle Association (NRA) claims that a quarter of the attendees at its recent annual meeting in Indianapolis were women, up from, at best, 5-10% a decade ago. It also put a huge poster of a female gun activist on the front of the building and handed out \"I'm an NRA MOM\" badges on the door.</p><p><strong>It must be very pleased with this development.</strong> Yes, pleased. And also probably keen to make the most of it. On the one&nbsp;hand, more American women do <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/self-reported-gun-ownership-highest-1993.aspx\" title=\"\">seem to be&nbsp;developing a love of guns</a>. The number of female-held gun permits in Indiana, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/life/2014/04/24/armed-gun-permits-indiana-women-percent/8095055/\" title=\"\">has risen by almost 43%</a> in the past two years, and there are certainly more pink guns, targets and holsters on the market.</p><p><strong>What sane woman wouldn't want one of those?</strong> Indeed. On the other hand, gun manufacturers, which supply much of the NRA's funding, need to appeal to women and minorities to find future growth. Plus this is a very convenient riposte to <a href=\"https://www.momsdemandaction.org/\" title=\"\">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>, a growing group of anti-gun activists that <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/24/the-nra-s-worst-nightmare-is-america-s-moms.html\" title=\"\">sprang up following the Sandy Hook massacre</a>.</p><p><strong>Good idea. Bad name.</strong> That's your opinion. But they are not to be trifled with, despite their peaceful nature.</p><p><strong>Why would lots of women suddenly want a&nbsp;gun&nbsp;anyway?</strong> Mostly for protection from men,&nbsp;they say. Although statistics show that women with access to firearms <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/having-a-gun-in-the-house-doesnt-make-a-woman-safer/284022/\" title=\"\">are much more likely to become homicide victims</a> – and to a&nbsp;greater extent than male gun-owners.</p><p><strong>Perhaps it's just that they don't have quite enough guns&nbsp;yet?</strong> The US already owns vastly&nbsp;more guns&nbsp;per person, as well as having a&nbsp;higher rate&nbsp;of&nbsp;gun deaths, than any other developed country.</p><p><strong>What about giving every household their own vat of anthrax?

They could do some damage.\"</p><p><strong>Especially if you're a smaller fish. </strong>Well, obviously. The shark's jaws can snap forward almost to the end of its snout – which, incidentally, is crammed with electrical sensors to help it find prey.</p><p><strong>Isn't nature amazing? </strong>As the last surviving member of <a href=\"http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/family/316\" title=\"\">the Mitsukurinidae family</a>, which dates back some 125m years, the goblin shark is sometimes

She has already proved provocative enough to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/NEIN-zu-Conchita-Wurst-beim-Song-Contest/723559711002948\" title=\"\">irritate conservatives at home</a>, and now <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/28/uk-austria-eurovision-drag-idUKKBN0DE06O20140428\" title=\"\">protests against her have spread to Belarus, Armenia and Russia</a>.</p><p><strong>Again, I wouldn't put annoying uptight people quite in the stratosphere, achievement-wise. </strong>Perhaps not, but it may not be the end of the matter. A petition has been launched in all three countries, demanding that the organisers should remove Wurst from the show, or that broadcasters should edit her out.</p><p><strong>Is that fair?</strong> Of course it's not fair, especially since the result is partly decided by the viewing public. But the petitioners have more worrying things than unfairness on their minds.</p><p><strong>Like what? </strong>\"European liberals\" and \"a hotbed of sodomy\", <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/04/27/eurovision-petitions-calls-for-removal-of-austrian-bearded-drag-queen/\" title=\"\">at least in one translation</a>. The whole issue could yet become a flashpoint between eastern and western Europe.</p><p><strong>Oh good. We could use another one of those. What's the song actually like? </strong>Oh you know, kitsch, overblown, semi-funny. It's called Rise Like a Phoenix and would make a good theme tune for a cross-dressing Bond film.</p><p><strong>So much like any other Eurovision song? </strong>More or less.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"Eurovision must be saved!\"</p><p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"Eurovision must be shaved!\"</p>","headline":"Is this Austrian drag queen making Eurovision a 'hotbed of sodomy'?","trailText":"<p>No, obviously not.
