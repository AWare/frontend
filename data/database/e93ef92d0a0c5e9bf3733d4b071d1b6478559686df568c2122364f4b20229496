They have previously rejected proposals for plaques outside the former homes of Bob Marley, Elizabeth Taylor and even Thora Hird – a decision<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895094\" title=\"\"> that provoked criticism</a>.</p><p>It is perhaps no surprise, then, that English Heritage's decision to appoint a slew of celebrities to join them in their deliberations has caused outrage – and, indeed, resignations.</p><p>The <em>Observer</em> has learned that two members of the panel felt forced to quit three weeks ago. Their resignations were provoked by the appointment of the man who brought <em>Big Brother</em> to the UK and who is now chair of the arts council, Sir Peter Bazalgette; FA chairman Greg Dyke; the broadcaster and art dealer Philip Mould; scientist and TV presenter professor Lord (Robert) Winston; TV host and physicist Professor Brian Cox and banker Rupert Hambro.</p><p>David Edgerton, professor of the history of science and technology at King's College, London, one of the two rebels, along with the prizewinning architectural journalist Gillian Darley, said: \"Instead of a <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/who-we-are/how-we-are-run/committees-and-panels/blueplaquespanel/\" title=\"\">blue plaques panel</a>, English Heritage are creating a white-men-off-the-telly panel, with a banker added.</p><p>\"It is hardly expert, especially in history, and is not representative. Such a panel may wish to fund its own plaque scheme, but it should not call itself the blue plaques panel, nor should a scheme advised by such a panel be in receipt of public money. People are not so dumb that they want their blue plaques decided on by people they might have seen on television.\"</p><p>Edgerton, a historian and a panel member for six years, who only learned of the new appointments when he examined the addressees of the agenda to the next meeting, said he feared the appointments had been made purely to encourage donations. He said: \"English Heritage is the custodian of the blue plaques panel, not its owner. Proposers, supporters and the public will rightly expect the blue plaques panel to be expert, particularly in history. They will also expect it to be representative so that plaques are awarded to people distinguished in all fields, including those currently under-represented.\"</p><p>Darley, an architectural correspondent at the <em>Observer</em> in the 1990s and biographer of the social reformer Octavia Hill, said she was appalled by the lack of female names among the appointments. She added that she also felt that the panel's important role was being undermined and that others on it were considering their positions. \"The appointments are all male and, with the exception of Brian Cox, they are all over 60,\" Darley said. \"And the other point is that they are all busy people. I doubt they will find time to scrutinise these decisions.</p><p>\"Bonnie Greer was appointed to the panel last year and they make a lot of that. But, well, let's just say her attendance record hasn't been very good. I've met her. Once.\"</p><p>It has been a troubled few years for English Heritage's blue plaque panel, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jan/06/blue-plaques-cut-government-funding\" title=\"\">temporarily suspended in 2013</a> while new funding was sought after government cash had been cut.</p><p>Two panel members, Dr Celina Fox and Margaret Pelling, subsequently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10158413/Blue-Plaque-scheme-in-turmoil-as-a-quarter-of-panel-resign.html\" title=\"\">resigned in protest</a> at the need to make efficiency savings to the scheme, including cutting its support staff by 30%.</p><p>Edgerton said he would also have resigned at the time but had been assured that the character of the panel would \"continue to be one in which the people of London could and should have confidence\". But, Edgerton said, it had become clear that this would not be the case. In his resignation letter to the chairman of English Heritage, Sir Laurie Magnus, Edgerton wrote: \"By examining the addressees of the agenda for the next meeting, I discover that you are creating a panel of radically different character, one which I believe is neither appropriately expert or representative.</p><p>\"I am therefore resigning as I do not believe that such a panel, not least without an expert staff, can properly carry out the functions entrusted to it.\"</p><p>Edgerton and Darley were asked whether they wished to assist in the appointment of their replacements, but have declined. In a letter to Professor Ronald Hutton, chairman of the panel, Edgerton said: \"I don't feel able to recommend anyone, nor indeed to recommend that anyone accept an invitation to serve. I am sorry to be blunt, but English Heritage have clearly made up their mind what panel they want, and have got it.\"</p><p>In a response to Edgerton, Magnus said he had \"made a personal commitment to keep the scheme as an important part of our activities\". He added: \"We are most grateful for your contribution and hope that we will demonstrate that we have not lost touch with the key founding principles behind the blue plaques.\"</p><p>A spokesman for English Heritage said further appointments were being made, including that of Professor Martin Daunton, master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He added: \"We were disappointed to receive the resignations of two blue plaque panel members.</p><p>\"We are confident that, once complete, the panel will represent the full range of in-depth knowledge and expertise required to consider all the different blue plaque nominations.\"</p>","headline":"Accusation of 'white men off the telly takeover' of blue plaques panel","trailText":"English

White letters on a blue disc announced,  \"GAVIN TURK Sculptor worked here 1989-1991\". The joke works because the blue plaque system, paid for entirely by public funds and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/jan/06/blue-plaques-cut-government-funding\" title=\"\">administered – until now – by English Heritage</a>, carries an aura of seriousness and significance. It is the gold standard of biography and local history. If you get a blue plaque, you really must have achieved something.</p><p></p><p>The news that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20926414\" title=\"\">English Heritage is to stop issuing plaques</a> because of swingeing cuts to its funding is unlikely to be the end of a famous London tradition. But fans of the blue plaque should be careful how they respond. The obvious temptation is for boroughs, community groups, and individuals to put up plaques wherever and to whomever they want. <br />This may sound pluralistic and liberating – but Gavin Turk's witty artwork shows what a daft idea that would be. Turk broke the rules, of course, and ignored the authorities when he created a blue plaque to himself as a work of art. Yet the humour and underlying melancholy of the image (will he ever really get a blue plaque?) depends on the existence of the surreal and quintessentially British institution that sombrely decides, from on high, which Londoners should be officially remembered. The idea that a committee somewhere makes these calls has a marvellously archaic, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/in-depth/reith_1.shtml\" title=\"\">Reithian</a> quality. Rules are made to be broken, but to have that pleasure you need the rules to exist.</p><p></p><p>Blue plaques may seem an eccentric hangover from history – they have been going since <a href=\"http://www.brainyhistory.com/years/1867.html\" title=\"\">1867</a> – but it is this kind of oddity that makes a city a place of character and flavour rather than a banal conglomeration of business and glass buildings. London is at a turning point in its history. The nation's capital is about to see its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/dec/02/london-high-rise-craze-ruins-skyline\" title=\"\">skyline become a jumble of badly designed skyscrapers</a>, in an amnesiac destruction of its architectural identity. Do we want this city to lose all sense of its past? Blue plaques are one of the most charming ways a capital has ever found to preserve historical memory. They eschew the pomposity of statues.</p><p></p><p>It's not like London lacks places to remember. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/mar/23/vincent-van-gogh-home-auction\" title=\"\">Vincent van Gogh's house in Brixton</a> would be easy to lose sight of (it's just an ordinary London house) – but it has that all-important plaque.</p><p></p><p>Make no mistake. The blue plaque is irreplaceable – as Gavin Turk showed us.</p>","headline":"Blue plaques are crucial cultural landmarks","trailText":"<strong>Jonathan Jones: </strong>London stands to lose more than plaques when English Heritage stops its memorial scheme – the city's very identity is at stake","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/BOOKS/Pix/pictures/2013/1/7/1357559712735/Blue-plaque-003.jpg","wordcount":"425","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"401985932","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7096057","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Jones","internalPageCode":"1849871","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-14T11:50:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/jan/07/blue-plaques-cultural-landmarks-english-heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/jan/07/blue-plaques-cultural-landmarks-english-heritage","tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog","webTitle":"Jonathan Jones on art","type":"blog","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanjones","webTitle":"Jonathan Jones","rcsId":"GNL234013","r2ContributorId":"15906","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749334203/JonathanJones.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741000/JonathanJones.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Jones writes on art for the Guardian and was on the jury for the 2009 Turner prize</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonathanjones","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-401986408","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/BOOKS/Pix/pictures/2013/1/7/1357559709915/Blue-plaque-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Michael Walter/Troika","altText":"Blue plaque","height":"54","credit":"Michael Walter/Troika","caption":"The Blue Plaque scheme ... set to fold?

She knew many members of the royal family, she was a staunch royalist and she adored the Queen Mother, she sang at Buckingham Palace garden parties, but she was never recognised – I think it's a shame and a disgrace. So posthumously this was one thing I thought I could do for her, to campaign for the blue plaque.\"</p><p>The plaque was unveiled by the critic and author Bonnie Greer, who called her \"an inspirational figure, a beautiful gracious goddess, with an impeccable instrument in her voice\".</p><p>The only other black woman honoured with a blue plaque, unveiled five years ago, was the <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places/womens-history/women-celebrated-by-blue-plaques/\" title=\"\">19th century nurse Mary Seacole</a>. Greer said that although Welch was never a political campaigner, her quiet determination to pursue her own career was itself an example to others.</p><p>\"She presents another pathway, another option, she shows the way for any young black woman, any woman, any person who wants to go their own way in life.\"</p><p>Bourne, a friend of Welch's until her death in 2003 just short of her 100th birthday, said when she made two films with the singer Paul Robeson, who was a passionate campaigner for black civil rights, he urged her to join the fight. \"She said 'Paul, my father was African and native American, my mother was Scottish and Irish, I've got four people within me, I can't make a stand for all of them, you'll have to excuse me.' He roared with laughter and hugged her, and the subject was never mentioned again.\"</p><p>Welch, who was born in New York in 1904, and first launched the Charleston craze on Broadway – a song she detested for its idiotic lyrics, according to Bourne – also became famous for her performance of Porter's Love For Sale, a song then seen as a scandalous reference to prostitution.</p><p>She partly came to Paris and then London to escape discrimination, became renowned as a cabaret and club singer, and in 1934 became the first black broadcaster to win her own BBC radio series, Soft Lights and Sweet Music.</p><p>Her career was relaunched at the age of 75 when Derek Jarman included her heart-stopping performance of her signature song, Stormy Weather – which she first sang in 1933 – in his 1979 film The Tempest. The scene of her singing with unruffled serenity<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=857Ste6wylM\" title=\"\"> surrounded by a chorus line of half naked sailors</a>, was described by George Melly as \"arguably the campest, most sparkling moment in the history of cinema\".</p><p>She starred aged 81 in a Donmar Warehouse revue, Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood, which transferred and brought her back to rapturous acclaim on Broadway after half a century.</p><p>After Welch's death Bourne discovered that she had had a long discreet affair in the 1930s with the newspaper heir David Astor. Astor was then unmarried, and Welch's brief marriage to a fellow musician had ended in his death – but the affair never became public and ended when his formidable mother Nancy Astor intervened. On the day Astor married another woman, Bourne discovered, Welch took a rare day's sick leave from the West End show she was appearing in.</p><p>Greer said: \"The last year I lived in New York was 1986, and all the talk then was of two singers – Whitney Houston, and Miss Welch, and they had much in common in representing another tradition in black music, in their approach to their art, in their perfectionism and integrity. There was a danger that Miss Welch, somebody who never banged a drum for themselves, or went for the huge film roles, could have been forgotten in the shadows. That should not be allowed to happen.\"</p>","headline":"Elisabeth Welch honoured with English Heritage blue plaque","trailText":"Singer who had own radio series and was nominated for Olivier and Tony awards is second black woman to be so honoured","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/1/1330626426107/WELCH-003.jpg","wordcount":"720","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"386756643","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"5865853","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Maev Kennedy","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-03-02T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1711716","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-04T18:27:53Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/01/elisabeth-welch-english-heritage-blue-plaque","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/mar/01/elisabeth-welch-english-heritage-blue-plaque","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","rcsId":"GNL004696","r2ContributorId":"16031","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/maev_kennedy_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-386756814","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/1/1330626423237/WELCH-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Rene Perez","altText":"WELCH","height":"54","credit":"Rene Perez/AP","caption":"American-born singer Elisabeth Welch lived in London for 70 years and was the first black person to have their own BBC radio series.

The inspectors praised the \"more or less symmetrical profile\" of the city's waterfront, with the Three Graces – the Port of Liverpool and the Liver and Cunard buildings – at centre stage and historical docklands to the north complementing those to the south.</p><p>The Graces were \"at the heart of the shipping and harbour operations during the height of [Liverpool's] glory, surrounded by dockyards and port structures,\" they said. The £5.5bn Peel Holdings development would \"[relegate] the Three Graces to playing second violin … thereby losing an important visual and historical reference to the city's glorious past.\"</p><p>The council leader, Joe Anderson, said Liverpool was not a museum and investment was crucial to the city's future.</p><p>\"Today's decision to grant planning permission for Liverpool Waters is one of the most significant and far-reaching made in Liverpool's recent history. It is a vote of confidence in a new beginning of a great city,\" he said.</p><p>\"Liverpool has to grow and redevelop if we are to thrive and succeed in the future. We do not live in the past, we are not a museum. I care passionately about the future of Liverpool and the opportunities and life chances we give our children.</p><p>\"Today's decision is for future generations. The new investment, businesses and employment opportunities Liverpool Waters will bring is the future for our city.\"</p><p>The Liverpool Waters plans feature 9,000 flats, hundreds of offices, hotels, bars and a cruise terminal, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other high-rises. It involves two clusters of tall buildings, one near the city centre and a second further north.</p><p>English Heritage said it was disappointed by the decision and unhappy with the council's assessment which, it said, downplayed the adverse impacts of the development on Liverpool's heritage.</p><p>It said the scheme would \"severely compromise\" the setting of some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings, risk damaging the archaeological remains of parts of the docks and unbalance the city's urban landscape.</p><p>Henry Owen-John, planning director for the north-west at English Heritage, said: \"The decision is in no way a surprise because it has been presented very much as a choice between jobs and growth on one side and heritage on the other. We are really disappointed that it has been presented like that because we have always believed that it was possible to develop a scheme that maximised heritage and developed jobs and growth.\"</p>","headline":"Liverpool Waters skyscraper plans get council go-ahead despite heritage fears","trailText":"<p>English Heritage's formal objection means £5.5bn scheme will be referred to

Heritage update at-risk register, which is growing faster than buildings are being saved","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T09:01:29Z","body":"<p>One of the first atomic bomb stores built in England has joined a bell foundry, a fairground rollercoaster and a tumble of stones which may once have been a monks' kitchen among more than 5,800 important listed buildings and structures which appear on the latest <a href=\"http://risk.english-heritage.org.uk/register.aspx\" title=\"\">English Heritage at-risk register</a>.</p><p>Although thousands of buildings have been rescued since the register was first launched in 1998, the list is growing faster than buildings are being saved, a situation worsened by government cuts to English Heritage's funding. In the past year, 318 sites have been saved and removed from the register, but 360 new sites have been added.</p><p>Many make the list because their original purpose has vanished – fortunately in the case of the scruffy sheds and towers at Thetford Heath in Suffolk which was one of Britain's first purpose built stores for atomic bombs. They were top secret when built in the early 1950s to house the RAF's first atomic bomb, codenamed Blue Danube, using a special grit-free surface to prevent the risk of sparks. The explosive components were stored separately in deep thick walled pits, and ringed with watch towers, triple wire security fences and guard posts. They were decommissioned within a decade, and no longer secret, soon targeted by vandals. <a href=\"http://http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx\" title=\"\">They are now listed at Grade II*</a>, the second highest category, recognising their importance in the history of Britain and the cold war.</p><p>The current owners have worked with English Heritage to repair the watch towers and the kiosks which housed the nuclear components, but much remains to be done, and even the most ardent conservationist would find it hard to dream up a new use for such a site — the problem for the most intractable cases on the at-risk register, including old industrial sites, hospitals and other sites which have lost their original function and have no obvious economically viable new role which could pay for the restoration work.</p><p>Just 13% of the 5,831 buildings and sites on the register are considered economic to repair. For the rest – such as The Monks' Oven, a heap of stones in a green field in Cumbria believed to be part of a medieval monastery – the total gap between the cost of restoration and the amount they could ever earn is now estimated at £423m, up from £330m in 2007, an average of £366,000 per site. Over the same period government funding for English Heritage has repeatedly been slashed, so that its grants budget has been cut in turn by 40% in real terms.</p><p>That dismal picture is about to worsen, as English Heritage appeals for volunteers and local societies and groups to help survey the condition of England's 385,000 Grade II listed buildings, which make up 92% of all listed buildings. Outside London these have never been included in the annual at-risk surveys, because the scale of the task was beyond English Heritage resources. If the guesstimate that at least 5% of such buildings are in trouble, next year's at risk register will swell dramatically.</p><p>A pilot project has already been launched in Lincolnshire, where <a href=\"http://www.lincsheritage.org/htl/index.php\" title=\"\">Heritage Lincolnshire </a>has almost completed the survey: preliminary results suggest that 6.1% of the Grade II buildings are at risk. One man, retired accountant Graham Umpleby, from Boston, has single-handedly collected most of the bad news, scrambling through nettles and over tumbledown walls to complete surveys of more than 9,000 sites.</p><p>Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said the Grade II buildings were of enormous importance to their areas. \"When one of them is lost, it's as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past; something that made your street or your village special will have gone.\"</p><p>There is better news for some sites. One of the apparently hopeless cases, the burned out shell of the 1919 wooden Scenic Railway roller coaster in Margate, the first fairground ride to win Grade II* listed status, has won a lottery grant and with the help of <a href=\"http://www.dreamlandmargate.com/\" title=\"\">a local trust</a> is planned as the centrepiece of a restored Dreamland funfair. Repairs are almost complete at the crescent at Buxton, once the glory of the Derbyshire spa town.</p><p>The buildings of <a href=\"http://www.taylorbells.co.uk/web/?q=node/1\" title=\"\">Taylor's Bell Foundry</a> in Loughborough, which in 1851 cast one of the largest bells in the world, Great Paul for St Paul's cathedral, appear on the list for the first time this year. The buildings are Victorian, but the most recent in a line of bellfounders dating back to the 14th century. The firm was rescued from administration in 2009, but the buildings - the only purpose built bell foundry in England - have suffered from generations of neglect or inappropriate repairs. English Heritage has offered a project development grant, and there are plans for restoration and more public access to the site.</p><p>Edward Impey, director of heritage protection at English Heritage, said: \"There has never been a time when imagination and commitment has been more important.\"</p>","headline":"A-bomb store and monks' kitchen on risk list as threat to heritage

But cutbacks mean that no more of the blue plaques commemorating the birthplaces, homes and other London landmarks associated with historic figures will be approved until funding is found in two years' time.</p><p>A plaque to be unveiled next week in Great Russell Street for architect John Nash is expected to be among the last after the announcement by English Heritage of the suspension of the blue plaques scheme, which the body blamed on a 34% cut in its overall funding from government.</p><p>There are currently 869 of the plaques, put up as part of the scheme established in 1866 and believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world.</p><p>A number of plaques that have already been approved are still expected to be installed by a team reduced to two full-time employees.</p><p>The plaques cost an average of £965 to install, while English Heritage's budget is dropping from £130m in 2010-11 to £92m in 2014.</p><p>The scheme was started by the Royal Society of Arts and has been run by English Heritage since 1986.</p><p>Recently approved plaques include one in memory of the historian and broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/ajp-taylor/\" title=\"\">AJP Taylor (1906-1990), known as \"</a>Tthe history man\", who is to be commemorated at 13 St Mark's Crescent, Primrose Hill, where he lived from 1955 to 1978.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/idamann/\" title=\"\">Other recent approvals include a plaque for Dame Ida Mann (1893-1983)</a>, a pioneering ophthalmologist and trailblazer for women in medicine, who is to be commemorated at 13 Minster Road, West Hampstead – her childhood home. Plaques were unveiled last year in memory of Fred Perry, Britain's most successful male tennis player, Constance Spry, florist for the Queen's wedding and coronation, and the writers, Jean Rhys and Elizabeth Bowen.</p><p>The only previous time installations have been stopped was between 1915 to 1919 and 1940 to 1947, coinciding with the wartime economies of the first and second world wars.</p><p>A spokeswoman for English Heritage said: \"Following our 34% funding cut in the 2010 spending settlement, English Heritage commissioners made the decision that the blue plaques scheme was to be funded in an alternative way in the future.</p><p>\"As a step towards creating a new and more self-sustaining scheme, the blue plaques team will be reduced to two people during 2013.</p><p>\"They will continue to erect plaques already agreed by the independent advisory panel and work up the details of a new approach to running the scheme that will be announced in 2014.\"</p><p>The heritage body said its decision to reduce staff and suspend new installations would allow it to make savings of £240,000 over the next two years. Possible sources of finance after 2014 could come from private investment or other heritage foundations, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>• This article was amended on 7 January 2013. The original said funding for blue plaques would drop from £130m in 2010-11 to £92m in 2014.
