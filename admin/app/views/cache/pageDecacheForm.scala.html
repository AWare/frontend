    <h3>Usage Warnings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This tool performs a <b><i>hard</i></b> purge of the cached content on www.theguardian.com. This will <b>immediately stop the cached content from being served</b> to visitors to the site.</li>
        <li>If the backend service that provides the content is not healthy, <b>errors will immediately be served to all visitors trying to reach the content.</b></li>
        <li>If you are trying to resolve an issue and have not already done so, please use the <a href="@controllers.admin.routes.TroubleshooterController.index()">Troubleshoot Tool</a></li>
        <li>If the initial test below is unsuccessful, continuing with the purge should only be done in the case of takedowns.</li>
    </ul>
