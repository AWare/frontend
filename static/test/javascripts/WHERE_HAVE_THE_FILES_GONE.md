### tl;dr

`static/test/javascripts-legacy`

### Longer version

In preparation for the move to ES6, all ES5 source JS tests has been moved to `static/test/javascripts-legacy`.

You can just edit them there as normal for now, we'll make sure everyone knows what's happening when the conversion starts.

It's probably not a good idea to convert anything till then...it might well break!
