# Deploys Radiator

Unfortunately this cannot be accessed in production right now due to network
restrictions (AWS can't talk to RiffRaff), however it is easy to run locally.

You will need the follow properties:

```
teamcity.host
riffraff.apikey
riffraff.url
github.token
```

The radiator can be accessed at `/deploys-radiator`.
