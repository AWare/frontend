    <p>Since partition in 1947, Kashmir has been the subject of three India-Pakistan wars.</p>

    <p>Thousands were killed in Indian-controlled Kashmir during an insurgency that broke out in 1990 and continues to the present day. Some Kashmiri groups demand greater autonomy from Delhi while others push for an independent state. Some also agitate for Kashmir to be absorbed into Pakistan.</p>

    <p>India has frequently been accused of committing human rights abuses including torture, rape, secret detention and extrajudicial executions. Militants have also been accused of harming civilians.</p>

    <p>Protests, usually featuring stone-pelting, surged last year after security forces killed militant leader Burhan Wani.</p>
