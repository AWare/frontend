    <p><strong>What kind of life does she emerge into?</strong> Manning enters the civilian world as a celebrity transgender woman who is regarded as a hero on the left and within the LGBT community, but a traitor among conservatives and many in the military.</p>

    <p><strong>Where will she live?</strong> She has indicated she wants to return to Maryland, where she was based before she entered the army. </p>

    <p><strong>What is her military status?</strong> Her conviction remains in place, and as a result her active military status. Her lawyers are continuing to appeal her conviction and until that process is completed she will not be discharged from the army.</p>

    <p><strong>How will she make ends meet?</strong> There are several <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/welcomehomechelsea">fundraising</a> <a href="https://www.couragefound.org/appeal-fund/">efforts</a> <a href="https://hugsforchelsea.bandcamp.com/">underway</a> to help her transition to civilian life and cover her legal fees. She will be in demand as a commentator and speaker.</p>
