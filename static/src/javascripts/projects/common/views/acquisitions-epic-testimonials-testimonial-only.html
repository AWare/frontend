        </h2>

        <p>
            I read it fairly often and enjoy the variety of news and entertainment content.
            It never occurred to me that you wanted contributions, but I'd like you to stick around.
            Sometimes you actually have to pay for stuff you like. Go figure. - Mike L

        <p>
            Our reporting takes a lot of time,
            hard work and money to produce and is increasingly funded by readers like Mike.
            Support the Guardian and help us keep our journalism open to everyone.
